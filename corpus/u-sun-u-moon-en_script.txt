That’s how it works.\nGo ahead and give it a try.

Battle preparation
All right. Let’s move on to battle preparation.
You don’t have enough teammates.\nPlease ask some Trainers to be your teammates.
Would you like to prepare for your battles?\nWhat would you like to do?
Would you like to select this Pokémon?
It seems there are no Trainers you can ask\nto be your teammates yet.\c\nTo ask Trainers to be your teammates, please\nuse StreetPass.
I’ll give you Festival Coins to commemorate your\nvictory against Trainers.
Please take this.
Oh!! Who are you?\nI’ll beat you![VAR 0114(0033)]
You’ve come a long way...\nIt’s time for me to get serious![VAR 0114(0010)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0020)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], your grade will go up with\n[VAR NUM1(0001)] more successful challenge[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s.
You’re currently in the middle of your challenge\nat the Battle Agency.\c\nA boss will appear if you have [VAR NUM1(0000)] more\nsuccessful challenge[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.
A boss will appear if you have\n[VAR NUM1(0000)] more successful challenge[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.
You’ve reached grade 50 and cleared the\nBattle Agency! Congratulations!\c\nFrom now on, for every five successful\nchallenges, you’ll receive a reward.
Pokémon have type matchups.\c\nIt’s a shortcut to victory to know which type\nyour Pokémon is weak against or strong against.
It’s also effective to swap Pokémon in or out\nduring a battle.\c\nIf your Pokémon is weak to the opposing\nPokémon, swapping it out can be advantageous.
Do you check your Pokémon’s Ability?\c\nAbilities may be different even among the\nsame species of Pokémon.
Sometimes defense is more important\nthan offense.\c\nMoves that change statuses are also useful.
You might want to consider swapping out your\nPokémon if you think the opposing Pokémon\r\ncould use a supereffective move against it.
Do you pay attention to changes in the\nopposing Pokémon’s stats?\c\nTouch the icon of the Pokémon, and you can\nsee its stat changes.
You should check if your Pokémon is good at\nphysical attacks or special attacks.\c\nIt may be effective to use physical moves on\na Pokémon that seems to be strong against\r\nspecial attacks.
Even if the power of two moves is the same,\nif one move’s type is the same as the\r\nPokémon’s type, it will be more powerful than\r\na move of a different type.
If your Pokémon’s Speed stat is higher than\nthe opponent’s, your Pokémon can use a move\r\nbefore the opponent.\c\nIt may be a good idea to compare Speed and\ncreate a strategy.
If your Pokémon in battle doesn’t have a\nsupereffective move, why don’t you swap it\r\nout for another Pokémon?
Last but not least, we request that you project\nthe proper look as an agent at the\r\nBattle Agency. Good luck!
Your grade is now [VAR NUM2(0000)].\nCongratulations!\c\nI’d like to give you something.\nI’m pretty sure they’ll look cool on you.
You received Agent Sunglasses.
Installing a battle program...\nType “[VAR 010E(0000)].”

Next, please ask other Trainers to join your\nteam to battle with you.
Next is to ask other Trainers to join your team\nto battle with you, but you don’t seem to know\r\nTrainers who you can ask to join your team.\c\nTo ask Trainers to be your teammates, please\nuse StreetPass.
Please select Challenge to start your challenge,\nM[VAR GENDBR(0000,0101)]rs. [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
You succeeded in your challenge!\c\nYour talent as an agent has been recognized,\nand you have received a grade.\c\nWe hope for your further success!
Since your grade is now [VAR NUM2(0000)], a battle setting to\nfurther test your ability as an agent will appear.\c\nThat means a weather effect or a field effect\nwill be added at the beginning of a battle.\c\nCreate a battle strategy by selecting Pokémon\nwith certain types or moves, depending on the\r\nbattle setting.\c\nReselecting Pokémon at an exchange center—\nSwitcheroo in Festival Plaza—is effective.

Welcome to the Battle Tree. I’m the receptionist.
How can I help you?
What would you like to hear about?
You can enjoy various kinds of battles with\nmany different Trainers here.\c\nYou can choose either Single Battles, Double\nBattles, or Multi Battles.\c\nYou’ll be competing to see how many Trainers\nyou can win your way through in a row.\c\nIf you lose even once, your win streak will\nend there. You’ll have to start over from zero,\r\nso please be careful.\c\nThere are two courses in the Battle Tree—\nNormal Course and Super Course.\c\nIf you clear the Normal Course, the Super\nCourse will become available.\c\nEach time you defeat a Trainer you’ll receive\nBattle Points, or BP, that you can use to scout\r\nTrainers or exchange for prizes.\c\nThe longer your win streak, the more BP\nyou’ll receive.\c\nDo your best to set an awesome record!
There are three important points you need to\nkeep in mind to battle at the Battle Tree.\c\nFirst, some Pokémon are not allowed in the\nSuper Course while all Pokémon are\r\nallowed in the Normal Course. Battles in the\r\nSuper Course are held under Flat Rules.\c\nAny Pokémon higher than Lv. 50 will have\ntheir level lowered to 50.\c\nSecond, you’ll need a certain number of\nPokémon for your battles.\c\nYou’ll need three for Single Battles, four for\nDouble Battles, and for Multi Battles, each\r\nTrainer will need two.\c\nAnd the last thing, you can’t use more than one\nof the same Pokémon or item in your battles.\c\nHowever, if your partner in a Multi Battle has\nthe same Pokémon or item as you, that’s not\r\na problem.
We hope to see you again.
Which battle format do you want?

This is the Battle Royal reception desk!
Welcome to the Battle Royal!\nWe welcome you, Champion!
Would you like to have a Battle Royal?
What rank will you enter as?
Would you like to take part in a Hyper Rank\nBattle Royal match?
Would you like to take part in a Master Rank\nBattle Royal match?
A Pokémon Battle Royal takes part between four\nTrainers, who each bring three Pokémon into the\r\nring for a four-way free-for-all!\c\nEvery other Trainer in the ring is an opponent,\nand the goal of each match is to win your way\r\nthrough to victory against them all.\c\nOnce any of the participating Trainers have all\nthree of their Pokémon faint and can no longer\r\nbattle, the match ends.\c\nWhichever Trainer is in first place at the point\nwhen the battle ends will be the winner.\c\nPlaces are decided by how many Pokémon\nyou’ve defeated and how many you have left.\c\nYou score higher by defeating more Pokémon\nand having fewer Pokémon on your team faint.\c\nIf you tie with another Trainer based on these\ntwo factors, then the one who defeated more\r\nPokémon will be declared the winner.\c\nIf it’s still a tie, then whoever has the most\nnet HP left will be declared the winner.\c\nTry your best to knock out as many other\nPokémon as possible while keeping your\r\nPokémon from fainting!\c\nBattle Royals are sorted into four ranks: Normal,\nSuper, Hyper, and Master. Once you clear a\r\nrank, you can try the next rank.\c\nIn the Normal Rank, any Pokémon higher than\nLv. 30 will have their level lowered to Lv. 30,\r\nand in the other ranks, any Pokémon higher\r\nthan Lv. 50 will have their level lowered to\r\nLv. 50, so be careful.\c\nNow that we’ve reviewed all that, let me ask\nyou once again...
Then please select the Pokémon you would\nlike to battle with.
I am the Masked Royal!\c\nI heard about your efforts here at the Battle\nDome, and it made me want to battle you!\r\nLet’s do this. Woo!
It looks like you’re all ready for battle.\nThen please come this way.
Then we hope you’ll come back again!
Good effort today!
Congratulations on your win!\c\nYou tried really hard today, [VAR TRNICK(0000)].\nYou and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] both!
You’ll be promoted up to Super Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
You’ll be promoted up to Hyper Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
You’ll be promoted up to Master Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
Now that you’ve won a Master Rank match,\nI’ll present you with a special stamp!
Please accept your BP from the battle.
You received [VAR NUM1(0001)] BP!
We look forward to your next Battle Royal!
That was great fun, oh yeah!\nLet’s do it again sometime!
I’ll participate
Not right now
Tell me more
Now that you’ve stood at the pinnacle of the\nBattle Royal, it feels like you might be able to\r\nreally nail a new battle style...

An Alolan Picture Book\nWherein a Pikachu, Pyukumuku, and Slowpoke\nprepare to set out on an island challenge—but\nthe preparations themselves are so fun and\nexhausting that they never leave home!
On How to Heal Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
On the Origins of the Alola Region\nThe islands of Alola were given form when\nunderwater volcanoes erupted long, long ago.\nPokémon came to live in Alola when they flew,\nswam, or were carried on the wind to the isles.
On the Number of Pokémon Moves\nAs of this writing, scholars in this field have\nidentified more than 600 distinct moves that\ncan be used by Pokémon in battle.\c\nYet each Pokémon is only able to remember\na maximum of four moves at a time.\nTo learn a fifth move, it must forget one of the\nother moves that it knows.\c\nAdditionally, it must be noted that there are\nalso many different ways through which\nPokémon are able to learn moves.\nThere is still much for us to learn about the\nrelationship of Pokémon and their moves.
On the Classification of Pokémon Moves\nPokémon moves can be divided into three broad\ncategories: physical moves, special moves, and\nof course status moves.\c\nPHYSICAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSPECIAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Sp. Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Sp. Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSTATUS MOVES\nMoves that have effects other than directly\nattacking another target in battle.

Welcome to the Pokémon Center Café!\nIt’s about [VAR NUM2(0000)]:00 now in Alola.\c\nHere in our café space, we provide a moment of\npeace to our customers.
Please come visit us again soon!
What can I get started for you today?
Lemonade
Tapu Cocoa
Moomoo Milk
Pinap Juice
Roserade Tea
Komala Coffee
A [VAR 01C2(0002)] will be $[VAR NUM3(0001)].\nWill that be all right?
This is our café’s original blend, made with\nplenty of freshly picked Alolan Berries.\c\nIts intensely sweet flavor will linger on\npleasantly for hours.
Just one sip and you’ll be hooked.\c\nThis milk is so mellow, yet rich, that it’ll \nmake you wish your mother were a Miltank.
Please enjoy the harmonious tones of sweet\nand sour that can only be performed by Pinap\r\ngrown under the Alolan sun.
We’ve mixed up all different kinds of Berries to\nmake this special Lemonade!\c\nThe refreshing sweetness of it might just\nswallow you!
Moomoo Milk!\c\nGulping it down will bring a smile to your face\nand your heart!
This highly aromatic tea is made with extracts\nfrom Roserade’s favorite leaves.\c\nWhen you drink it, you may find yourself wanting\nto Petal Dance.
Never mind
When your adventures have tired you out,\nit’s time to relax with a hot cup of Tapu Cocoa.\r\nYou’ll love it iced, too.
Pinap Berries don’t deal well with wind or cold.\nHere in the Alola region, however, they can grow\r\nto their full potential under the Alolan sun.\c\nMeaning they’re really delicious.
Enjoy this mellow tea made from the Pokémon \nRoserade’s favorite leaves which we\r\nhave fermented.
This Lemonade is made artisanally by hand, so it\nmust be better than what you get out of a\r\nvending machine.\c\nIt is, right?
Chocolate cream...\c\nTapu Cocoa is so good it’ll make you\ncompletely forget about counting calories!\c\nMaybe I’ll stop worrying about my blood sugar\nlevel and have some, too.
Don’t you think sour juice makes your body\nfeel great?\c\nOf course it’s just a feeling, but I guarantee\nthe taste.
Such a rich and mellow flavor...\c\nTapu Cocoa makes you feel so warm inside,\nit’s as if the tapu are watching over you.
You try to stay cool when you taste the\nspiciness, and you try to act strong when the\r\nsourness hits you.\c\nTry gulping down a glass of Pinap Juice\nlike that!
Coffee from Alola is famous all over the world.\c\nEven the timid Pokémon Granbull, with its scary\nface, can’t help but smile when it drinks some.
Drinking Tapu Cocoa improves your\ncirculation, allowing you to feel more relaxed.\c\nMixing in a little salt is also quite nice.
We’ve pressed the skins of Pinap Berries,\nfreshly picked on Akala, to make this juice.\c\nI ate all the flesh myself! It was crazy spicy!
The bitterness comes pouring out...\c\nJust one sip could knock you out like the\nPokémon Komala.
This Moomoo Milk is made with milk I\njust collected.\c\nAllow it to roll gently across your tongue as you\ndrink it.
When you peel a Pinap Berry, it’ll make your\nfingers tingle.\c\nBut I guarantee this juice is even better than\nthe Berry Juice that Shuckle make!
I became an apprentice to a mysterious barista\nand, after many struggles, I am finally allowed to\r\nbrew some coffee.\c\nWhat I have brewed is this mythical\nKomala Coffee.
We’ve crushed all kinds of Berries and mixed\nthem all up!\c\nHuzzah for you, who ordered this\nspecial Lemonade!
It’s good to gulp down fresh Moomoo Milk.
When you taste Roserade Tea, you’ll first notice\na Sweet Scent filling your nose.\c\nDrink it while it’s hot, before you miss out on\nthe fullness of its aroma!
Here in the Alola region we can harvest\nmany Berries, so we use over 50 kinds of\r\nBerries to make this.\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to use so many, so I\njust throw in about 47.
This Tapu Cocoa is our specialty here.\c\nBy the way, did you know the English word\n“taboo” may have its origins here in Alola?\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
You can get Moomoo Milk from Miltank.\c\nThis is just between you and me, but there’s a\nGym Leader named Whitney in Goldenrod City\r\nwith a Miltank.\c\nI heard that you can get some real tip-top\nMoomoo Milk from her Miltank. \c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
This is the finest Tapu Cocoa I have ever\nmade in my life. Please savor it.\c\nOf course I will continue to work hard to\nsurpass even this Tapu Cocoa.
In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
I’ll be able to brew and offer you the finest\ncoffee only if I continue Pokémon battling and\r\nsurpass my master, a mysterious barista.
By using Berries that have become almost too\nripe to eat, our Lemonade here has a depth like\r\nnone other.\c\nWe’re quite proud of just how sour it is.
We had to battle Roserade to gather all the\nleaves for this tea.\c\nEnjoy it to your heart’s content. If you don’t, my\ngrandson who gathered the leaves will never\r\nfind peace.
We blend beans that we import from\na distant region.\c\nIn other words, you can experience not just one\nnovel flavor but several!\c\nIt might not actually be correct to call this\nKomala Coffee.
Got it! Then if you’ll just give me a moment...
Here you are!\c\nOne [VAR 01C2(0002)] just for you!
I’m sorry, but it looks like you don’t quite have\nenough this time.\c\nBut I really do appreciate how much you love\nour drinks, and I thank you for stopping by!
Here you are. This will make you feel better.
Here you are. This will clear your head.
Here you are. This will wake you up.

This is the best Moomoo Milk in all of Alola!\c\nI won’t bother you with all the details of\neverything it took to get it here to you, but try\r\nto imagine while you’re drinking it.\c\nBy the way, if you don’t finish it all, can I have\nthe rest?
I brew very strong Roserade Tea because if it\nwas weak, you wouldn’t get the stimulation you\r\nwant no matter how many cups you drink of it.\c\nIf you want to make it weaker, add Moomoo Milk\nlittle by little.
If you’re feeling comatose, it’s time for a\nKomala Coffee. The flavor’s still a work in\r\nprogress, though.\c\nThe water we get up here on the mountain is\ncold, so it’s hard to get the flavor right.
Did you know the “-ade” part of Lemonade\noriginally comes from the Kalos region?
This Tapu Cocoa has been prepared with\nplenty of Moomoo Milk to give it the richest\r\nflavor possible.
Drinking Roserade Tea up here near the stars...\nIsn’t the thought of it delicious?
This is a popular snack in Lumiose City in the\nKalos region.
This candy bar is a specialty from Mahogany\nTown in the Johto region.
This ice cream is a specialty from Castelia City\nin the Unova region.
This is authentic food from Eterna City in the\nSinnoh region.
This snack is a specialty of Shalour City in the\nKalos region.
These cookies are a specialty from Lavaridge\nTown in the Hoenn region.
This chocolate is just ridiculously sweet.
You’re limited to one per day, but have a tea\nbiscuit on us.
We’d like to offer your Pokémon something on\nthe house.
Poké Beans are a specialty in Alola, and\nPokémon love to eat them!\c\nFeed them to your Pokémon in Pokémon\nRefresh, and they’ll become more affectionate!
By the way, do you give your\nPokémon nicknames?\c\nYou know, no one can change those names\nbesides the Trainer who gave them to\r\nthe Pokémon.\c\nIf you trade a Pokémon away, it will always\nkeep the nickname you gave it.\c\nYou better think long and hard about what\nnicknames to give your Pokémon.
By the way, are you saving your progress?\c\nIt can be kind of a pain to save your progress\nsometimes.\c\nIt is important, though, so do try to save often.
By the way, are you going to Festival Plaza?\nYou can connect with other Trainers anytime!\c\nThere’s an exclamation symbol that lets you\nknow when events are going on, too.
By the way, are you going to the Poké Pelago?\c\nMy Pokémon are spending their days on an\nisland far away from me.\c\nI hope they’re having a good time out there...
By the way, are you using the Poké Finder?\c\nIt lets you capture all your\nunforgettable moments.\c\nIt’s so lovely that you can save all your precious\nmemories forever.
By the way, are you using Pokémon Refresh?\c\nWhen I catch new Pokémon, I make sure to\ntake really good care of them.\c\nIt bothers me when they get dirty in battles.\nI spend all my downtime taking care of them.
By the way, are you riding Stoutland?\c\nYou can find all kinds of stuff when you’re\nriding that Pokémon.\c\nI get so into it when I ride Stoutland that I\ncompletely lose track of time.
By the way, are you watching Battle Videos?\c\nI like battling, so I’m hooked on taking and\nwatching videos.\c\nI’ve stayed up all night doing it and been late to\nwork here before!
By the way, are you checking out your\nTrainer Passport?\c\nI get a bit wistful when I look at all the stamps\nI’ve gotten in mine.\c\nI guess I’m just the sentimental type.
By the way, are you using\nQuick Link?\c\nWhen you’ve got too many friends around, you\nmight not know who you’ll connect with.\c\nYou really can connect quickly, though, so it’s\nstill really convenient.
By the way, are you visiting the\nPokémon Nursery?\c\nWhen you drop off a male Pokémon and a female\nPokémon who get along well there for a while,\r\napparently sometimes you’ll find an Egg.
By the way, are you gathering Poké Beans?\c\nPeople give them to Pokémon or roast them\nand use them as coffee beans.\c\nThat’s a foodstuff that has a long history here\nin Alola.\c\nApparently the Poké Beans you can get from\nMohn’s Poké Pelago are the best these days.
When you get to be my age, it really makes you\nthink about things.\c\nThey say time is money, but time itself is\nactually really important.\c\nI mean, you can never buy more time for\nyourself with money, right?\c\nThe present is truly a present. Once it’s gone,\nyou can never get it back.
The reason I run a café is because everybody’s\nalways rushing around and busy these days.\c\nI hope people can come here and relax, even if\nit’s just for a little while.
These days you can easily communicate with\npeople all over the world.\c\nKeep in mind that there are time differences in\nthe world, though.\c\nWhat I mean to say is that it isn’t necessarily\nthe same time for you and whatever Trainer\r\nyou’re communicating with.\c\nDepending on what time you’re trying to\ncommunicate with other Trainers, you might find\r\nit easier to connect to Trainers from a\r\ncertain country.
Once time has passed you by, it will never come\nback. And no one is selling more time\r\nanywhere, either.\c\nThat’s what makes time so important for all\nof us.\c\nWhen you’re late for an appointment, it’s like\nyou’re stealing the other person’s time.\c\nI was often late for dates with my wife, so she\nused to give me an earful!
Time is the same for everyone.\c\nWhether you’re outside playing or laying around\nsleeping, time just keeps on flowing.\c\nHow you spend it is up to you. Remember that\ntime you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
Vehicles sure are convenient.\c\nYou can get to where you’re going a whole lot\nfaster than if you had to walk everywhere.\c\nSo by convenient, I mean that they’ll save you a\nlot of time.
Each day the sun rises, filling the world\nwith light.\c\nEach of us grows big and strong, bathing in its\nlight so bright.\c\nEach night the moon rises and quietly\nshines down.\c\nEach of us wrapped in peaceful silence, not one\nheart with a frown.\c\nI wrote that poem myself. We take for granted\nthat the sun and the moon keep shining down\r\non us, but we shouldn’t forget to be grateful.
Long ago, months were decided by the moon,\nand days by the sun.\c\nThe sun and the moon have always been\nessential for our way of life.
The little planet we live on revolves around\nthe sun...\c\nAnd the moon revolves around our planet...\c\nHey, have you ever stopped to think about what\nit is your life revolves around?
By the way, are you using Festival Plaza?\c\nYou can connect with someone anytime and\nspend some time together.\c\nDon’t you think all the things you can do at\nFestival Plaza are miraculous?
You can have Pokémon battles with your friends\nor with people you don’t know.\c\nBattles can get so hot that you completely lose\ntrack of time.
Those who keep moving have more time than\nthose who don’t move at all.\c\nThat’s not some kind of riddle, it’s\nscientific fact.\c\nOnce I learned that, I started to more carefully\nconsider how I spend my time.
You got some Poké Beans!
Oh, you’ve given your Pokémon\n[VAR NUM6(0000,002C)] Poké Bean[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.
Poké Beans make Pokémon happy. I think I’ll\ngive you a present!
Try giving your Pokémon some Poké Beans when\nyour island challenge gets rough.
That Alola Photo Club sure is something...\c\nPutting together the various poses and the\nhundreds of different Pokémon to come up\r\nwith the perfect photo...\c\nBoy, when you pull it off just right, it sure does\ngive you a sense of accomplishment!\c\nPlus, you’ve made yourself a memory with your\nPokémon that you can treasure forever, too.
So tell me, friend, what do you think of that\nMantine Surfing?\c\nSome people seem to see it as a bit of fun. And\nother people take it as seriously as any battle.\c\nEither way, facing off against the wild waves\nnature throws your way, with only the moves\r\nyou can pull off together with a Pokémon...\c\nThe scale of it simply takes my breath away!
The Battle Agency, huh...\c\nIt’s all a question of who you’re going to partner\nup with and which Pokémon you choose to use.\c\nFighting your way forward even in a situation\nthat you can’t fully control...\c\nWell, maybe I’m the only one who sees it as\na kind of metaphor for how you sometimes have\r\nto take fate head on in life and try to defy it.

Hi. There’s this Pokémon that I’m looking for.\nI want [VAR PKNAME(0002)]. Do you have one?\c\nWould you trade it for my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Thank you!\c\nI’ll be good to your [VAR PKNAME(0002)],\nso please be nice to my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Wait! That Pokémon isn’t [VAR PKNAME(0002)].\nI guess you don’t want to trade with me.
Oh, OK.\nIf you change your mind, please come see me.\r\nI’ll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me!\nI really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to\r\ntake good care of it!
Sorry! I can’t trade with a person who has only\none Pokémon.
Hello!\nYou’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nHave you caught Spearow?\nWill you trade it for my Hawlucha?
Thank you, thank you!\c\nI’ll take good care of your Spearow, so please\ntake good care of my Hawlucha!
Hmm... That is not Spearow...\nWhen you can trade, let me know.
I see.\nIf you change your mind, please let me know!
Yay! I’m so happy!\nI’ll take very good care of your Pokémon!
Uh-oh. Sorry.\c\nI can’t trade with a Trainer who has only\none Pokémon.
I have Noibat in case I get in trouble in\nBrooklet Hill, but if you’d like, please trade it\r\nfor your Lillipup.
Let’s trade!
Huh? That’s not Lillipup.\nIf you want to trade with me, speak to me again!
Wha—? You don’t want to trade?\nLet me know when you want to trade with me!
Wow!\nLillipup is so cute!\c\nNoibat is indescribably cute, too!\nSo please take good care of my Pokémon!
Huh? You have only one Pokémon?\nI can’t trade with you unless you have two.
Do you want my Barboach? It did a great job\nat Wela Volcano. I don’t mind trading it\r\nfor Tentacool.
I’m so happy!\c\nI’ll take good care of your Tentacool, so please\ntake good care of my Barboach!
Ten, ten, ten, ten, Tentacool. ♪\nWhat I want is Tentacool!
See you!
Barboach’s types are Water and Ground!\nGrass is its only weakness!
I heard that you can’t trade unless you have\ntwo Pokémon!
Please trade my Arbok for your Trumbeak!
Bye-bye, Arbok.\nCome on, Trumbeak.
Argh! I told you that I want Trumbeak!
OK.\nMaybe next time.
Please give lots of love to my Arbok!\c\nI’ll take good care of your Trumbeak and make it\nevolve into Toucannon!
Wherever you are, the rule is the same.\c\nYou can’t trade unless you have at least\ntwo Pokémon!
Hey. Do you have Phantump?\nTrade it for my Phantump if you have one.\c\nI know. You must be wondering why I want to\ntrade the same species of Pokémon.\c\nI want to see if the rumor about it is true.
Phantump...\c\nI heard they were created when spirits\npossessed rotten tree stumps...
No, no, no! I have something I want to find out\nby trading Phantump for Phantump!
I’ll be waiting!
Whoa! Phantump evolved!\nSo the rumor was true!
Wahaha! Don’t be ridiculous! You can’t trade\nwhen you have only one Pokémon in your party!
Do you wan’ a Shellos?\nI wan’ a Granbull.
Thanks.\c\nI’ll be good to your Granbull, so be nice to\nmy Shellos.
Didn’t I tell you that I want Granbull?
It’s not that easy to say good-bye to your\nPokémon...\c\nIf you change your mind, come see me.
Shellos look different based on their forms—\nWest Sea and East Sea.\r\nBut where’s the border?
Oh? If you want to trade, at least two Pokémon\nshould be with you.
My Tauros intimidates its opponent with its\nIntimidate Ability!\c\nLet’s trade Pokémon!\nLet’s see. I want Bewear!
Both your Bewear and my Tauros will have\na new journey!
Hey! What I want is Bewear!
Oh well, if you change your mind, trade Pokémon\nwith me, all right?
I’ll conquer the Battle Tree with this Bewear!\c\nYou, too, get ahead with that Tauros!
Seriously? You can’t trade Pokémon unless you\nhave at least two Pokémon!

Do you have any Fossils on you?\nDo you wanna turn ’em back into Pokémon?
[~ 2]
Which Fossil do you want to restore back into\na Pokémon then?
All righty! You just leave it up to me!\c\nI’m gonna turn that [VAR ITEM2(0000)] of\nyours back into a Pokémon lickety-split!
What, you don’t want me to restore your Fossil?\nTch! Don’t you get how amazing this chance is?
[~ 6]
I turned that Fossil of yours right back into the\nPokémon it used to be!\c\nThis here is [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!\nYou’d better take right good care of it!
You obtained [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!

No thanks
If you want to meet mysterious Pokémon that\ndisappeared from the world long ago...\c\nThen you’ll have to find some Fossils first!\nYou do know about Fossils, right?
If you find any Fossils, you can have my pa\ntake a look at them for you.
Fossils are the remains of ancient Pokémon\nthat have been preserved in the ground.\c\nThey can be restored and brought back to life\nso we can meet those ancient Pokémon again!\c\nWhat do you think? It’s pretty amazing, right?
Wow!\nYou’re pretty amazing yourself!\c\nYou’ve found every known Fossil that can be\nrestored into a living Pokémon, haven’t you?\c\nThat is just so amazing that I think I will have to\ngive you a little reward!\c\nThis is your proof of being a Fossil Master!
Are you a Fossiphiliac, too?\nA Fossil fan, my fine [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nIf you are, you might know the answer to this...\c\nWhat did my sweet [VAR ITEM2(000A)] turn\ninto when I had it restored?\c\nIf you’d like to see for yourself, how about a\nPokémon battle?
That’s a real shame! Don’t let that refusal\nfossilize—come back and fight me anytime!
That’s right! Sweet little [VAR ITEM2(000A)]\nbecomes a fine [VAR PKNAME(000B)]!
I hope I’ll get to meet more sweet little Fossils\nsoon, not just my [VAR ITEM2(000A)]!

Hello. Do you want to use this and awaken your\nPokémon’s hidden powers?
Hidden Power changes type depending on the\nPokémon that learns it. Somehow I can tell what\r\ntype that move will be.\c\nIf you’d like, I’ll check what type of \nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden\nPower your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power,\nthe move’s type would be [VAR TYPE(0000)].
The type of this Pokémon’s Hidden Power is\n[VAR TYPE(0000)]!
If you want to know, just ask me.
I don’t think it’s possible for an Egg to use\nHidden Power.
Unfortunately, this Pokémon can’t learn\nto use Hidden Power.

Now you look ready for anything![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but even so, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTry to be careful walking through the tall grass![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 2]
[~ 3]

Still, I have to admit that I’d love to have a new\nPokémon around...\c\nWhy don’t you head up toward Iki Town and\nsee what you discover in Alola?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Mrowr.
Wha—?\nWhy have you got a Pokémon with you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0004)]
So, that Pokémon came from the kahuna?\c\nI suppose you’d better go by Iki Town and\nlet him know you got it. It’s only polite![VAR 0114(0004)]

Hey there, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hang on, I know you...\nYou’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?!\r\nYou OK? I saw you get attacked like that![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, I got a bit of help
I was scared spitless!
Looks like you did!\nThough I sure didn’t expect that, yeah...\c\nI didn’t think these little fellows would dash out\non their own to help save a stranger![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and me both, cousin!\c\nI’m looking after these Pokémon, but they\ndashed right out on their own to save you![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I guess I’m getting ahead of myself.\c\nWelcome to Alola, the Pokémon paradise!\nThat’s what I’m supposed to be saying.\r\nI’m Kukui, yeah. The Pokémon Professor.[VAR 0114(0005)]
People and Pokémon live and work together\nhere in Alola, too.\c\nDon’t you ever forget...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You can go anywhere, yeah, as long as you got\nPokémon in your corner![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wild Pokémon could be lurking in the tall grass,\nyeah, just waiting to leap out and bite you, but\r\nyou’ll be fine if you’ve got a partner of your own![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey there!\c\nHere, let me introduce the Pokémon that helped\nyou just now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
This is the Grass-type Pokémon Rowlet.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hoo!
And the Fire-type Pokémon Litten.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mrawr.
And the Water-type Pokémon Popplio.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Bwark?
Y’see, the fact of the matter is...\c\none of these Pokémon will become your first\npartner, woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh...\nMaybe that’s why they wanted to save you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Go on and choose the one you’d like to keep as\nyour partner, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 39

Why don’t you go ahead and choose the one\nyou’d like to keep as your partner, cousin?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rowlet can fly up on its enemies real quiet like,\nyeah, and catch ’em by surprise![VAR 0114(0005)]
Litten may use Fire-type moves, but it’s one\ncool cat![VAR 0114(0005)]
Popplio works hard and makes some pretty\nawesome balloons![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hoo?
Mrawr?
Bwark!
So, you wanna go with the Grass-type Pokémon\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, you wanna go with the Fire-type Pokémon\n[VAR PKNAME(0002)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, you wanna go with the Water-type Pokémon\n[VAR PKNAME(0003)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You chose [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!
[~ 11]
I know the feeling, cousin...\nI had a real hard time choosing once, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 13]
Rowlet
Litten
Popplio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 40
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So you went with [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!\nWoo, what a fine-looking team you two are![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that you can have Pokémon battles, you’re\nwhat we call a Pokémon Trainer!\c\nHere’s a Poké Ball for [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.\nIt should feel nice and cozy in there.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
All right! Then let’s get going up to Iki Town,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Woo!\r\nTime to meet the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Island Kahuna[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Island Kahuna?!
But why?!
Truth is, that partner [VAR PKNAME(0001)] of yours\nis a gift from the kahuna, not me.\c\nSo let’s go show it off and say a proper thank-\nyou, cousin. It may not be the only gift you get![VAR 0114(0005)]
In case you hadn’t heard, the kahunas are all\ncrazy-strong Pokémon Trainers.\r\nBe careful about getting into a battle with one![VAR 0114(0005)]
Iki Town is right up here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there in that\nPoké Ball I gave you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Watch it, cuz! It’s dangerous to get too close to\na Pokémon while it’s using one of its moves!
Ruff!
We can win this! We can win this!\nJust a little bit more!
Meowth, use Scratch!
Snarrrr!
Nyahhh!
You win a Pokémon battle when the other\nPokémon is all outta energy...\r\nWhen its HP hits zero, in other words!
If you happen to pick up a Potion anywhere,\nuse it on your Pokémon when it’s low on HP...\r\nand it’ll be feeling better before you know it!

Hey, hey!\c\nWhich Pokémon are you gonna choose as your\npartner? Have you decided?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hey now! Slow your Rollout there, cousin!\nYou don’t even introduce yourself first, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh yeah! I’m Hau![VAR 0114(0007)]

Fair enough.\nI guess it was just fate for you guys to meet![VAR 0114(0007)]
But you can choose one of these two, Hau![VAR 0114(0005)]

Then I’m gonna wait for you, so you better\ncome back and battle me![VAR 0114(0007)]
All right! I’m seriously gonna enjoy this![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whoa! That was awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] were both so cool![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’ve gotta have the kinda battles where\neveryone has fun.\c\nYou and your partner Pokémon, too, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Right on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You and Hau\nboth brought out the best in your partners\r\nand pulled off some spectacular moves, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Iki Town is right up those stairs.\nCome on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 11]
You should totally check out Iki Town![VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s a Trainer’s job to draw out the max power\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she can in h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser partner Pokémon, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ahaha! Just got caught up in the middle of\nsome brawling Rockruff, that’s all![VAR 0114(0008)]
Sorry, Lillie.\nWhat were you saying before?\c\nFor some reason I thought I saw\nTapu Koko flying about...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, um...\nYes, Kahuna Hala...\c\nNebby got attacked by some Spearow on the\nPlank Bridge.\c\nAnd [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here helped protect it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But the bridge collapsed, and I thought both of\nthem might fall to the bottom of the ravine...\c\nAnd that was when the island’s guardian deity\nswooped in to save them![VAR 0114(0006)]
Woo!\nThat’s something you don’t hear every day![VAR 0114(0005)]

All right, here’s a lovely gift from me to help\nmake today special, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You obtained a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
A Pokédex is a real high-tech kinda tool, yeah,\nthat can automatically record facts about any\r\nPokémon that you meet.\c\nYour new partner [VAR PKNAME(0001)] is already\nregistered, oh yeah, so check it out![VAR 0114(0005)]

You like Pokémon?
Yeah! So let’s battle!\c\nI couldn’t wait for you to find your way to\nIki Town, so I’ve been all over looking for you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Um...\c\nI don’t really like to see Pokémon battles where\nPokémon can get hurt...but I’ll watch for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh yeah, your first battle already!\c\nJust have your Pokémon dish out some moves\nand see who wins. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I appreciate you being willing to take on my\ngrandson here.\c\nI expect a no-holds-barred battle from the\nboth of you![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let me see... So we open the X Menu by tapping\n and then select Save...\c\nAnd that’s how we can save our progress to\ncontinue again at any time, right?
It’s important to save your memories!\c\nYou can save them by jotting them down so\nthat you don’t forget what you’ve done.
Didja know? When a Rockruff really likes you,\nit rubs against you with the stones on its neck!\r\nBut...it does kinda hurt...
Little Hau is a sweet one, eh?\nNothing like his fearsome granddad, Hala!
If you treat your Pokémon wrong, the guardian\ndeity will strike you down with lightning!\r\nBut the children all laugh when I tell them that.
Both sides’ Pokémon will give it their all!
Pokémon have been there for me from the\nday I was born.\c\nI’d guess that Pokémon will keep being there\nfor me my whole life!
That Hau is the kahuna’s own grandson.\c\nBoy, I might just get my hopes up for this battle.\nI hope it’ll be a good one!
The tall grass is like a treasure trove, full of\nall kinds of Pokémon just waiting to be found!
Come on, Hau!\nYou can do it! And you, too, [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!

And if your Pokémon get all tuckered out, you\ncan always head home and rest up a bit, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Here’re some Poké Balls and Potions to get you\nstarted out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Why don’t you have a little adventure of your\nown on the way to Iki Town, yeah?\c\nTake good care of [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Mooo-ar!

Hold on!\nYou gotta battle with me![VAR 0114(0007)]
You will battle me, right?\nI know you will! Right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah, and I won’t lose!
Not now!
All right! This is gonna be great![VAR 0114(0007)]
Very well, then! Let the Pokémon battle begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hoo-ee! That gave me chicken skin!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now that settles it!\nI’m going all out tomorrow![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh yeah! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHold up a sec![VAR 0114(0007)]
What is it, Hau? Did you forget something?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re seriously asking me that?!\c\nWho’s the one here who forgot to tell anyone\nbefore wandering off for a little stroll and a\r\nsing without a word, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
Hm?\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nWould you be so kind as to give me a look at\nthat [VAR COLOR(0001)]Sparkling Stone[VAR COLOR(0000)] you have there?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Could it be?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Tutu, isn’t that...[VAR 0114(0007)]
You were rescued by Tapu Koko at the bridge—\nisn’t that what I heard, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, it rescued me
That’s when I got that stone
So it even deigned to give you a stone...\c\nPerhaps you are here in Alola, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nbecause this is where you are meant to be.\c\nAllow me to borrow this stone for now.\c\nFret not! I’ll return it to you tomorrow evening.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You have the makings of a brilliant Trainer.\nI can see that light within you, too.\c\nYou must do us the honor of joining in our\nfestival tomorrow![VAR 0114(0008)]
First I’ll make sure you get back home safe\ntoday, though, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nLillie, you two should come with us, too, yeah.\c\nWouldn’t want to go losing you twice in one day.\nYou or that precious Pokémon of yours![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...\nI will keep an eye on...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Oh, you! Would you not try to escape the very\nmoment that you were told not to wander off![VAR 0114(0006)]

So this...is what they call a festival!\c\nIt does look like the people are having fun...\c\nNot that they should!\nAs though this was any time to celebrate...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You don’t have to try so hard to act like you’re\nnot interested, you know?\c\nMaybe a festival isn’t so bad sometimes.\nThe aura measurements are pretty high, too![VAR 0114(0030)]
Are they?\c\nIt is only thanks to the Blinding One that Alola\nis overflowing with such brilliance.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Though the Blinding One is left in such a state\nnow, so dark and enfeebled...[VAR 0114(0030)]
We’ve just gotta make sure the Blinding One\ncan shine like it used to again, right!\r\nSo let’s get started by having a look around![VAR 0114(0030)]
You...are likewise new to the shores of Alola.\c\nA fellow traveler from a distant land...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Measuring the aura readings here...\nthe numbers appear to be a bit high.\c\nWhat do you think, Captain?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hm?! What was what? Did you say something?\nI was...well, I was certainly not distracted by\r\nthis foolish display of festivity!\c\nSo there are aura readings in this place...\nPerhaps it may be the effects of that one\r\nthey call the island kahuna.[VAR 0114(0030)]
But everything is so bright here in Alola...\c\nFar brighter than we had been told it would be.\nI find it loathsome. This awful brightness.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Even though this is the light we have sought\nfor so long?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Y-yes, I suppose you are right.\c\nWe must carry out our investigations to return\nthe light to our own world as well.\r\nBefore the Blinding One can awaken...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You—\nYou are not native to Alola either, are you?\r\nYou seem to have come from far away...[VAR 0114(0030)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 62

The Alola region is made up of our four islands.\c\nAnd each island has its own guardian Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Our festival today is held to express our thanks\nto these great Pokémon guardian deities for\r\nalways remaining by our sides.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 2]
Well, we may call it a festival, but it’s just this\nlittle thing you see here.\c\nThere may not be many of us, but at least every\nlast one of us here goes all out.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Hoo!
Grrr!
Arf!
Hold on...\nDidn’t anyone explain to you about tonight?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh yeah, right on time![VAR 0114(0005)]
But to what exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
A full-powered festival for Pokémon battling!\c\nWe battle in the name of Tapu Koko, pitting our\nbest moves against one another in friendly\r\ncompetition to please our guardian. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, you two will be taking part in the battle?\c\nI don’t like seeing Pokémon fight one another,\nsince they so often end up getting hurt.\c\nBut...I’ll be sure to watch you both.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 11]
Your Pokémon have fought for you, so show\nthem the same care in return, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAllow me to heal them for you this time.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you ready for this Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0008)]
When you feel that you’re ready, come back\nand tell me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then let’s begin![VAR 0114(0008)]

Text File : 64

For all life on our islands...[VAR 0114(0008)]
and for those who undertake the\nisland challenge with joy in their hearts...[VAR 0114(0008)]
we pray for your protection...\nfor them and all Melemele.[VAR 0114(0008)]
May this Pokémon battle be an offering to\nour island’s guardian deity—Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0008)]
Before you stands Hau—grandson\nto the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Let’s have fun with this, [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Before him stands [VAR TRNAME(0000)]—\none who has met with Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What?!
What a curious little thing Tapu Koko is!\nHah, that’s just typical of it!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]!\nTake care of my little [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as we both have a good time,\nthen I think we can call it a great battle, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hau!\nBring forth the power of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hoo-ee! Another great battle this year.
I bet Tapu Koko liked it, too.
Phew...\nThat was awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
That was a really great battle!\nI had a blast fighting you![VAR 0114(0007)]
It was a good battle.\nWith this, even Tapu Koko...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ko-ko-kooo!
Ho! You heard it yourself!\nTapu Koko’s song of approval.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, I nearly forgot! I think it is time you take\nthis, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Your [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Power Ring[VAR COLOR(0000)], a mysterious armband that\ncan draw out the power that lies deep\r\nwithin Pokémon...\c\nIt can bring forth their [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Power[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
You slipped the Z-Power Ring onto your wrist!
We kahunas can make Z-Power Rings using\nstones like the Sparkling Stone that you\r\nreceived from Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Though you will need to undergo the island\nchallenge and collect Z-Crystals for yourself,\r\nif you wish to draw forth Pokémon’s Z-Power![VAR 0114(0008)]
And yet you have already received that\nSparkling Stone...\c\nIt seems Tapu Koko took quite a liking to you...\nor perhaps it has a mission for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, it’s time for you to get out there and start\nyour [VAR COLOR(0001)]island challenge[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nIf you visit every island, maybe you’ll figure out\nwhat that mission is.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The island challenge?
Every island?
Four islands![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll travel to each of the four islands here\nin the Alola region.\c\nThe island challenge is about aiming to be the\nstrongest Trainer—\r\nthe [VAR COLOR(0001)]island challenge champion[VAR COLOR(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sounds great, right?\nI can’t wait to have a real adventure![VAR 0114(0007)]
But I’ll let Kahuna Hala explain the details![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 65
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The island challenge Kukui spoke of...\c\nIt is a journey to overcome your own limitations,\nas you travel the far corners of Alola and meet\r\nwith others along the path.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It is the great adventure that children in the\nAlola region embark upon, along with their\r\nPokémon, once they reach 11 years of age![VAR 0114(0008)]
Allow me to give you both the island challenge\namulets you will need.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Awesome!\nThanks, Tutu![VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m gonna make it through the island challenge\nto try to become an island challenge champion![VAR 0114(0007)]
There is one for you as well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nPlease do give the island challenge a try.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, doing the island challenge is the best way\nto really get to know Alola![VAR 0114(0005)]

That was a most mysterious event...\c\nA festival to celebrate drawing forth one’s\nfull power...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You looked like you were enjoying the show.\nDid you want to take part in the battles, too?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Don’t be silly...\nWe are here to investigate and learn.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Even with all of our technology, we cannot\ncontrol the Blinding One’s light...\c\nThus we are left with no choice but to try to\nstop it by force!\c\nAnd yet it seems that the humans of this Alola\ncan wield powerful auras.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Yeah, what’d they call that thing?\nA Z-Power Ring?\r\nIts aura readings were off the chart!\c\nDo you think that’s why they can control auras\nlike that?\c\nAlola is definitely an amazing place!\nLet’s go check the next site![VAR 0114(0030)]
Captain...\c\nI was able to detect high levels of aura at this\nfull-powered festival.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I suppose you would...\c\nAccording to our earlier research it seems that\nthe Z-Power Ring and this Tapu Koko creature\r\nare bathed in a great deal of light.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Alola overflows with the light that was released\nby the Blinding One...\r\nI find myself rather envious.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I wonder if we can’t find some way to use the\ngreat power that fills Alola for ourselves...[VAR 0114(0030)]
That is precisely what we, the Ultra Recon\nSquad, are here to make clear.\c\nOnward! There is still so much of Alola we have\nnot seen, and we must investigate it all![VAR 0114(0030)]
Tapu Koko is amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI hope I can meet it again someday and thank it\nfor saving Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Me, too
Oh yeah?
It saved you as well, didn’t it?\nAnd left you with that Sparkling Stone...\r\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nit did save your life, too.\c\nAnd it even gifted you that Sparkling Stone...\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Suppose it’s time we get you kids home, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Nebby...\nAlola is full of all kinds of wonders, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Maybe it would be a good idea for you to try\nthat island challenge thing...\c\nIt’s something you can only do in Alola, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But right now I’ve got a date with my bed.\nI danced my feet off at that festival!\r\nNight-night, sweetie. You get some sleep, too![VAR 0114(0004)]

“Hey there, Lillie!\nBring me that great new Trainer. Woo!”[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I’m here to show you the way to his Pokémon\nlab, if you’ll come with me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s, um... It’s this way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Here. A little pocket money for you.\nDon’t go wasting it on anything too silly![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! Well done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou’re already making friends, aren’t you?\r\nAnd what a cute little friend you’ve found!\c\nI knew Alola would be a great place for us.\nWe just keep meeting wonderful people here![VAR 0114(0004)]
M-me? Well, thank you...\c\nMy name is Lillie.\nIt’s very nice to meet you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like it’s finally your time to shine, sweetie!\c\nEnjoy yourself out there with [VAR PKNAME(0001)].\nAnd don’t be gone too long![VAR 0114(0004)]
You...have a very nice mother, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
We should get going.\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 71

You can reach the professor’s lab by treading\nthrough the tall grass here.\c\nHe says he can research moves better when\nhe is so surrounded by Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Since I’m not a Trainer, though, I have to rely on\nusing Repels all the time.\c\nYou do know that using Repel keeps Pokémon\nfrom attacking, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
A-and about Nebby...\c\nOh. I mean...Cosmog.\c\nCosmog seems to be a very rare Pokémon.\nIt came from far, far away.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
It seems to have a very strange power...\c\nIt used that power to save me once when I was\nin danger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But some...other people want Cosmog for\nthemselves, to use that power.\c\nThat’s why only the professor and Kahuna Hala\nand other people I can trust know about it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Can you keep a secret?\c\nCan you not tell anyone else about Nebby\nor what happened on that bridge? Please...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nDo you want to know something neat?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You can reach the Pokémon Research Lab\nwithout having to go through any patches of\r\ntall grass if you jump down from this ledge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Just like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hyup![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’d like to take a shortcut, I suggest you\ntry it, too.\c\nI’ll be heading to the lab now, so see you there![VAR 0114(0006)]
Not that way![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 72
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ahh...\nThere they go again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
The Pokémon Research Lab has its own unique\ncharm, as I think you might agree.\c\nI’ve actually been, um, imposing on the\nprofessor here for the past three months.\c\nI’m not much of an assistant, but it’s the least\nI can do to pay him back for letting me stay.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe I’d be more help if I were a real Pokémon\nTrainer, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Raaaa-oooooohhh! Raff ruff!
Oh yeah, Rockruff! Let’s go!\nGive it everything you’ve got!\r\nMy body is ready. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor...\c\nHe never stops researching moves.\nNot even...inside the lab itself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like we’ll have to patch the roof again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I had just washed his lab coat and finally\ngotten it clean, too. Now it’ll be in shreds...\r\nand I’m no good at mending clothes...\r\nso he’ll just have to buy another new one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
We should probably go in before he does\nany more damage...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Of course. However I can be a help...\nI am supposed to be your assistant, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Rockruff’s moves were just so stylin’, and I was\nmaking good progress with my research.\c\nSay, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], lemme see your Pokédex\nfor a second, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what do you think of the place?\nNot bad, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But that’s not why I called you here, eh?\nHere! It finally arrived![VAR 0114(0005)]
“It”...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s wrong, Lillie? Don’t make me do all\nthe talking![VAR 0114(0005)]
See, there’s this Pokémon inside your Pokédex\ncalled Rotom...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Really?
Rotom?
Oh, I can tell you about Rotom.\c\nIt is a peculiar Pokémon, with a body made up\nof something like electricity.\r\nIt can take up residence in machines.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, buddy! And to put that crazy skill of\nRotom’s to work...
It’s the next generation of Pokédexes, but it’s\nonly complete once Rotom has gone into this\r\nbody specially developed for it!
A whole new way for people and Pokémon\nto communicate. Woo!\c\nAnd there’s only a few of these beauties out in\nthe world so far!
And now if I power up your Pokédex with the\nparts that I just got in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
...Kzzzt?
Hey now! Sorry ’bout that, Rotom.\nGuess I surprised you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Zz-zzt...
Rotom!\c\nHere, boy! I powered up your favorite ’Dex!\c\nGive [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here a Helping\nHand, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kzzzt...
Check it out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nNow Rotom can talk right to you!\c\nIt may take it a little while to get used to its\nnew job, but I’d say Rotom’s taken a liking\r\nto you![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 21]
And this will help how exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] hasn’t been here in Alola too\nlong yet.\c\nSo I decided to give h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer this special Rotom Dex\nto help h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer navigate around.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you very much
Nice to meet you, Rotom!
You can see where you’re headed just by\nlooking at Rotom, and if you give it a little tap,\r\nyou can even check out the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Town Map[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whoa-ho-ho![VAR 0114(0007)]
Is that a loft?! That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
No, it’s not! It’s private!\c\nThe professor has been kind enough to let me\nuse it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you see a person or a Pokémon\nwho needs help, you just help them...\r\nRight, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And that’s why I’m letting Lillie stay up there\nin the loft.[VAR 0114(0005)]

To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotta learn the basics of being a\nPokémon Trainer through Pokémon battling.\c\nIt’s a long road to becoming the island challenge\nchampion, and the Trainers’ School is the\r\nfirst step![VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]

And then there’s the way that you and\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] both chose one another.\r\nAnd now with Rotom helping you out as well...\c\nEven Nebby likes you! I guess there’s something\nabout you that makes Pokémon feel comfortable\r\nwhen they’re by your side.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Lillie!\nYou take care of [VAR TRNAME(0000)], yeah?\c\nUntil [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she gets used to Rotom, help h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer find h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser\nway around![VAR 0114(0005)]

Nebby...\nDon’t worry—it’s OK.[VAR 0114(0006)]
This must be what they call a solar eclipse.\nIt happens when the sun gets covered up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
This must be what they call a lunar eclipse.\nIt happens when the moon gets covered up.[VAR 0114(0006)]

An omen?\nYou think something good will happen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure! A long, long time ago, Alola was cloaked in\ndarkness, yeah...\c\nBut people say that’s when Alola’s people and\nPokémon blasted all that darkness away\r\nwith light!\c\nAnd they also say that was why people started\ngathering Z-Crystals, and that custom turned\r\ninto the island challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nNow that you’ve got that Z-Power Ring, I hope\nyou’ll collect tons of Z-Crystals! Woo!\c\nThat’s exactly what a move researcher like me\nneeds to uncover new secrets![VAR 0114(0005)]
Professor, that’s not why [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s supposed to be\ndoing it...\c\nCome on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Center.[VAR 0114(0006)]

If you talk to the woman at the counter, she can\nrestore your Pokémon to perfect health.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI can’t stand seeing Pokémon in pain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You can also deposit Pokémon in the PC here\nor take them out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And at the Poké Mart you can buy all kinds of\nitems that should help you during your trials.\c\nI’d take a look, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Over there is the café area.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I like to relax there sometimes with a frosty\nglass of Moomoo Milk.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I read something in a travel guide about\nAlola once...\c\nApparently each Pokémon Center in Alola offers\na different selection of drinks.\r\nI wonder how they pick what to serve?[VAR 0114(0006)]
The cafés may also offer more than just drinks.\c\nI’ve heard they also sell special treats and that\nsometimes the staff have tips for trial-goers.[VAR 0114(0006)]

We should head to the Trainers’ School next.\c\nBut have your Pokémon taken care of first if\nyou think that they need a little aid.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI must’ve passed you two somehow, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But welcome to the Trainers’ School, the place\nto learn how to be a Pokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
[~ 3]
Professor Kukui!\nIs this the child you told me about?
Yeah. [VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s a real tough one, too.\nPut h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer through the wringer good, Teach![VAR 0114(0005)]
Four Trainers![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to beat four Pokémon Trainers here\nat the school, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nThe experience will surely help you and your\nPokémon grow stronger, yeah.\c\nActually... Speaking of experience, why don’t\nyou take this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you keep that Exp. Share on, yeah,\nall the Pokémon on your team can get\r\nExp. Points from battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Trainers who will take part in this lesson\nmay be inside or outside the school.
You may also want to visit our classrooms.\c\nYou’ll learn things there that will help on your\njourney, I’d say.
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
All right. Let the lesson begin!
She may not look all that tough, but that teach\ntrains her kids right!\r\nOne of her students is even a captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you want a bit of advice from me, here’s\nsomething that might help.\c\nOnce you’ve fought a species of Pokémon once,\nyou can easily see what types of moves will\r\nwork best on it in your next battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wandering about in the tall grass to meet\nlots of different Pokémon’ll help with that!\r\nBattle all the time, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache.\c\nYou can come talk to me anytime that you want\nyour team’s health restored. I’m happy to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let me take care of poor [VAR PKNAME(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]

[~ 3]
I’ll give you some Oran Berries, too!\nThey’re great to have your Pokémon hold!
Metapod looks so cute munching down an Oran\nBerry in the middle of battle!
[~ 6]
You can tell me anytime that you want your\nteam’s health restored, and I’ll help you.\c\nSeeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll show you my Grimer’s best move!\nWith Poison Gas, it’ll poison everyone that\r\ncomes at us!
Grass-type Pokémon are immune to powder\nmoves, like Poison Powder and Sleep Powder.\c\nBut you can still poison ’em with Poison Gas!
If my precious Bonsly takes damage in a\nPokémon battle, I’ll want to use a Potion on it!
You can help your Pokémon win by using items\nat the right time.\c\nThey can do more than just healing your\nPokémon’s HP, too. You can even boost their\r\nstats and things like that.
You wanna know why I’m standing here?\nBecause I’m the strongest, that’s why!\c\nI won’t even bother battling you unless you can\nbeat everyone else here!
Looks like you beat everybody else, huh?\c\nBut don’t think you’ll beat me the same way!\nEkans’s Ability is gonna get you!
Intimidate is an Ability that lowers your\nopponent’s Attack stat.\c\nIf you understand your Pokémon’s Abilities,\nyou can use the best strategies in battle.
But fine! Whatever!\c\nI can admit it when I’m beat.\nI’ll give you a reward even.\r\nTake this Technical Machine!
OK. First thing to know about TMs.\c\nTechnical Machines teach new techniques.\nThey’ll give your Pokémon a new move in a flash.\c\nBut if your Pokémon can’t learn the move in a\nTM, then too bad. You are up the creek, pal.\c\nSecond thing to know about TMs.\c\nYou can use a TM as many times as you want,\non as many different Pokémon as you want.\c\nThey don’t wear out or get used up.\nPretty nice gift from me, huh?
Oh, that’s the school bell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Attention, all students...\c\nWould [VAR TRNAME(0000)] please come to the\noffice on 2F?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] to the 2F office, please.
What terrible thing did you do to get called to\nthe office so soon?[VAR 0114(0006)]

After seeing such a performance, I think I’d like\nto battle you myself!\c\nWhat do you say?\nAre you ready to take me on?
Good. I heard about you from Professor Kukui.\c\nI’ll be challenging you with a Pokémon that has\na type advantage against that [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\r\nyou chose for your partner!
You must be joking!\c\nYou do know how much experience you could\ngain from battling me, right?
Nice! Maybe you’d like to take over as teacher\nhere for me!
All joking aside, though, I do want you to take\nthese from me...\c\nIt’s a little reward for beating me.
They’re Great Balls. Great Balls are better at\ncatching Pokémon than normal Poké Balls.
Know your Pokémon and know their moves.\nThose are the basics of being a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]

Where will you try petting Tauros?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Pet its face
Stroke its mane
Grab it by the tail
Hrmmm. That doesn’t seem to have impressed\nTauros very much.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Bwoh!
Ha ha ha! You see that? This rascal already\nloves you!\c\nPokémon become happier when we show them\nsome [VAR COLOR(0001)]care[VAR COLOR(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Wa ha ha! Oh the places you’ll go, child!\c\nAnd as you do, you will surely meet more\nPokémon and people who will enrich your life.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The kahunas sure are something, eh?\nAble to calm a raging Pokémon without even\r\nneeding to battle... Now that’s something!\c\nI mean, I like Tauros plenty and all...\c\nbut it is pretty scary! I don’t want to ride on it![VAR 0114(0007)]
So where are you two off to now?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Then what’re we waiting for!\nThis way! Come on![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, Hau...\c\nI guess we should go catch up with him before\nhe gets too far, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nHau’oli City is the biggest city in all Alola.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Isn’t that awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou got a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0007)]

Pew!
I read something in an old book once. It said \nthat the island challenges were once a journey\r\nmade to prove yourself and gain the strength to\r\nbattle against the guardian deities of Alola.\c\nLike Tapu Koko...\c\nThe people in Iki Town said that Tapu Koko\nloves Pokémon battles, didn’t they?[VAR 0114(0006)]
If we could meet Tapu Koko once more, do you\nthink we would find the answer to why it saved\r\nyou and Nebby that day, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
Oh yes... Please take these.\nThey are called Revives.\c\nIf you use one on a Pokémon that has fainted,\nit will recover and feel a little better.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nGood luck on your first trial.\nI will hope that it goes well for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Howzit, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIf you’re looking for good eats, you’ve found ’em![VAR 0114(0007)]
Plus, malasadas make your Pokémon like you.\nAnd affectionate Pokémon are better in battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who could resist giving their Pokémon a few\nmalasadas, eh? They’re just so cute![VAR 0114(0007)]
Yo, yo, yo, check it!\c\nWhenever, wherever we meet you,\nTeam Skull don’t even greet you![VAR 0114(0030)]
Yo, you wanna throw us a bone and hand over\nthose island challenge amulets to us now?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Ohhh. So you’re part of that Team Skull, huh?\c\nAll you guys ever do is steal Totem Stickers\nand people’s Pokémon and get in the way\r\nof other people’s island challenges![VAR 0114(0007)]
You know it!\c\nWe hate the island challenge, yo!\nAnd every kid fool enough to try it![VAR 0114(0031)]

Yo, check how I change the game with my mad\nPokémon skills![VAR 0114(0032)]
No fair! I was playing a different game![VAR 0114(0032)]
Stupid kahuna’s grandson or whatever! We’re\nnot a fan of you![VAR 0114(0031)]
Let’s get up out this port, B! Nobody has to\nknow about this!\c\nWe don’t need your wack little amulets anyway!\nWouldn’t even take ’em if you gave ’em to us![VAR 0114(0031)]
Those Team Skull jerks really must have too\nmuch time on their hands, yeah?\c\nBut keeping other people from doing their\nisland challenges isn’t gonna just make it like\r\nthey managed to finish theirs, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I already went down to the Marina and\nscreamed out over the ocean, “Watch out, world!\r\nSomeday I’m gonna beat even my old\r\ngramps in an all-out serious battle!”\c\nSo maybe I’ll go try to find some more Totem\nStickers next. See you around![VAR 0114(0007)]

My Crabrawler sure is something, ain’t he?\c\nHe nabs passersby to bring them to me,\nso I can send them down by the bay!
[~ 2]
Though he’s actually been a little too good at\nhis job, so I’ve got no vacant rooms to offer you.\c\nBut that doesn’t mean you’ve come for nothing!
Here, follow me this way.
See that! Look at that broad expanse of beach!\nIts name is Big Wave Beach.\c\nThere are some interesting Pokémon to be found\ndown on the beach, so I’d suggest having a look.
And, just so you know, the path to the beach\nwas made by none other than yours truly.\r\nThat’s right, just me and my Crabrawler!

Hey, little cousin! Welcome to Big Wave Beach!\c\nYou’ve come to exactly the right place if you’re\nlooking for some Mantine Surf!
Mantine Surf is just what it says on the box.\nYou climb up on the back of our Mantine...\r\nand then you surf!\c\nSurfing is the best sport, where you can enjoy\ntraveling across the ocean waves!
Though youngsters like yourself who want to\nget into Mantine Surf have to toughen up\r\nand show that they can really handle it first.\c\nSurfing is a bit of a dangerous sport, to be fair.
Come back when you’re as tough as a real\nkahuna, OK?\c\nMe and Mantine will be holding our breath in\nanticipation till you do!\c\nWait, do Mantine breathe?\nCan they even hold their breath?

What’s up with that?! We look like kids to you\nor somethin’?![VAR 0114(0032)]
No. The real reason is...

Every time you try, you keep up those ridiculous\ndance moves even on Mantine’s back.\r\nAnd then you end up in the water.
You want us to stop dancing?! That’s our\nidentity, yo! It’s all we’ve got![VAR 0114(0032)]
Man, forget her, B![VAR 0114(0031)]
We’re Team Skull! No one can stop us from\nacting hardheaded![VAR 0114(0032)]
Somebody! Please help keep these numskulls\naway from Mantine!
What’re you looking at, short stuff?\nHuh? Huh... Wait, huh?!\c\nYou’re that kid![VAR 0114(0031)]
You wanna scrap, tiny Trainer? A battle, yo?\c\nYou might’ve beat us in Hau’oli City, but we’ll\nput our heads together to beat you this time![VAR 0114(0032)]
Seriously, home slice?!\nYou’re too strong for a kid, yo!\c\nArgh! I’ve gotta go make someone else miserable\nto feel better!\c\nLet’s go mess with Ilima again, B![VAR 0114(0032)]

Nice one, kid! Mantine won’t be subjected to\ntheir terrible surfing skills thanks to you!\c\nYou’re a decent Trainer. Just like I’d expect\nfrom a trial-goer on the island challenge!\r\nWhy don’t you take this from me?
I bet you could take on Captain Ilima’s trial\nwith how well you handled that battle.\r\nEven Kahuna Hala would probably say you’re\r\nready to take on all of Alola!\c\nIf he says that you’re ready, come back here\nand we’ll get you up on Mantine in no time!
Meet lots of different Pokémon on your journey!\c\nThat’s how I became friends with Mantine here,\nback in the days of my own island challenge.

No... It seems that people are not allowed within\nthis Verdant Cavern without specific reason.\c\nWe should ask the president to arrange for\nsome special accommodations on our behalf.\c\nWe don’t yet have the means to capture\nPokémon on our own, after all.[VAR 0114(0030)]

Wow!\nA Z-Crystal![VAR 0114(0030)]
So that is what they call a Z-Crystal!\c\nIt appears that Alola’s mysterious Z-Crystals\nare received for overcoming trials, is that right?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I suppose it may be admirable to overcome such\ntrials using your own strength and skill...\r\nrather than relying on technology, as we do.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m Zossie!\nYou’re kind of awesome, you know?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Ah. This is when you are supposed to say\n“Alola” to one another, is it not?\c\nI am Dulse.[VAR 0114(0036)]
And we’re part of the Ultra Recon Squad, yup!\c\nThat ball thing you used there...\nThat is some amazing bit of tech!\r\nWe might just have to borrow that idea![VAR 0114(0037)]
We’re investigating all about Z-Crystals and\nauras and all kinds of stuff.\r\nSo I guess we’ll probably see you around![VAR 0114(0037)]

The people of Alola overcome these trials\nwillingly to obtain this mysterious power...\r\nto gain access to Z-Power. Is that it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Depending on no one and nothing but yourself...\nThat is a fine aspiration.\c\nQuite different from our tendency to use our\ntechnology to solve all of our problems.[VAR 0114(0030)]
It is a pleasure to meet you.\nMy name is Soliera.[VAR 0114(0038)]

We are investigating the Z-Crystals found here\nin Alola for our own particular reasons.\c\nAnd I also find those Poké Balls that you use to\nbe most intriguing...[VAR 0114(0038)]

Revives are solid items to have!\nIf your Pokémon faints in battle and can’t go on,\r\nthen a Revive will perk ’em right back up!\c\nBut you probably won’t find Revives here.\nDidja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell\r\ndifferent things?

[~ 3]
Note that the Pokémon living within Verdant\nCavern are quite fierce.\c\nI wouldn’t venture in unless you’ve prepared\nsome Potions and so forth.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Through attempting the trials during the island\nchallenge, one can exceed his or her own limits.\r\n...That is what the Alolan people believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Once you enter Verdant Cavern, you will not be\nable to leave until you have completed the trial.\r\nAre you prepared for the trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll be waiting for you![VAR 0114(000C)]

What you should attempt to do is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk\nhere in their dens![VAR 0114(000C)]
Then reach the pedestal deep within the cave...\c\nand collect the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Crystal[VAR COLOR(0000)] there![VAR 0114(000C)]
You’ll need to be completely in sync with your\nPokémon to succeed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Grrrr!
Oh dear!\c\nAnd there’s one more thing I forgot to mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Many strong Pokémon make their home in this\ncave, but one stronger and more fearsome\r\nthan all the rest, known as a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Totem Pokémon[VAR COLOR(0000)],\r\nalso resides here!\c\nIt will be the greatest obstacle you face as you\nattempt to clear my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
By the way, until you clear the trial, you will not \nbe able to catch Pokémon in Verdant Cavern.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is but one of the eight trials you will face\nduring your island challenge. [VAR 0114(000C)]
And it begins now! The trial of Captain Ilima![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let the Verdant Cavern trial of Ilima...begin!
Not sure what to do?\nIt’s quite simple.\c\nDefeat the three Pokémon, reach the\npedestal at the back of the cave,\r\nand get the Z-Crystal.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now all you need do is claim the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ki-ki-ki-kiii!
The Totem [VAR PKNAME(0002)] is a formidable\nopponent for any Trainer to take on.\c\nIt is a Normal-type Pokémon, so perhaps you\nshould battle back with Fighting-type\r\nPokémon or moves![VAR 0114(000C)]

Yo, you think maybe all these dens are, like,\nconnected or something?\c\nIf they are, and we park our bones right here,\nthen nobody’ll come out these holes, right?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Yo, yo, yo! Come on out!\c\nI’m gonna make you man enough...or, uh,\n’mon enough to take on that big ol’ boss inside![VAR 0114(0031)]

Ah, yes. First, there is one thing I forgot\nto mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
In every locale where a captain holds his or\nher trials, you will encounter a particularly\r\nstrong Pokémon, like [VAR PKNAME(0001)] just now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And during battles against such Pokémon, they\nmay [VAR COLOR(0001)]summon allies [VAR COLOR(0000)]to shore up their offense.\c\nIt’s not a tactic often seen in other regions.\c\nPerhaps Pokémon in Alola are simply more\ninclined to help one another?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Since you have managed to defeat the\nTotem Pokémon and proved yourself, you can\r\nnow try to catch any of the Pokémon you find\r\nhere in this cave.\c\nIn fact, have some Great Balls.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And here, let me see to your Pokémon after all\nof their hard work in there![VAR 0114(000C)]

Are you ready?\c\nThen behold the power of a captain![VAR 0114(000C)]
Voila!\nYour world just got a little bigger.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I am the only captain here on Melemele Island,\nmeaning my trial is the only one here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that you have cleared the trial, please\ninform our island kahuna, Hala![VAR 0114(000C)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nOooh, looking at the expression on Ilima’s face,\nI’d say you cleared your first trial, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess I better give you a little reward...\nTime to learn about [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Power[VAR COLOR(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Watch and learn, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
Phew! Z-Powers heap all of a Trainer’s feelings\nonto a Pokémon, yeah,\r\nwhich totally wears you out!\c\nUsing Z-Power once per battle\nis all a team can handle, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, so is that why you’ve been looking so\nragged, Professor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No! It’s like I was hit with Amnesia!\c\nI forgot that I lost Lillie somewhere on Route 3!\c\nThink you could spare some time to help me look\nfor her, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I can also look around where I think she might\nhave wandered off to.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thanks, cousin.\nLet’s split up and find her, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

Nebby!\nNebby, come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nebby...\c\nIt got out of my bag again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But why would it want to go in that cave...?\c\nAnd right after it got into so much trouble\non the bridge, too...\c\nWhat if a wild Pokémon attacks it?\nIt doesn’t have any moves it can use to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nLet me heal your Pokémon for you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I always carry lots of Potions on me to keep\nNebby healthy.\c\nThat’s the best I can do, since I’m not a real\nTrainer or anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Oh, you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I should thank [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.\nHere, let me at least do this...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, I read something interesting in a\nbook once...\c\nIt seems the Pokémon called Oricorio changes\nappearance by feeding on the nectar from\r\ndifferent types of flowers.\c\nIt’s not actually evolving but undergoing a\nso-called “form change.”\c\nIsn’t that interesting? I thought it was, anyway...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Back into the bag, please, Nebby.\c\nI know there aren’t many people around to see\nyou here, but that’s hardly an excuse!\c\nAnd I guess we should be going now...\c\nThe professor will probably be worried after\nthe way we just disappeared on him...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Text File : 123

Pew!
Phew...\nRunning around like this sure is tiring!\c\nWhoa! So the people of Alola meet in places\nlike this, too, huh?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Calm yourself, Zossie.\nThere is only one thing we are here to confirm.\c\nWe must find someone strong enough to protect\nthe Blinding One.\r\nLet us see if you might be the one![VAR 0114(0036)]
I see...\nSo that is a Pokémon battle...\c\nWe had tried to investigate what it meant to\nbattle with Pokémon, but it is quite different\r\nwhen you do it yourself.\c\nAt least it seems that the Poké Ball we tried to\ncreate has worked properly to capture us a\r\nPokémon here in Alola.\c\nAnd I have seen for myself how strong you are,\nyoung Alolan Trainer.[VAR 0114(0036)]
So, Dulse, what’re we gonna do?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Trainer, you should know that this one here\nwarps away if it is threatened in any way...\c\nAnd the holes that are torn open as a result\ninvite dangerous beings into this world.\c\nBut perhaps things will be all right as long as\nthere are Trainers like you in Alola...[VAR 0114(0036)]
What about that [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0600)]other girl, though?[VAR 0114(0037)]
That girl should have nothing to do with our\ninvestigations, nor this Pokémon of hers...\r\nas long as no one is foolish enough to open a\r\npath that could lead here from Megalo Tower.\c\nLet us carry on, Zossie.[VAR 0114(0036)]
An elusive target, indeed...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Hmm. Soliera.\nTest this one.\c\nI would also like to check the functionality of\nthat Poké Ball we tried making in the image of\r\nthe devices used by these Alolan people.\c\nNow that we have at least succeeded in using\none to capture an Alolan Pokémon specimen.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Yes, sir.\nI will do so at once.[VAR 0114(0038)]
I see...\nSo that is what a Pokémon battle is!\c\nI suppose if there are strong Trainers like\nyourself around, we may not need to play any\r\ngreat role in this endeavor.[VAR 0114(0039)]
So then we do not need to bother with the\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0600)]other girl, I assume...[VAR 0114(0038)]
That one you have come to collect...\c\nYou must know that it is able to warp away in\nan instant when threatened.\c\nYou should remember, though, that the holes\nthat are created when it does so leave a path\r\nopen to dangerous beings.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Pew?

Start off by selecting a compatible Z-Crystal\nfrom the Z-Crystals Pocket in your Bag, yeah!
Then use the Z-Crystal you chose\non a Pokémon!
Z-Crystals are [VAR COLOR(0001)]compatible [VAR COLOR(0000)]with a Pokémon if it\nknows a move of the same type as the crystal.
Have your Pokémon hold Z-Crystals, and you’ll\nbe able to use Z-Power in battles!
And don’t worry, you can use your Z-Crystals\nover and over on as many Pokémon as you want!

He-e-ey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nOh! And Lillie’s with you, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
What are you up to, Hau?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Just finished up my trial! Heh![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI wanna see if I really learned anything from my\ntrial. Let me battle you again![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you and me both beat that Totem Pokémon,\nhuh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nLooks like we’re getting pretty strong!\c\nAnd I’m not stopping now. I’m gonna use\nthis momentum to beat my old gramps, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nKnew I could count on you, yeah!\c\nThanks for tracking Lillie down for me![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’s this then?\nHau, you finished your first trial, too?\r\nI bet you used some stylin’ moves, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh heh, yeah...\nAll thanks to [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hala’s probably rubbing his hands together in\nglee right about now, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s all a part of the trials, yeah?\c\nAfter you clear one island’s trials, you gotta\nbattle that island’s kahuna![VAR 0114(0007)]
Taking on the island kahuna in battle is called\nthe [VAR COLOR(0001)]grand trial[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nFor someone like me who’s researching Pokémon\nmoves, nothing could be better than the chance\r\nto see some more fierce Pokémon battles! Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know about fierce...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll be the judge of that!\nCome on! Back to Iki Town!\c\nCatch that Tailwind and blast through Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s true... I’m not a Trainer, so I’m sure I don’t\nreally understand how hard it must have been...\r\nbut even I think it’s a great achievement.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Yes, yes... We all know how you feel!\nBut stay inside your bag, please![VAR 0114(0006)]
The Melemele kahuna is strong, cousin!\c\nHe’s a Trainer who can use [VAR COLOR(0001)]Fighting-type[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nPokémon to the fullest, yeah.\c\nMight not be a bad idea to work on those\nFlying- or Psychic-type moves![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ho![VAR 0114(0008)]
I have been expecting you.\c\nAllow me to properly greet the young\nadventurers embarking on their island challenge.\c\nI am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Shall we begin?\c\nThe final trial here on Melemele Island will be a\nPokémon battle against me, the kahuna!\c\nIt is known as the grand trial![VAR 0114(0008)]
Your spirit appears to be ready! However, your\nPokémon must also be healthy if they are to\r\nunleash their full power in battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes! It seems that both you and your Pokémon\nare prepared to combine your mental and\r\nphysical strengths to unleash your full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the\nSparkling Stone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the Sparkling\nStone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] and your team’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
Old Hala here will also be going all out!\nLet the grand trial begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
...Hmmph![VAR 0114(0008)]
The results come as no surprise to me.\c\nWhat a fine Trainer...and what fine Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
Tapu Ko-ko-ko!
Ho! And our mighty Tapu Koko agrees![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmmph! Perhaps Tapu Koko is hoping that a\nday may come when you will grow strong\r\nenough to battle it as well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Accept this Z-Crystal! It allows Trainers to\nshare their power with their partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
Observe, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIf you wish to use the Fighting-type Z-Power,\nmove your arm like this...\r\nthen bend your hips like this and pose![VAR 0114(0008)]
Now then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWith this victory...\c\nyou have cleared all of the trials of Melemele\nIsland, the first of Alola’s islands!\c\nThe Melemele stamp is proof of\nyour accomplishments. With it, Pokémon up to\r\nLv. 35, even those you received in a trade,\r\nwill obey you![VAR 0114(0008)]
The moon in the daytime...\nThe sun at night...\c\nNow to see if you can pour your heart into\nsomething that cannot be seen but is very\r\nmuch real.\c\nAs you continue on your island challenge,\nconsider what makes up the people and\r\nPokémon that you meet: both what you\r\ncan see and what you cannot.\c\nYou will surely meet Tapu Koko again someday.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Moo-raaarrr!
I’ll take care of all the little things you’ll need in\norder to ride a Pokémon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
You obtained a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Ride Pager[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Why don’t you hop on there?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The world looks a bit different from atop a\nmighty Tauros, eh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
See, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nHere in Alola our Pokémon lend us their strength\nand let us ride about on them![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let me explain some of the gear I gave you...\c\nYour Ride Pager is a tool that lets you summon\na Ride Pokémon.\c\nAccording to the instructions, you need only \n“press the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Y Button[VAR COLOR(0000)] to turn on your\r\nRide Pager! Use the B Button to dash!”[VAR 0114(0008)]
And your Riding Wear will be the special outfit\nyou wear when riding Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Have a little romp around Alola with Tauros\nhere. I’m sure you’ll be charmed by him![VAR 0114(0008)]
When you use your Ride Pager, Ride Pokémon\nwill kindly come running to help you wherever\r\nyou may be![VAR 0114(0008)]

Aren’t Z-Powers lovely?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m amazed that you won without\neven using your Z-Power.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, I know! Why not stop by the Alola Photo\nClub for a commemorative photo?\c\nWith Tauros, you can be down to Hau’oli City\nin no time at all.[VAR 0114(000C)]

All right! I got a little something for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
False Swipe is a move that will leave your\nopponent with 1 HP when you attack.\c\nKeep on catching more and more Pokémon,\nyeah, and let Rotom learn all about ’em![VAR 0114(0005)]
But first, you’ve gotta go let your mom know\nwhat you’re up to.\c\nWhen you’re done with that, head on down to\nthe Marina in Hau’oli City. Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh! If you’re heading into Hau’oli, you should\ntotally check out the Shopping Mall!\r\nAnd the Alola Photo Club, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
You know! The one Ilima mentioned!\nHe totally had the right idea.\c\nYou should go to the Alola Photo Club and take\na special photo to remember clearing your first\r\ngrand trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
Good thinking, Hau!\c\nAnd once you finish your grand trial, you’ll be\ndoing the same thing, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh heh! I sure hope so, but first...\c\nCome on, Tutu!\nDon’t go too easy on me now![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re all getting so strong already, yeah...\nI can’t wait to see how much more you’ll grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, time to get the boat ready.\nLillie, you gonna help me clean it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess I am...\nSo I suppose we’ll see you later in Hau’oli City.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Um...\c\nI actually wanted to ask a favor of you first,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. If that’s all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure!
What is it?
You see...\nNebby is...\c\nIts real home is far away from here.\nAnd I want to help it get home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s like I told you before...\nNebby saved my life once when I was in trouble.\c\nNow I want to save it![VAR 0114(0006)]
I feel like there’s not much I can do on my own,\nsince I’m not a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nBut if I had a real Trainer like you helping me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], then maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I probably shouldn’t ask a near stranger to\nhelp, right?\c\nI know it’s just my own wish and it has nothing\nto do with you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course I’ll help!
Yeah, I don’t know...
Oh, thank you so much. I’m so glad!\nI really didn’t know what else to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
Then I suppose...\c\nThe two of us will be heading to the next island\nas well![VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
I...I understand.\c\nUm, but if you ever do learn anything that you\nthink might help Nebby get home...\r\nI’d really appreciate it if you could tell me.\c\nI’ll do my best to look for clues on the next\nisland on my own.\c\nAnd maybe I’ll see you there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
[~ 28]
[~ 29]
[~ 30]
You will grow even stronger from now on!\c\nAfter all, you have true partners who you can\nrely on as you walk your path together![VAR 0114(0008)]
If you could beat my gramps, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nthen there’s no way I can lose this battle![VAR 0114(0007)]

Oh! Hello, Trainer!\nLooks like you’ve got a Z-Power Ring.
Here at the Alola Photo Club, you can take\nphotos with your favorite Pokémon as you\r\nstrike your favorite poses!
You should definitely give it a try.\nAfter all, you came this far already!
Oh? Don’t give up on me now!\nWe haven’t even taken your photo yet!\c\nAre you sure you want to quit?
Yeah, let’s at least take one snapshot to\ncommemorate all you’ve done on Melemele!
Well, come back anytime that you get the\nchance and we can take your photo then.\c\nI’ll give you a little something special so you\ncan check out your photos anytime, too!
Oooh!\nI like your photo!\c\nI’ll give you a little something special so you\ncan check out your photos anytime, too!
You got a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Photo Album[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Once you’ve taken a picture, you can also\ndecorate it with special decorations, too.\r\nIt really adds some pizzazz, so give it a try!
And as you visit more places, Rotom will help\nyou out with capturing more backgrounds that\r\nyou can use when you are taking photos, too!\c\nDefinitely come to take more photos as you\nexplore the islands during your island challenge!
Open up your Photo Album from the X menu,\nwhich you can open just by pressing !
Once you open your Photo Album, you can\ndecorate your photos with stickers and more.
Add some pizzazz to really make them shine!
If you choose to share your jazzed up photos\nfrom your Photo Album...
Then everyone who comes to play in your\nFestival Plaza can see them, too!
Would you like to move right ahead to placing\nsome stickers on any photos you took?
Are your photos all simply amazing now?
If you want to decorate any photos later, you\ncan always add stickers from your Photo Album!
Then let’s open up your album...

I was thinking that I’d really like to head to\nAkala Island with Mantine!\c\nAnd I want to see [VAR TRNAME(0000)] take a shot\nat Mantine Surfing, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mantine?
But the boat?
Shoots, yeah! The Mantine from Big Wave Beach\non Route 2. You saw them, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Aw, come on!\nI really want to ride on a Mantine! Don’t you?\c\nAnd I’m totally not just saying that because the\nprofessor’s boat is such a junk heap, either.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Right...\nWell, Hau, it’s all up to you!\c\nThe island challenge is all about journeying\ntogether with Pokémon, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIf you’re all done with catching Pokémon and\nshopping, yeah, you wanna head out with us?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s good to try new things. I’m sure Mantine Surf\nwill be another wild new experience for you!\r\nThat’s what the island challenge is all about![VAR 0114(0005)]
No sweat, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nFinish up whatever you want to do on Melemele.\c\nThough you can always come back anytime![VAR 0114(0005)]
I heard that every island has different-flavored\nmalasada! Man, I can’t wait to try ’em all![VAR 0114(0007)]

Land ahoy!\nOr land ashore? Whatever you say!\c\nAll right!\nWe made it to Akala Island![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mantine is the best![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, do you think the professor and Lillie are\nalready here, too?\c\nLet’s split up and see if we can find them in\ntown anywhere, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Welcome to Akala Island![VAR 0114(0034)]
You’ll find Totem Stickers here on Akala, too.\c\nSearch around for them and enjoy your island\nchallenge to the fullest as you try to get ’em all![VAR 0114(0034)]
Whoa! Look!\nThere’s, like, a whole mess of Pyukumuku!\c\nAwww, they look like they’re sleeping so nice\nand peaceful that I don’t want to wake them up.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Zzz...

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Hau! There you are!\nHow was your trip on those Mantine?[VAR 0114(0005)]
No prob!
No good...
That’s what I like to hear, yeah. Tackle your\nisland challenge with that same attitude![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t you worry, little cousin! I’m sure Mantine\nwants you to give it another try sometime![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, so Mantine’s even faster than that old\nboat of yours, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
The professor’s sailboat is...well...\nIt has seen better days.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Still haven’t managed to find a shirt that goes\nwith your lab coat, hmm, Kukui?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’ve told you you’re gonna scare off strangers\nlooking like that...[VAR 0114(0030)]
...Nebby. Back into the bag.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t sweat it, Lillie.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Why hello there. Nice to meet you all—I’m Olivia.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hey! Thanks for stopping by!\c\nI’m Mallow, one of the captains here![VAR 0114(000E)]
I was on my way to see who was pulling into\nport and ran into Mallow here while she was\r\nout on a delivery.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yup! My trial will be a chance for all the fine\ningredients that make up your team to shine![VAR 0114(000E)]
Especially you two!\nYour Pokémon look ready to cook with gas![VAR 0114(000E)]
And Mallow isn’t the only captain here on \nAkala Island, of course.[VAR 0114(0009)]
So? What’s your plan now?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yeah, that’s up to these kids.\nIt’s their island challenge, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...I suppose so.[VAR 0114(0009)]
OK, then.\c\nEnjoy your time on your island challenge, kids,\nalong with your Pokémon.\c\nI’ll be waiting for my chance to face you\nin battle when the time comes.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve got![VAR 0114(0009)]
Let’s go, Mallow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m sure she wanted to come see that you made\nit here all right...\c\nBut she’ll never admit it to you! Hah!\c\nThat’s Olivia for you.\nShe’s a kind [VAR COLOR(0001)]kahuna[VAR COLOR(0000)], deep down.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are [VAR COLOR(0001)]three trials[VAR COLOR(0000)] here on Akala Island.\c\nIf you two decide you want to take on the trial\nstraightaway, head up Route 4 there and keep\r\non goin’ until you get to Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Shoots, I know where I’m going first,\nand that is straight to the Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wonder what kind of malasada they make\non Akala, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Maybe I’ll see about some shopping of my own...\c\nAnd I should find out about the ruins for\nNebby’s sake, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Here we are on Akala, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl!\c\nYou know what that meanzzz?\nIt meanzzz a new Akala [VAR COLOR(0001)]Island Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)], zzt!\c\nTry to find lotzzz of new Pokémon to fill it up![VAR 0114(0035)]

Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
You looking for the ruins?
You looking for new clothes?
Yes, this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, yes, I was doing that, too.\nBut this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
I wondered if you’d like to come with us when\nwe go to visit the ruins...\c\nI mean...little Nebby here seems to like you quite\na bit, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be at Tide Song Hotel if you decide you want\nto come.\c\nI’m supposed to be meeting someone there...\nSomeone very important to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be all right.\nI can see the building from here, after all.\r\nEven I shouldn’t be able to lose my way. I think.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
And you! I’ll have you stay in your bag, mister.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve heard that there is a group of terrible\npeople around who try to steal Pokémon.\r\nA group called Team Skull.\c\nWe need to be careful if we want to escape the\nnotice of such a collection of villains...\c\nIsn’t that right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I wonder if the guardian of Akala will also be\ninterested in you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nYou are the one who got that Sparkling Stone.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Stop right there![VAR 0114(0030)]
Ah ha ha! We didn’t mean to surprise you.\nYou must be doing your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m Dexio.[VAR 0114(0027)]
My name’s Sina!\nA beautiful name for a beautiful lady![VAR 0114(0026)]
We’re here seeing the sights in Alola.\c\nIts unique tradition of island challenge...\nIt’s pretty fascinating, I’ve got to say.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nYou and Dexio should battle![VAR 0114(0026)]
And why should we do that?\c\nThough I might as well test my skills.\c\nIs that all right with you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Then I’ll let my partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
If you’d ever like to battle, I’d be willing.\nJust ask.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nWhy don’t you test your skills with me?[VAR 0114(0026)]
OK! Let’s get this show on the road![VAR 0114(0026)]
OK, I’ll wait till you’re up to the challenge of my\nawesome team![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s what I would expect from a Trainer\ndoing the island challenge.\c\nI felt the bond between you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
I get it... Facing trials helps you grow close to\nyour team.\c\nI think that’s absolutely wonderful![VAR 0114(0026)]
I feel like I’ve been able to have a glimpse of\nthe island challenge!\c\nLet me heal your Pokémon as thanks![VAR 0114(0026)]
You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team!\nNo doubt about it!\c\nThis battle reminded me of us in the past...and\nthat group of five young Trainers.\c\nTake this as a little token of our new friendship![VAR 0114(0027)]
Maybe training yourself up a bit on Route 4 will\nhelp you understand your Pokémon even better.\c\nWe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

Hey! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Glad I ran into you...\c\nSo we can see who’s stronger now!\c\nI got a Z-Power Ring from my gramps, too,\nafter making it through his grand trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
Having a battle in a place like Paniola Town\nfeels like we’re in a real old-fashioned Western\r\nshowdown or something, right?\r\nThis is so cool!\c\nThough if we’re real honorable cowboys, we’ve\ngotta make sure our teams are healthy first.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Awrite, team!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] and Pikachu and everybody,\nyou oughta all be bursting with energy after\r\neating a pile of my mom’s special pancakes,\r\nso let’s show this newbie what Alola’s got![VAR 0114(0007)]
Ma-a-an, that was some kinda battle!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] and everybody all look like\nthey had a blast, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Trrrrilll!
Nrarrr!
Bwon!
Right then. Here. I’ll share my bit of good luck\nwith you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
You know how the Totem Pokémon are all, like,\nsurrounded by some aura of power?\c\nIf you use a Dire Hit on your Pokémon and\nmanage to land a critical hit, that aura won’t\r\nmean a thing!\c\nYou might wanna try using some of those\nRotom Powers when you’re fighting a totem, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
You know, Pokémon battles are just, like,\nsometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\c\nBut you’re only really a loser if you don’t have\nany fun while you’re at it. Right?\c\nAnyway, I’m heading off to Paniola Ranch![VAR 0114(0007)]

The Moomoo Milk from Paniola Ranch is the\nbest. It’s so rich and creamy when you use\r\nit in white sauce and other things...\r\nMmm! The taste can’t even be described![VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, by the way! Since I was lucky enough to run\ninto you here, I’ll do you a little favor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Stoutland was registered to your Ride Pager!
See, Stoutland can sniff out items for you that\nare buried in the dirt where you can’t even\r\nsee them!\c\nWhen you’re riding Stoutland, pressing  to use\nthat Stoutland [VAR COLOR(0001)]Search[VAR COLOR(0000)] is what it’s all about![VAR 0114(000E)]
Get up there and try it! There’s all kinds of\nstuff lying around waiting for you to find it.\c\nAnd Stoutland will bark louder and louder the\ncloser it gets to some item buried in the ground![VAR 0114(000E)]
If you go all the way down Route 5, you’ll come\nout on Brooklet Hill. My friend Lana is up there,\r\nso say hi to her for me if you see her![VAR 0114(000E)]

Ha ha ha!\nMan, I lost again![VAR 0114(0007)]
Are you even taking this seriously?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am! So seriously!\nI’m seriously enjoying it![VAR 0114(0007)]
...Enjoying it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
You can enjoy Pokémon battling when you put\neverything you have into it...\r\nwhich clearly you haven’t.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Whoa!\nHey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
This guy is plenny scary![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Yeah, that’s me
Nope, not me
Who?
Hmph. Not very cautious.\c\nEven some Pokémon have a better sense of\nself-preservation than you apparently do.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hmm. So you have enough sense to be wary.\nNot bad...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m Gladion.\c\nMe and my partner, Type: Null, are training to\nget stronger...\r\nWe have to get stronger!\c\nThough most of our time these days goes to\nworking for Team Skull as their muscle.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Battle me.\nI won’t take no for an answer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmph... \nIt’s not like me to slip up like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve got to keep fighting stronger opponents.\nLooks like I’m still not ready...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What?
Strong opponents?
That kid there.\nHis Pokémon aren’t weak.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And sure, it’s fine to enjoy battling...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But this brat...\c\nhe’s just using that as an excuse not to try\nhard because he can’t beat the kahuna.\r\nBecause he can’t beat Hala when he’s serious![VAR 0114(0013)]
You know my gramps?\nWait. So you think I’m strong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Awww, look at you, little Gladion!\nAren’t you just a real cool guy? Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(0031)]
I guess it’s no surprise a homeless kid would\nturn out spineless, too, huh?\c\nNo worries! We’ve got enough backbone to\ncover for you![VAR 0114(0032)]
Just give it up already.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
You know you can’t beat me.\nYou’ll just get your Pokémon hurt for no reason.[VAR 0114(0013)]
They’re good Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We came all this way, and for what?\nFor a big fat waste of our time, thanks to you.\c\nIf you hadn’t gotten in our way, we could’ve\nstolen the Totem Pokémon from Brooklet Hill![VAR 0114(0032)]
Let’s get out of here. Look, the Murkrow are\ncrying, and it’s time we should be flying.[VAR 0114(0032)]
Listen up good, Gladion...\nThe boss does like you. That’s true.\c\nBut you’re just some hired help we keep around\nfor when we need you.\c\nYou aren’t part of Team Skull, not really.\nAnd you never will be. Got it? You better get it.[VAR 0114(0031)]
Thanks, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nAnd [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.\r\nYou both gave it your all![VAR 0114(0007)]
Phew... Looks like I’ve gotta train up my team if\nI’m gonna take on the trial at Brooklet Hill next!\c\nHere, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], take these with you.\nWe’re gonna beat this island challenge![VAR 0114(0007)]
Doing squats really uses all your muscles!\nMy legs are shaking so hard, I can’t move!
I’m not doing Alolan sumo! I’m not!\nI’m definitely not trying to be like Kahuna Hala!

So, brave trial-goer, I would like to ask you to\ninvestigate that splashing there and find out\r\nwhat exactly is causing it.\c\nI won’t ask you to swim out there, of course.\nI have a lovely gift for you instead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able\nto travel over bodies of water.\c\nThat’s right. You’ll even be able to reach those\nsplashes and see what is going on there.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Did you see that splashing?\nI wonder what it is...\c\nI’d go and check it out for myself, but clinging\nto a clammy Lapras over the waves... Urp!\r\nIt makes me seasick just thinking about it!
Oh my...\c\nSo it was Wishiwashi kicking up all that water?\c\nEven a little Wishiwashi can make such\nbig waves...[VAR 0114(000D)]
*splash splash* 
Oh me. What is that?\c\nI can hear wild splashing from over there...\nIt sounds even larger than what we just saw.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Whatever is kicking up such lovely splashes\nmust be rather big...\c\nA strapping young Swimmer, perhaps?\nOr an amazing Pokémon specimen?[VAR 0114(000D)]

Oh my.\c\nSo it was another Wishiwashi that was kicking\nup all that water?\c\nHmm. How unfortunate.\nIt wasn’t a strapping young Swimmer after all...[VAR 0114(000D)]
*splash splash splash splash*
Oh my word!\c\nNow what is that? Even more furious splashing?\nIt sounds as big as a Wailord.[VAR 0114(000D)]
It might just be another Pokémon, but...\c\nMaybe, just maybe, we’ll be lucky enough to\nfind a spry young Swimmer floundering in the\r\nwater and in need of saving![VAR 0114(000D)]

That’s right. Didn’t you notice? You passed\nthrough the captain’s barricade by my side.\r\nWhich means that you will undergo my trial![VAR 0114(000D)]
To clear my trial, you must defeat the great\nTotem Pokémon known as the lord of the ocean![VAR 0114(000D)]
That spray of water you can see there!\nThat is where you will probably find the totem.\c\nAnd perhaps those Wishiwashi you battled\nagainst will also want their revenge...\c\nDefeat whatever comes at you and prove your\nstrength to me![VAR 0114(000D)]
And remember that you cannot catch any\nPokémon here unless you complete my trial.\c\nSo let the trial begin![VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 6]

Defeat the totem that is causing all that sea\nspray, and prove your strength to me.\c\nAnd...well, you may find that using Grass- or\nElectric-type moves will be to your advantage.\c\nOr you could always resort to using an X Sp. Def\nor two or perhaps a Dire Hit.\c\nDo not let your guard down.\nThe totem is not to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Very well done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nPlease come back this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I...I must say that I find myself at an\nimpasse here.\c\nAll of the Wishiwashi that I so diligently trained\nup were defeated, and that is very frustrating...\c\nbut of course I cannot let your completion of my\ntrial go uncelebrated, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
You were amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And that’s not all I can offer you.\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you\nfish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 7]
You did?!
Did you really?
Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Good. Let’s be going then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Wait, those were Pokémon?! I totally thought\nthey were just plants![VAR 0114(0037)]
Calm yourself, Zossie. Those must have been\nthe Pokémon known as Sudowoodo.\c\nA most interesting Pokémon.\nI wish I could research them further.\c\nThey must be mimicking plant life in an attempt\nto avoid their weakness—water. [VAR 0114(0036)]
These Alolan Pokémon... \nThey’re all so unique. It’s truly fascinating...\c\nBut battling them is not easy.[VAR 0114(0036)]
So I challenge you with one we are accustomed\nto...Poipole![VAR 0114(0036)]
I knew it!\nYou can’t just challenge people like that!\c\nSorry, Mis[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0103)]ters Trainer.\nBut do you think a battle would be OK?[VAR 0114(0037)]
That’s what I thought. It’s way too sudden![VAR 0114(0037)]
Our research is insufficient to define what it\nmeans to be a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nWe’ll never be able to stop Necrozma like this...[VAR 0114(0036)]
I will warn you now. \nPoipole cannot be found anywhere in Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
I must research the reason for my defeat...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Your Z-Power Ring...\nIt’s so pretty when it shines like that![VAR 0114(0037)]
What are you suggesting? That it might be like\nthe beautiful light our ancestors once saw?[VAR 0114(0036)]
How should I know?\c\nSee you around, Trainer![VAR 0114(0037)]
Oho! These Sudowoodo are fascinating\nPokémon as well, worthy of being a research\r\ntopic all on their own!\c\nThe way they mimic plants in order to avoid\nwater... How very interesting.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Just as our research suggested, Captain Phyco.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Indeed... We must gather data about Pokémon\nif we want to win Pokémon battles, after all.[VAR 0114(0039)]
That being said, there is no need for us to use\nthese odd Alolan Pokémon.\c\nSoliera, if you would be so kind...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Trainer, could I ask you to face me in a\nPokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0038)]
I would very much like you to face me, so I will\nwait over here.[VAR 0114(0038)]
I have created a few on my own, but these\nPoké Balls are the most peculiar devices![VAR 0114(0039)]
Then... I will face you with my Poipole.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Thank you very much...\c\nI was able to understand Poipole better, but it\nseems my Pokémon battle skills leave much\r\nto be desired...[VAR 0114(0038)]
That Z-Power Ring of yours...\nIts light feels somehow nostalgic.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Do you think it is the same light our ancestors\ngazed upon? The light said to have come from\r\nthe Blinding One?[VAR 0114(0038)]
Who can tell? Yet it is our duty as the Ultra\nRecon Squad to find that out.[VAR 0114(0039)]
[~ 25]
Hey!\nLooks like you passed Lana’s trial, huh?\c\nAnd you got that Waterium Z, huh?\nThe Sudowoodo can’t take that at all!
Those weird people had weird Pokémon to\nmatch! Well, I guess it’s not a big deal.\c\nThe weird people are gone, and so are the\nSudowoodo! Now everyone can use the road\r\nagain. Here’s a little something for you in return!
I wonder if maybe those Sudowoodo ran off to\nthe Battle Royal Dome to try to get stronger...\c\nYou know about the Battle Royal Dome, right?\nThat’s the place where you enter Battle Royals!

Yo, yo, yo!\nDon’t go turning your backside on us![VAR 0114(0031)]
And YOU!\nYou’re that numskull Trainer from Melemele, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
These scoundrels are Pokémon thieves.\nAnd you’re on familiar terms with them?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Well, yeah, I know them
I don’t know who they are!
Yeah, that’s right, you do![VAR 0114(0031)]
Yo, for real?![VAR 0114(0031)]
I am Hapu.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Life in the big city sure is something else.\c\nPokémon thieves roam about brazenly...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hmm, I leave that one to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We’re not thieves, yo!\nIt’s a legitimate business![VAR 0114(0031)]
We got straight messed up in Melemele...\ngot exiled to Akala...\c\nbut we ain’t goin’ out like that![VAR 0114(0032)]
With all these losses,\nwe’re gonna anger our bosses!\c\nThese tears taste like salt, yo!\nIt’s all your fault, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
Floooon?
Ne-hiiiiii!
Mudsdale, shall we stomp these scoundrels?\c\nIt’ll be a mess to clean up afterward, but\nI am willing if you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for us to break out, yo!\nGotta tell y’all peace out, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
I’m not gonna keep telling you this...\nexcept when I keep telling you this!\c\nYou better listen to what my homie says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nSeriously! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]
You’ll be fine getting home?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Floo-oooon...
Glad to see that Drifloon will get home\non her own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got you to thank for that.\nGive me your name, Trainer.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], eh?\nThat’s a fine name.\c\nI like the way you handled yourself in battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Mudsdale and I are always wandering all\nabout Alola to try to achieve our goals, so\r\nperhaps we’ll meet again someday.\r\nI am indebted to you for your aid, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ni-hiii!
Ah yes.\c\nYou might want to try your hand at a \n[VAR COLOR(0001)]Battle Royal [VAR COLOR(0000)]or two, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nMudsdale here thinks you’d be well suited to it,\ngiven how strong you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]

I’m gonna need you to find four ingredients\nfor me!\c\nI’ll need a Mago Berry, a Tiny Mushroom,\na Revival Herb, and a Miracle Seed![VAR 0114(000E)]
Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold\nall the ingredients gathered for your trial.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you put the trial ingredients in your own bag,\nthey’d get mixed up with your stuff, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
When you’re hunting for ingredients, you’re\ngonna want to rely on Stoutland’s help.\r\nIt’ll find things that you don’t see, after all.\c\nYou remember what I told you at the farm,\nright? Just press the B Button to use\r\nStoutland Search![VAR 0114(000E)]

There are some mushrooms sprouting in the soil.\nWhich mushrooms do you need?
Tiny Mushrooms
Big Mushrooms
You put a Tiny Mushroom in your Forage Bag!
You tried putting the Big Mushroom in your\nForage Bag...
But the Big Mushroom attacked!
Hey, it’s me, Mallow!\nOoh, a Tiny Mushroom! That’s great![VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s a secret to why they’re so popular with\nsome people. You’ll have to try one to find out\r\nwhat it is![VAR 0114(000E)]
Ooh, looks like you got everything!\c\nOK, it’s time for us to start cooking, so come on\nback to the entrance of the jungle![VAR 0114(000E)]

It’s a patch of rather suspicious-looking grass.\nWill you pull it up?
It’s a Revival Herb!\c\nYou put the Revival Herb in your Forage Bag!
It’s a Revival Herb!\c\nWait... No, it’s not!\nOn second glance, it’s just a normal weed!
A Pokémon leaped out of the grass to attack!
Hey, it’s me, Mallow!\nThat’s a fine Revival Herb![VAR 0114(000E)]
Its bitter bite is even a shock to Pokémon,\nbut that’s what will add depth to the flavor![VAR 0114(000E)]

Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park my\nvaunted Salazzle didn’t stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Nor did the Wishiwashi that I had trained\nso carefully...[VAR 0114(000D)]
All right, you’ve cleared all three of\nAkala’s trials!\c\nYou even managed to get through my\ntrial, and I’d say it’s a real doozy!\r\nHere! A gift for such an inspiring young Trainer![VAR 0114(000E)]
You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Grassium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let me show you how to use Grass-type\nZ-Moves! You go like “Graaassss,” ’K?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Since you’ve cleared my trial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nI want you to help me train some Pokémon from\r\nhere in Lush Jungle.\c\nHere, have some Nest Balls![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hm?\nLooks like Lurantis didn’t finish all the food.\c\nOooh, I really want you guys to try some!\nHave a bite, Kiawe! You, too, Lana![VAR 0114(000E)]
If you insist.[VAR 0114(000F)]

The flavor from the Rare Bone seems to fill\nmy whole mouth...[VAR 0114(000D)]
It tastes so good you might melt...\nNo, wait. Is that my tongue that’s melting...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Uhhn![VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s...it’s so...[VAR 0114(000D)]

Lush Jungle has some tough Pokémon, it’s true.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nNow get back in there and do your best![VAR 0114(000E)]

My Marowak and I are students of the ancient\ndances that have been passed down in Alola\r\nfor generations.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The trial of Kiawe...\c\nYou will find that it is a bit different than the\ntrials you have faced to this point, but of\r\ncourse, you will attempt it, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course!
Not right now
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it looks like you have\nfailed my trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
In my trial several Pokémon will appear, and you\nwill indeed battle them.\c\nBy carefully observing their dance, you can\navoid unnecessary battles. Never forget that\r\nthis is one way to approach the trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The Totem Pokémon Marowak is a Fire- and\nGhost-type Pokémon.\c\nIt has many weaknesses: Water, Rock, Ground,\nDark, and even Ghost type.[VAR 0114(000F)]

What was different from the previous dance?[VAR 0114(000F)]
The right Marowak
The middle Marowak
The left Marowak
Show me again!
B-but how?!\c\nThat was truly spectacular!\nAnd to add to the spectacle...\c\nCome, Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]
Wa-wak!
Marowak was so pleased by your right answer\nthat it simply had to battle you![VAR 0114(000F)]

Whoa!\c\nS-spectacular!\c\nWith your keen observations, you were able to\nsee even fine differences in our dances!\c\nAnd you defeated the Totem Pokémon with\nsuch ease![VAR 0114(000F)]
The Totem Pokémon protected this Firium Z.\nNow it is yours.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This is how you use the Fire-type Z-Power![VAR 0114(000F)]
Thank you, my dear Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]
For when you meet a Pokémon that you would\nlike to make your companion, take these![VAR 0114(000F)]
What’s more!\c\nYou may now use the Ride Pokémon Charizard.\c\nCharizard will lend you his strength, and you\nwill be able to go anywhere you have been in\r\nan instant.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Charizard was registered to your Ride Pager!
The Firium Z...you should show it to the\nTrial Guide outside the captain’s barricade at\r\nthe bottom of the mountain.\c\nIt is time for us to return to our dance.\nThe feelings of the Alolan people and our\r\nPokémon, and the true nature of Z-Power...\c\nThe answers lie in our dance!

Wow!\nThe aura readings are going crazy![VAR 0114(0037)]
Hey! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0037)]
Interesting... So this is what you call a tunnel...\nI would like to investigate it further if we only\r\nhad the time to do so...\c\nGreetings, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt seems your island challenge is going well?[VAR 0114(0036)]
It appears that my guess was correct: battling\nthe Totem Pokémon, which are wrapped in aura,\r\nis having an effect on you as well.[VAR 0114(0036)]
And those Z-Moves also envelop your ally\nPokémon in aura, do they not?\c\n...Are you able to fully control aura then?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Sure I can
Not really
I suppose it does not matter to us either way.\c\nBut once...long, long ago...our world was also\nawash in wondrous light, like the light of those\r\nZ-Moves that you can use...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Dulse?\nIt’s about time for our meeting.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Yes.\c\nWe will be getting the aid of a scientist who is\nwell educated in the ways of Pokémon.\c\nWe will need his help to find ways we might use\nour technology to achieve our goals.[VAR 0114(0036)]
What is this?\c\nThe numbers keep climbing in my aura readings.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Ah. [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI bid you Alola.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Hmm... This fine tunnel...\c\nIt is most fascinating to learn that there are a\nvariety of construction methods made possible\r\nby the Pokémon that lend their aid to humans.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Trial-goers clear many trials.\c\nIt is only natural, perhaps, that such a Trainer\nwould exude aura after coming in contact with\r\nso many Totem Pokémon awash in aura.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Oh, and you, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady...\nYou seem to have even more Z-Crystals than\r\nwhen last we met.\c\nDo you hope to master the Z-Moves?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Sure I do
Not really
That wondrous light that appears when a\nZ-Move is used...\r\nWe once had such light in our world as well.\c\nAnd it was precious to us, even if we did not\nuse it to battle with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Captain Phyco.\nIt is nearly time.[VAR 0114(0038)]
While our technology is advanced, it must be\nmodified to work to its fullest with Pokémon.\c\nWe must go now to meet with a scientist who is\nversed in the ways of Pokémon, or we will have\r\nno hope of achieving such a thing.[VAR 0114(0039)]

You there![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist.\nMy name is Colress.\c\nThe theme of my research is:\n“Bringing out the potential of Pokémon.”\c\nWhat brings out the power of Pokémon is...[VAR 0114(002B)]
I believe that is—the bond they share with\ntheir Trainers![VAR 0114(002B)]
And thus my attention is drawn to Trainers\nlike yourself...\c\nTrainers bound to their Pokémon through the\npower of the Z-Power Ring![VAR 0114(002B)]
Now that I think of it, I never asked your name.\c\n...[VAR 0114(002B)]

Z-Power...\c\nIs it the true potential that I seek?\nDoes it surpass the Mega Ring?\c\nApparently, there are uninhabited islands for\nPokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Poké Pelago[VAR COLOR(0000)] here in Alola.\c\nAlola is fascinating! I believe that I will stay in\nAlola for some time![VAR 0114(002B)]
Well then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI hope you will excuse me.\c\nI’ve had quite the curious request made to me\nby a couple of most oddly dressed strangers.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], is it?\nI’ll remember your name.\c\nTo commemorate our encounter, let me give\nyou a TM.[VAR 0114(002B)]

Olivia is an expert user of Rock-type Pokémon.\nYou’re gonna wanna catch some Grass-type\r\nPokémon in Lush Jungle to add to your team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Whenever you’re ready for the grand trial, come\nsee me at the Dimensional Research Lab!\c\nIt’s down past Route 6, yeah, but just ask\nRotom if you need some help![VAR 0114(0005)]

No worries! I’ll teach you how to visit it.\nI just heard about it for the first time, too...\c\nLet’s see, I think she said...\nYeah, you’re supposed to open up your X menu,\r\nthen tap on Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0007)]
Festival Plaza seems pretty good, huh?\c\nEven my old gramps tried it out.\nIt’s great to get to meet so many different folks!\c\nNow I’m gonna go have some fun with my team![VAR 0114(0007)]

How...how were your trials?\nIt must be quite trying to do three in a row.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It was no problem
It was really tough
Goodness, really? It wasn’t any trouble for you\nto tackle all three of Akala Island’s trials?\c\nI suppose that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh, hi![VAR 0114(0030)]
This here’s Professor Burnet.\c\nShe runs the Dimensional Research Lab, yeah...\c\nAnd she’s also my wife![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\nLillie told me about you.\c\nShe said you were the reliable sort.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Three months ago...\c\nI found Lillie lying on a beach.\c\nCosmog in her bag also unconscious.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hm?\nNo Hau today?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hau? He’s out doing his own thing.\c\nBut he’ll be the real deal someday... He could\neven become a kahuna, just like old Hala\r\nbefore him![VAR 0114(0005)]
You really think so?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whoa-ho!\c\nWell, yeah, I really do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good to see you again, Hau!\nIt’s been a while since I last saw you.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Anyhow, I brought [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here\nbecause I wanted you to tell h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer about some of\r\nthe mysterious phenomena here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d be happy to!\c\nThe mysteries of Alola, huh?\nThen you’ve got to mean...[VAR 0114(001B)]
the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Ultra Wormhole[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a hole opens\nin the sky over Alola.\c\nIt appears that this rift leads to a different\nand unknown dimension.[VAR 0114(001B)]
The reason that people think there may be a\nmysterious dimension is because of the legends\r\nof fearsome Pokémon appearing from the Ultra\r\nWormhole.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Pew...
It’s very weak as proof, but I can’t ignore it.\c\nThere is also plenty of evidence already in the\nPokédex for the existence of different\r\ndimensions, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Fearsome Pokémon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Even normal wild Pokémon sometimes attack\npeople, right?\c\nBut the Pokémon that appeared from the Ultra\nWormhole went way beyond that.[VAR 0114(001B)]
They were called Ultra Beasts...\nAnd they were feared.\c\nIf the stories are to be believed, the guardian\ndeities of the islands fought desperately\r\nagainst them.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But like I said, it’s all legends and folktales.\nIt’s hard to know how much is true.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But I would be very happy if I could somehow\nunravel the mysteries of the Ultra Wormhole by\r\nstudying the dimensional disturbances![VAR 0114(001B)]
We’ve recorded several known relationships\nbetween Pokémon and different dimensions\r\nin books. You can find them on the bookshelves\r\nin this lab.[VAR 0114(001B)]

You want to know what happened three\nmonths ago?\c\nWell, I’d wanted to learn more about Nebby...\c\nI mean, about Cosmog.\c\nSo I decided to come speak to Professor Burnet.\c\nBut I got lost along the way...and ended up\nwandering about until I collapsed on the shore...[VAR 0114(0006)]
She listened to my story, staying up all night to\nhear it all. And then she even got her husband,\r\nProfessor Kukui, to lend me his loft to stay in...\c\nAnd she told him to help me investigate\nNebby’s origins, too.\c\nProfessor Burnet has been so kind, and she’s\nstill helping me try to find a way to get Nebby\r\nback to its own home...[VAR 0114(0006)]

You’ve finished all three of Akala’s trials. Woo!\nAnd now comes the big match against Olivia—\r\nthe island kahuna!\c\nIt’s the biggest and baddest trial of them all\nhere on Akala—the grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]

Phew...\c\nWith Olivia in charge, we’ve finally managed to\nmake some headway against those Diglett.
Oh! Alola!\c\nWe’re members of the Aether Foundation.\nWe work to support Pokémon conservation.
It seems like Team Skull was responsible for\nthe Diglett in this cave getting so riled up and\r\nbringing them all up to the surface.
Oh, Team Skull is this group of troublemakers,\nyou see...\c\nThey seem to delight in interfering with Trainers\nand their Pokémon.
Diglett normally live in elaborate systems of\nunderground tunnels that take years to dig out.\c\nWe’re here to ensure that they return to their\ntunnels and let people pass through here\r\nwithout having to fight so many Pokémon.
Some of the Diglett are still stuck on or near the\nsurface, though, so be careful!

I help keep Team Skull together.\nI’m like a big sister to all these numskulls.\c\nYou have realized what idiots all these guys\nare, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
But don’t you think some dummies are cute\nin their dumbness?\c\nYou know what I mean, right? You picking on\nmy cute, dumb brothers and sisters is really\r\nannoying me![VAR 0114(0018)]

Now I’ve gotta go. The Masked Royal has a\nmatch, and there’s no way that I’m missing it![VAR 0114(001B)]

Within these ruins waits the guardian deity of\nAkala Island...\r\nThis is Tapu Lele’s ruin.[VAR 0114(0006)]

You! I know you tried to drag me along to the\nRuins of Conflict on Melemele Island, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why are these ruins important to you?\nWhat do the guardians mean to you?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh.

Pew?
You certainly don’t see Pokémon like that\nevery day.\c\nTapu Lele may be called the guardian deity of\nour island, but it can also run wild at times.\c\nRegular Pokémon normally avoid the guardians\nat all costs...\c\nUnless they are strong enough to face the\ntapu themselves, that is.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Wait, that can’t be right...[VAR 0114(0009)]
I think your journey will hold many surprises.\nAnd I hope it holds many joys.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ll take you back to town, Lillie.\c\nYou’re doing everything you can for your\npartner, even though you’re not a Trainer.\c\nI like that kind of person, so I can’t help but\ngive you a hand![VAR 0114(0009)]

Good, good. Then you’ll come with me.\nAether Paradise will amaze you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hmm. Yes.\c\nWell, children are often too frivolous and\naimless to properly think through—\r\nAhem. I mean they value their freedom so.\c\nBut the answer that I want to hear from you is\na resounding “Yes!” Now let’s hear it![VAR 0114(0015)]
Wait!\nTake me, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh?\nEven Kahuna Olivia has come to see you off?[VAR 0114(0015)]
As a kahuna, I look after all the trial-goers who\ncome to my island. They’re like my own children.\c\nNot that I’ve got any—I’ve never even\ngotten married.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Listen up, you two.\c\nYour greatest opponent is always yourself.\nYour greatest allies, the Pokémon beside you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Thanks!\c\nAre you coming, too, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve got my own business to attend to.\c\nYou go see all the amazing tech that Aether’s\ndeveloping and tell me about it later, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right. I’ll see you on the next island...\c\nUla’ula Island, yeah?\nThen let’s meet up at Malie Garden![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yup! It’s good-bye, Akala Island!\c\nThough I guess we can come back anytime\nwe want to, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Aether Paradise is a safe haven for all Pokémon.\c\nFor this reason, the use of Poké Balls is strictly\nforbidden within the conservation area.
Wow![VAR 0114(0007)]
We keep Pokémon that have been targeted by\nTeam Skull here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
And we also try to support Pokémon that need\na little extra protection.\c\nLike Corsola, for example. They are quite terribly\noverhunted by a Pokémon called Mareanie.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I hope you don’t mind if I read a passage from\nmy old Pokédex.\c\nI traveled through Kanto before, when I was\nyounger, you see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
“Corsola.\c\n“In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie\nare plentiful, many Corsola have stubby\r\nbranches on their heads.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah. My gramps is always saying that nature’s\ngot its cruel side, sure as it gives us blessings.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But can the Aether Foundation really protect\nall the Pokémon that’re out there?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Nature does have its own balance, of course.\c\nIt can be difficult to judge just how much we\nhumans should try to affect that, can’t it?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That’s pretty amazing!\nThe Aether Foundation seems awesome.\c\nBut why’d you bother setting up a branch in\na place like Alola?![VAR 0114(0007)]
I couldn’t say...\c\nIt’s hard to know for sure what our president\nis thinking sometimes.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’d like to meet President Lusamine, she\nshould be here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 214

This is where we look after the Pokémon that\nare commonly known as “regional variants.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
There are several species of Pokémon that\nseem to have adapted to the Alola region.\c\nThey have different appearances, and even\ntypes, in Alola than they do in other regions.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What is it in the climate and features of this \nregion that is affecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters, such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve been aided in our research by Professor\nOak, who is in Ula’ula, among others...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh yeah, I remember!\c\nThe Meowth in your house is different from the\nones in Alola, isn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah
It is?
So that’s why! I never knew that Alola was\nso cool like that. Regional variants, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ha ha ha! OK, next time we’re back home,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we should compare Meowth![VAR 0114(0007)]
If you’d like to continue on, I think you will find\nthe president is still in the area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’d like to meet President Lusamine,\nshe’s here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Wow, there are even Pokémon that got done in\nby Team Skull, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]

You must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Hau.\c\nWelcome to Aether Paradise.\nThe Aether Foundation’s own private island.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am the president of the foundation.\nBut please, just call me Lusamine.\c\nI’m so glad that we got to meet.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m glad there are people like you, who travel\nthe islands to learn more about Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
But there are also those unfortunate\npeople who harm Pokémon for their\r\nown selfish reasons or even for profit.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And that is why I am here.\c\nI will be like a mother to all of those poor\nPokémon and shower them with love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Even Pokémon from distant worlds, far from\nthe Alola region, are worthy of my love.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Why so shocked?\nWas it your first time seeing an Ultra Beast?\c\nThose mysterious creatures that live beyond\nthe Ultra Wormholes, the holes that suddenly\r\nopen in the sky and lead to Ultra Space...\r\nIt would serve you well to remember this.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Who the—?!\nSeriously, what’s with that getup?![VAR 0114(0007)]
These are my guests. The Ultra Recon Squad.\c\nThey have been giving the foundation advice\nabout the Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0014)]

And I’m Zossie![VAR 0114(0037)]
So we meet again, trial-goer.[VAR 0114(0039)]
The Ultra Recon Squad is—\c\nWell, as the name suggests, it is a group that\ninvestigates Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.\c\nThis is Captain Phyco.\nAnd I am Soliera.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Ultra Wormholes?
Ultra Beasts?
We came to the Alola region from another world\nby passing through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWe came from a world of darkness, whose light\nwas stolen by the one called Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Our world is a world without light...\c\nThe light was stolen by a creature known to\nus as Necrozma.\r\nA creature almost like an Ultra Beast.\c\nAnd someday it will come to steal the light of\nAlola as well...like an eclipse that never passes.[VAR 0114(0036)]
See, this Necrozma is, like, unbelievably strong!\c\nIt can wield light however it likes, and sure, it\ndoes run wild sometimes, but it also shares this\r\nmysterious light it has with others, too![VAR 0114(0037)]
We have also come to the Alola region from\nanother world, via an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nA world of darkness, without light...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Our world is wrapped in darkness.\c\nThough it also shone with light once, long ago...[VAR 0114(0039)]
There is a creature...known as Necrozma.\c\nIt is able to bestow light upon others, but now it\nruns wild, beyond reason.\c\nWe call it the Blinding One out of respect, but...\c\nI fear that the day may come when Alola loses\nits light to Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0038)]
But everything will be fine.\c\nIf this Necrozma, or even an Ultra Beast like\nthe one we just saw, should come to this world\r\nfrom another, the Aether Foundation will be\r\nprepared to protect the light of Alola.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rest easy...\nYou will not need to worry about a thing.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Sure
No way
Aww!\nAre you just trying to bring me down or what?[VAR 0114(0007)]
All right!\nThen let’s go full powered on this one![VAR 0114(0007)]
You know what, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou should take this Lycanium Z, too!\c\nIt came as a set with those Big Malasadas that\nMs. Wicke gave me, but I don’t plan on adding\r\nany Lycanroc to my team or anything.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You and your Pokémon looked like you were\nhaving a blast, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI guess it’s like my gramps said...\c\nGo beyond winning and losing, and learn to find\njoy in any battle...then you’ll find that you’re\r\ngetting strong before you even know it![VAR 0114(0007)]
Trrril!
Mraw!
Brrril!
What? You mad that I still don’t seem to be\ngetting all that much stronger?\c\nI sure hope not! Me and my partner oughta\nbe, like, totally in sync with one another![VAR 0114(0007)]
We’ll get there, buddy.\c\nNow I guess we should go try to track down\nProfessor Kukui in Malie Garden, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Ho!\nProfessor Kukui![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey there!\c\nWhat’s going on with you two?\nYour eyes are shining extra bright today.\r\nDid something big happen?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It sure did!
Only something AMAZING!
Professor! Professor! You gotta hear this!\c\nAn Ultra Wormhole opened up, like, right in \nfront of us, and there really are Ultra Beasts in\r\nthere! And aliens from other worlds, too!\r\nYou’ve gotta tell Professor Burnet, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Woo! You got to see the Ultra Wormhole and an\nUltra Beast? And folks from another world?!\r\nThat IS amazing, oh yeah!\c\nSounds like an even better reason to train\nhard, yeah, on your island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Maybe someday we’ll all be able to go through\nthe Ultra Wormhole![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right! Your next trial is up on Mount Hokulani!\c\nYou can catch the bus to get there.\nJust head to the bus stop on Route 10, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You guys can go ahead without me, Professor.\c\nI’ve got a hot date with a malasada shop!\c\nI’m gonna get my Pokémon some treats so they’ll\nreally start to like me![VAR 0114(0007)]
Roger that, good buddy!\c\nI’ll be waiting at the bus stop, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nwhenever you’re ready to go![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], did you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]

I haven’t even finished the question yet.[VAR 0114(0007)]
There’s an observatory up on Mount Hokulani!\c\nAnd you do know what it is they do at an\nobservatory, right?\c\nHope you do, ’cause I sure as heck don’t.[VAR 0114(0007)]

Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’m glad I ran into you...\nI was actually wondering...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
Wh-what did you think of her?\nThe president of the Aether Foundation, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
She was nice
I don’t know
Is...is that right?\c\nOf course. She must be nice.\c\nShe’s trying to protect Pokémon, isn’t she?
Right... Of course...\c\nI just thought maybe you’d met with her.\nI’m sorry for asking you something so strange.
Um, anyway...\nWhat I really wanted to ask about was...
You want to go to the ruins?
Is it about Nebby?
Yes. I want to take Nebby to visit Ula’ula’s ruins,\nbut they are located deep in a large desert.\r\nI don’t want to ask that much of you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Right now, I’m planning to visit Malie Library.\c\nThere’s a book that I want to look for there.\nMaybe you’d even be willing to help me?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I know that Malie Library is here within the\ncity of Malie somewhere...\r\nEven I should be able to find it. I can do this![VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nI’m sorry...\nI ended up getting lost, yet again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I wandered around completely lost until I ducked\ninto the apparel shop...\c\nAnd then I saw this outfit, and they said it was\nthe last one they had in stock, so I bought it...\c\nEven though I don’t think I’d ever have the guts\nto wear an outfit like it... Hah...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew...
But the woman working at the store did tell me\nwhere to find the library!\r\nSo I guess you could say it was all for the best.\c\n...Though the library was actually right past the\napparel store, if I’d just kept going.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ne-e-eh!

[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nBeen a while, friend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Looks like your island challenge is coming along\nfavorably. That must be pleasing to the tapu.[VAR 0114(000B)]

So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], who might this be?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Hello...\nMy name is Lillie.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My apologies if Mudsdale spooked you just now.\c\nDoesn’t seem like you’re a trial-goer.\nWhat are you up to?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh. I’m actually, um, studying the tapu’s ruins.\nFor...various reasons of my own.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 13]
Well, that’s some fine initiative.\c\nI’d be happy to show you the way whenever\nyou’d like to go.\c\nMy Mudsdale here is as sturdy as all get-out.\nShe can easily carry two.[VAR 0114(000B)]

The book that I’m looking for is a very old one.\c\nIt’s a book that contains old myths and legends\nthat Professor Burnet told me about...[VAR 0114(0006)]

What? I mean, yes, it is.\nBut when you say your father...\r\nIsn’t this book...very old?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, it belonged to my dad.\c\nI know I don’t look it, but my family used to be\npretty much royalty.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had to have all my dad’s books moved here\nso they didn’t get ruined by the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I can tell you lots of other old stories about\nAlola, too! You interested?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well...that would be wonderful!\nI would be delighted, if you did.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think I’ll stay here...\nBut I know why you’ve come to Ula’ula.\c\nYou’ll be undergoing another trial, won’t you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Good luck with it.\c\nI read that Ula’ula Island’s Electric-type trial\ncan only be reached by the bus on Route 10.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Ha! [VAR TRNAME(0000)], lemme introduce you.\nThis is Molayne.\c\nHe runs the observatory here and also\nmanages PC Boxes, but he’s not\r\nHokulani’s captain.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I was the captain once, my masked friend.[VAR 0114(001C)]
It’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right? Thanks for coming\nall the way up Hokulani to visit us.\c\nOur Captain Sophocles is a rather busy young\nman, I’m afraid.\c\nAlways calculating comets’ paths or updating\nthat Festival Plaza thing of his...[VAR 0114(001C)]

If you want to be introduced to the Masked\nRoyal, though...\c\nWell, that’s something I could definitely help you\nwith right here and now.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Yeah, I think [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s even stronger than we were\nat this point of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
One more thing, cousin—the name’s Kukui!\nWho’s this Masked Royal you’re talking about?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just...think about that favor I asked you, yeah,\nMolayne? I want you to seriously consider it.\c\nI guess I should head back to Malie Garden.\c\nEven Hau should be done eating malasadas by\nnow, yeah?\c\nI’ll make sure he makes it up here, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That guy’s as interesting as ever. My old buddy![VAR 0114(001C)]
Here’s a little something to remember our\nmeeting by, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(001C)]
Behold![VAR 0114(001C)]
Cutting sharpness!

You summon the Totem Pokémon and prove\nyour strength to it...\c\nThat’s what every trial boils down to, right?[VAR 0114(0010)]
So I thought...\c\nWhy not just call the totem here from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(0010)]
So I tried a bit of this and that, and I think I’ve\nwhipped up a little device to call the\r\nTotem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Perhaps you’re wondering why I built\na machine?\c\nHere at the observatory, we also monitor\nsounds that we detect from outer space.\c\nThere are some sounds that are inaudible to\npeople but Pokémon can hear just fine.[VAR 0114(0010)]
We broadcast the sounds we have gathered\nterrestrially and monitor the reactions\r\nof Pokémon.\c\nThe machine that summons the Totem Pokémon\nmakes use of this technology...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Utilizing other sounds we have gathered, we\nalso developed a security system here...\r\nBut that was actually Big Mo’s invention.[VAR 0114(0010)]

Congratulations on clearing your trial!\c\nAnd you, Sophocles.\nYou did well as captain.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I was really nervous...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
But you were really great, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
Maybe you should invite h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer to check out\nthe Battle Agency in that case![VAR 0114(001C)]
Big Mo! You’re a genius!\nThat’s a marvelous idea![VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nCome with me to one of Festival Plaza’s most\nunique facilities: the Battle Agency![VAR 0114(0010)]
You kids have a good time![VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 10]
I see...\nThen let me reward you![VAR 0114(001C)]
This is one of the Z-Crystals that I collected\nlong ago during my own island challenge to\r\nprove my strength and that of my Pokémon.\c\nSo it seems fitting that it go from me to you.\nTake it, and use it well.[VAR 0114(001C)]
And if we’re done here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nCould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nProfessor Kukui forgot this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
He said he would be going back to Malie Garden.\nCould you take it to him?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Maybe next time we can battle...[VAR 0114(0010)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 252
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Come on! Hurry it up, yo!\nWe’ve gotta get to Malie Garden, quick![VAR 0114(0031)]
Yeah! We’re gonna end that fool Kukui once and\nfor all![VAR 0114(0032)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 253
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How was that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nThe Battle Agency...it’s pretty cool, right?[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 1]
[~ 2]
Well, if you’re done here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\ncould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nMy pal Kukui seems to have forgotten this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
He said he’d be going back to Malie Garden,\ndidn’t he?\r\nSorry to ask, but take it to him, would you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Maybe next time we can battle, too...[VAR 0114(0010)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 254
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yo, yo, yo!\nHold up, yo, Mr. Kukui![VAR 0114(0031)]
You say you wanna make a Pokémon League?\nYou got rocks in your skull?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Four turns![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
Bring it on, the both of you! I’ve been\nresearching Pokémon moves, yeah, so I’m\r\nalways ready, oh yeah!\c\nI’ll take you both on in a Battle Royal, and you’ll\nbe down with just a Swift and Incinerate or two!\c\nYou gotta beat the man to be the man, boys![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yo, for real?[VAR 0114(0031)]
F-fine! You asked for it![VAR 0114(0032)]
Get ’em good, Professor!
You numskulls should learn your place!
Battle Royal, huh? Nice idea there, Kukui.\nYou can beat down three Pokémon at\r\nonce, huh?[VAR 0114(0030)]
It’s Guzma...
The boss has graced us with his presence![VAR 0114(0031)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 255
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hated boss who beats you down, and beats\nyou down, and never lets up...\r\nYeah. Big bad Guzma is here![VAR 0114(0017)]
Greetings, cowering public![VAR 0114(0017)]
We have an exciting bout for you tonight! In the\nopposing corner, the Pokémon professor Kukui!\r\nAnd in this corner, the boss of Team Skull and\r\nthe hardest guy around, Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 256
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here we are, Kukui...\c\nFellow rejects who never could\nbecome captains.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We’ve got all these moldy old\ntraditions in Alola—the kahunas, the captains...\c\nIt’s about time we cut out all that silly garbage\nand make something new for ourselves.\r\nTrust me, I get that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Don’t get me wrong, though, Kukui.\nWe’ve got no need for a Pokémon League.\c\nAfter all, everyone already knows who the\nstrongest Trainer is on these islands![VAR 0114(0017)]
Speak for yourself, Guzma.\c\nIt’s not like I couldn’t become a captain.\nI chose not to. I had other dreams, see?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wanted to figure out which moves would\nbe strong enough to beat old Hala...\r\nand I finally found what I was looking for.\c\nThe strongest moves you can use are the ones\na Trainer and their Pokémon choose together...\r\nin the heat of the moment, when it really counts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s when I knew I had to make a Pokémon\nLeague, yeah, to give everybody a chance to be\r\npushed to the limit with their team and find that\r\nperfect move!\c\nLet’s see it, Guzma! Show me your moves and\nprove you aren’t just all talk!\c\nIf you really can, that is...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right
What?
So you’re one of the kids on h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser island\nchallenge? You don’t look like you’re from\r\naround here![VAR 0114(0017)]
This here’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe just moved to Alola recently.\c\nDiscovery! New experiences! Adventure!\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s loving every minute of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR PKNAME(0001)] can\nunleash some real powerful moves.\c\nSo if you think you’re the strongest Trainer on\nthese islands, Guzma, why don’t you battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Tch! This move fanatic is getting me all riled up![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve got a Z-Power Ring, huh, kid?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Why even bother with the island challenge?\nWhat’s the point of it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
It’ll make me strong
That’s what I want to find out
No it won’t, you dumb kid!\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
Ha! You don’t even know why you’re doing it.\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
Guzma!!!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nNow’s the time for your vaunted team to let\nloose and destroy everything![VAR 0114(0017)]
It was [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nI’ll remember you...as someone I’ll be happy\nto beat down anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
Don’t mess with the boss, yo!\nYou don’t want him to get serious![VAR 0114(0031)]
So you’re Hau, huh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you’re Guzma...? So?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Y’know you don’t have to do this island\nchallenge thing just because your granddad’s\r\na kahuna.\c\nEven if you finish, you might not get what\nyou want.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Team Skull will have to go lick their wounds now!\nGetting beat by a child just doing h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser trials!
Aue, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou are one righteous Trainer!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 257
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Woo, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Those were some nice moves!\nI can feel my soul shaking![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh yeah! I almost forgot to give you something\nsuper important!\c\nHere you go, cousin. This is the Z-Crystal for\n[VAR PKNAME(0002)]...\r\nThe Evolution of the [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\r\nyou chose![VAR 0114(0005)]
And, uh, about that mask you’ve got there,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nMolayne gave you that, yeah?\c\nI’ll take it, if you don’t mind. I can make sure it\ngets back to the Masked Royal safe and sound...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You handed the mask to the professor!
You saw that, too, yeah, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Uh, yeah, I did!\c\nThat was an awesome battle, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Maybe someday Guzma’ll figure out what\nit is you kids learn on the island challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what happened to Lillie?\nYou guys lose her somewhere?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m right here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And so is Acerola![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 11]
You and the professor fought those horrible\nTeam Skull thugs, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nJust thinking about it makes me worry...\r\nThey sound like a scary group...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You think? I don’t know. Exchanging a few\nmoves in battle is the quickest way to get to\r\nknow someone in my book.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I’m going to head up Mount Lanakila.\c\nI’ve gotta make sure the Pokémon League gets\nfinished and everybody has the chance to find\r\ntheir own perfect move!\c\nKeep training hard on your island challenge.\nOne day the two of you’ll make it there, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], Hau...\nbe sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou made it through Sophocles’s trial, huh?\c\nThat’s really great!\nYou can take on the next trial up past Route 11.\r\nThrough Tapu Village, you know?\c\nIf you get lost on your way, ask a police officer\nfor directions. They’re here to serve, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, Lillie, you’re coming with me to do\nsome shopping![VAR 0114(0011)]
You remember what my gramps told us?\c\nHe said we’d meet Pokémon and people on our\njourney that’d enrich our lives, yeah?\c\nI mean...I’m having a good time on my journey,\nfor sure, but...maybe that’s not enough?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Greetings, trial-goer.\c\nLet me check your collection of Z-Crystals.
It looks like you haven’t yet earned your\nElectrium Z, have you?\c\nTake the bus that leaves from Route 10, and\ncomplete the trial that awaits you at the\r\nHokulani Observatory!
Ho! Look at that blinding yellow Electrium Z!
Now I guess I’ll have to open the gate for you!
What you face up ahead is the Ghost-type trial.\nI hope you enjoy it!
Haina Desert...\nIt’s a pretty fun place, don’t you think?
I wonder what Tapu Bulu is thinking, off there\nin Haina Desert...\c\nWhat about Nanu could have made it think that\nhe of all people would make a good kahuna?

Greetings, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well met!\nI was seeking you.\c\nIf you’re going to travel about Ula’ula, you\nought to do it while astride a Mudsdale.\c\nThere is no call for hesitation.\nConsider it my thanks for Akala Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Mudsdale was registered to your Ride Pager!
It was remiss of me not to register her\nfor you when we met one another in Malie.\c\nI was just so taken aback by Lillie and how\nlovely she was that it escaped me.\c\nBy no means was I just waiting for a time when\nyou were in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ni-hiii!
Let me pose a question...\nDo you know of the Ultra Recon Squad?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I keep running into them
I’m sort of helping them
They seem to be here to investigate some ill\nthat weighs heavily upon them.\c\nLuckily, it is quite in keeping with the people\nand Pokémon of Alola to help those in need.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you seek the next trial, go straight\non through here to Tapu Village.\c\nI’ll be cheering for you on your island challenge![VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Phew, that Togedemaru was strong!\nBut I managed to get through the trial, too.\r\nMaybe even managed to get a bit stronger, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I heard from Sophocles how you just breezed\nthrough that trial yourself, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou’re something else!\nI know! You should take this![VAR 0114(0007)]
You only have one volume, don’t you?\c\nHaven’t you ever heard the expression that\nsilence is golden?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gah! He’s back![VAR 0114(0007)]
Listen, Team Skull is looking for a Pokémon\ncalled Cosmog...\c\nDo you two know anything?[VAR 0114(0013)]
What?!\c\nN-not that we’d tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you do know something.\c\nLook...\nCosmog isn’t even a strong Pokémon.\c\nBut it has the potential to summon Pokémon\nso terrifyingly strong that you don’t even know.\c\nIf something like that happened, it would be\na disaster for Alola...[VAR 0114(0013)]
A disaster? Like...a real disaster?\nThen what’re we supposed to do about it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Protect it! If you do know where Cosmog is\nor if you do find anything out...just keep it safe!\c\nI know I might be working for Team Skull right\nnow, so you may not trust me or care but...\r\nI’m going to tell you this just once.\c\nYou have to protect Cosmog...\nno matter what![VAR 0114(0013)]
I still don’t even understand how Team Skull\nfound out about Cosmog in the first place...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do you mean? No matter what?\nYou just gonna leave us hanging?![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nIf they’re really looking for Cosmog, then...\nIs Lillie gonna be OK?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’ve\njust got to keep both of them safe, right?!\c\nThen I know what I’m gonna do.\nTake on the next trials to train with my partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
Look, I know Guzma was saying all those things,\nbut I really wanna complete my island challenge\r\nand help people learn about Pokémon battling!\c\nAnd, I dunno, I’ve gotta make sure I really get\nwhat my partner’s feeling, too![VAR 0114(0007)]

Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
Oh, hey! Um, if you’ve got one to spare...\nthink you could front me a Fresh Water?
Oh! Thanks, friend!\nHere, let me give you these in return.\c\nThey’re Adrenaline Orbs.\c\nDon’t you feel like the Pokémon that other\nPokémon call to help them in battle are, like,\r\nstronger? And even more likely to be Shiny?
My partner is a Poliwhirl with the Water Absorb\nAbility, so it loves a little dousing now and then.
Well, thanks for wanting to help!\nBut it looks like you don’t have a Fresh Water.\c\nIf you remember me, hopefully you can bring me\none next time you’re passing through here!
I get it! Your Fresh Waters are precious to you.\c\nBut if you remember me, maybe you can bring\nan extra for me next time!
Po...

Phew... Look, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nSeems like we’re almost to the Aether House,\nwhere the captain is supposed to be, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
So that way lies Mount Lanakila, huh?\c\nI guess they’re really making a Pokémon League\nup there on the peak...[VAR 0114(0007)]
The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues\nin other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers\r\nin them that they call the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0007)]
The Elite Four and our island kahunas...\nI wonder which ones are stronger!\r\nI’m pretty sure my gramps is the strongest, but\r\nI can’t wait to find out for sure![VAR 0114(0007)]

Hey! Alola![VAR 0114(0007)]
An Alola to you![VAR 0114(0037)]
So this is Tapu Village!\nWe will need to investigate it quite thoroughly.\c\nAccording to the records we have left to us,\nit seems that this is where Necrozma battled\r\nagainst the tapu when it came to Alola long ago,\r\nhungering for its light.[VAR 0114(0036)]
It may be the case that the power which came\npouring out of the Ultra Wormhole at that time\r\nis what changes Pokémon’s regular moves into\r\nZ-Moves. Such theories have been suggested...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Our ancestors were greedy, and they sought to\ncontrol all of Necrozma’s light...\c\nBut what was the result of all that?\nThey only hurt Necrozma, making it lose a part\r\nof itself and causing it to run wild and steal all\r\nthe light it could find![VAR 0114(0036)]
That’s why we have Necrozma cooped up in\nthe Megalo Tower our great ancestors built.\r\nIt contains Necrozma in its rage.[VAR 0114(0037)]
But that facility has reached its limit...\c\nAnd Necrozma hungers for light...\c\nThat is why we came to Alola in hopes of finding\na new method to defeat Necrozma. Yet...[VAR 0114(0036)]
It seems it will be a difficult mission for us, who\nare so new to Pokémon battling, to ever hope to\r\ndefeat Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0036)]
An alola to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Hau.[VAR 0114(0038)]
So, this is Tapu Village...\nWe must learn all we can about this place.\c\nIt seems there are many stories in its past, but\nonce, long ago, the Blinding One battled against\r\nthe tapu in this spot.[VAR 0114(0039)]
It’s thought the power that came pouring\nout of the Ultra Wormhole at that time may be\r\nthe source of Z-Moves’ power...\c\nYes, the light that the Blinding One...\c\nI mean, the light that Necrozma can wield.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Our ancestors were greedy, though.\c\nThey sought to control all of Necrozma’s light...\c\nThey hurt Necrozma...\c\nThey left it incomplete, and in such a state,\nit went mad with fury...\c\nAnd so our light was stolen by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Our world is at peace now thanks to the Megalo\nTower, which keeps the Blinding One contained.\r\nBut we believe the tower is reaching its limit.\c\nAnd the Blinding One...\nNecrozma hungers for light. [VAR 0114(0038)]
The Blinding One may run wild in its fury, but it\ndid also give us light once.\c\nSo we would like to help restore the Blinding\nOne to its true form.\c\nBut we do not have even the slightest idea\nof how we can do that.[VAR 0114(0039)]
If you learn anything that you think might help,\nwill you share it with us?\c\nAfter all, you are far more familiar with the\nZ-Moves than we are.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I don’t really get what all that was about...\c\nBut it seems like those Ultra Recon Squad\npeople are in a pretty hopeless spot, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I just wish everybody could be happy and find\nsomething to smile about. Even that Necrozma.\r\nRight, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Strangers!
This means battle!
What? Why?![VAR 0114(0007)]
We’ll protect our home when Acerola’s away!
I tried really hard! I am a kid, you know!
Phew... So I won, yeah?\nThen why’s this little fellow still gnawing on me?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Grrrssssss!
I’m ba-a-ack, everybody![VAR 0114(0011)]
Ha ha ha! Looks like I finished up my shopping\nspree right on time!\c\nYou’ve already met everyone?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh yeah, we met all right...\nIn battle anyway.\c\nBut...\nHey, where’s Lillie?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I left her with Hapu.\nThey should be coming soon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So why don’t we get those trials done first?\nYou did know I’m the captain, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
These ankle biters are starting to grow on me.\c\nI think I might hang out for a while.\nIt’s kinda soothing, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
My trial takes place at the abandoned site\nwhere the supermarket used to be.\c\nWhen you want to go, I’ll meet you out front of\nAether House to show you the way![VAR 0114(0011)]
Everybody lives together with Pokémon here at\nAether House.

If you’ve got some rare Pokémon in there, I’m\ngonna have to take it and make some cash!\c\nEven if it’s not that rare of a Pokémon, I bet\nI could still get paid, yo.

Oh, so we’re following that script, are we?\nA Trainer dashes forward to save the girl, huh?\r\nI’m not gonna let you be the hero in this scene!
When I saw that adorable Drowzee, that was\nenough for me! Later!

Phew...\nThank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I just wanted to go for a stroll on my own,\nto see what it must feel like to be a Trainer...\r\nSo Hapu and I went our separate ways...\r\nbut then Nebby tried to get out of my bag...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Didn’t you! Go on, you little troublemaker...\nYou’d better thank [VAR TRNAME(0000)], too![VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh, and...um.\c\nWhen I was out shopping, I kept thinking about\nhow I wanted to be some help to you during\r\nyour island challenge...and then I saw these.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh, Acerola... \nThank you! I think I might take you up on that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWe can reach my trial site from Tapu Village.\c\nCome on, follow me![VAR 0114(0011)]

The time has finally come, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
So, I guess I should explain what kind of trial\nthis is, huh?[VAR 0114(0011)]
This old building is full of lots of Ghost-type\nPokémon. Did you know?\c\nHere’s where the trial part comes in.\c\nYou’ve got to find the Totem Pokémon of this\nsite and snap a shot of it with a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0011)]
The totem is a bit of a trickster, and it likes to\nplay hide-and-seek and mess around.\c\nIf you take pictures of the other Ghost-type\nPokémon inside, it’ll definitely come out to get\r\nin on the fun and have its photo taken, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
So, if you see something weird happening inside\nthis old place, try to check it out.\c\nI bet you’ll find a Ghost-type Pokémon causing\nthe mischief, so get its photo before it’s gone![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll just borrow your Poké Finder for a sec.\c\nHee hee!\nAnd your Rotom is a Ghost type, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
We just do this, and...[VAR 0114(0011)]
There! I’ve set it up to use a special shooting\nmode just for this trial.\c\nYou’ll only be able to use it at this site, though.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAnd you can’t leave without giving up, too, so\nmake sure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAlso, you can’t leave without giving up, so make\nsure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]

A conveyor belt started moving all by itself!
The conveyor belt is moving all on its own.\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
A shopping cart started moving all on its own!

Those dolls are moving all by themselves!
The dolls are moving all by themselves!\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?

You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]

You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]
The door is locked!
You didn’t do a thing, but the lock clicked open!
Got it! Then do your best![VAR 0114(0011)]
Nothing seems to be wrong with the conveyor\nbelt now...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Nothing seems to be wrong with the shopping\ncart now...
Nothing seems to be wrong with the display of\ndolls now...
Oh no! The Pokémon spotted you!
Let’zzz see here...\c\nLookzzz like you’re supposed to try to find a\nPokémon and snap a shot of ’em with that\r\nPoké Finder, right? Zz-zz-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
Catching the right shot can be tough, huh?\c\nTry to catch a shot of your subject zzzoomed\nin and right in the center of the viewfinder![VAR 0114(0035)]
Looks like some of the Pokémon in thizzz place\nlike to play hide-and-seek, zzz-zzt!\c\nTry to catch sight of ’em with your Poké Finder,\nthen snap a shot when you’ve got them all\r\nzzzoomed in and centered in the frame![VAR 0114(0035)]
...Who are you?
Acerola?
I’m [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Oh... Never mind that.
Looks like you’re done with the trial, right?\nWe should hurry up and leave this place.
I’m not done yet
I’m leaving now!
This place is dangerous.\nYou should give up on your trial and get out.
I’m not done yet
I told you to get out.
I’m not leaving
Get out.
No!
Get out. Get out! Get OUT!\nGET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!!!

Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
A picture was added to your Poké Finder!\c\nThere is a fuzzy image of Mimikyu caught in\nthe picture!
I’m picking up signzzz of some kinda life-form\nfrom behind us, kiddo![VAR 0114(0035)]

Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI can check your pictures right away.\c\nNow let’s see how you did...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yup! That’s Mimikyu all right!\c\nIt’s pretty hard to catch it on film, so this is a\nreally great attempt!\c\nWhich means...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You received a Z-Crystal from Acerola!
You obtained a Ghost-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Ghostium Z is yours!
If you want to use Ghost-type Z-Power, then \nyou’ve got to move like this![VAR 0114(0011)]
And since you passed my trial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nyou now have my permission to catch Pokémon\r\nin the trial site. So, in that old building there.\c\nHere you go![VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type\nPokémon on your team![VAR 0114(0011)]
What’s that?\c\nYou say I was in there and then you went in the\nback room?\c\nOooh, cut it out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’re trying to scare me, huh?\c\nYou’ll have to come up with something a bit\nmore believable than that!\c\nI was here the whole time, and there’s not even\na room in the back of that shop, for starters!\r\nHow gullible do you think I am?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Brrr!\nI feel like I’m getting chicken skin...\c\nLike a chill going through me for some reason...[VAR 0114(0011)]

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou gave up last time in the middle of my\ntrial, huh? [VAR 0114(0011)]

Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet!

If we want to get the Pokémon back...\c\nthen [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has to go to Po Town...\nAll alone? With no backup?\c\nThat’s what they said, but...that’s not fair![VAR 0114(0007)]
Team Skull has taken over Po Town...\nIt’s basically their private playground now.\c\nOh! I know!\c\nIf you’re gonna go, though, try to find this guy\non Route 15 who’s wearing a kimono...\r\nHe might be able to help you get to Po Town.\c\nHe knows a whole lot about Pokémon that can\ntravel across the water.

H-here. Take this...\nJust...just get my Yungoos back for me!
I feel so alone and scared without my Pokémon...\nI can’t sleep at night without her...
You’re gonna help us, aren’t you?\nYou’re strong, right?

I-I’m sorry, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. It’s my fault...\c\nNow you’ve got to put yourself in danger\nbecause...I couldn’t stop them...[VAR 0114(0007)]

Uh-huh...\nI see you’ve got your reasons.[VAR 0114(0030)]

...Astonishing.\nYou just took a stab, like some kind of prophet.\c\nRight now, you and your Pokémon are shining\nbrilliantly.[VAR 0114(0028)]
...Astonishing.\c\nI had indeed been planning to have Skarmory\nsnatch it out of the air as it spun in the sky.[VAR 0114(0028)]
A loss is a loss.\c\nI’ll give you Sharpedo’s info for your Ride Pager\nthen. Ride it to victory.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Sharpedo was registered to your Ride Pager![VAR 0114(0028)]
Maybe you don’t need to hear this from me,\nbut I’m going to tell you anyway.\c\nIf you press  while riding on Sharpedo there,\nit’ll [VAR COLOR(0001)]jet[VAR COLOR(0000)] forward and smash through rocks\r\nlike those ones there.[VAR 0114(0028)]
And here’s a bit more unwanted advice.\c\nPo Town lies at the other end of Route 16 here.\nBut it’s thoroughly occupied by Team Skull.\c\nYou shouldn’t go there unless you want trouble.[VAR 0114(0028)]
If somebody wins a battle, then without doubt,\nsomeone else has lost the battle.\c\nThat’s the way of battle.\nI hope I might battle you someday.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Sometimes you have to lay everything on the\nline in life, and risk it all...\c\nWhen I did that, though, I’m afraid I lost.\nI took to walking along the shore in my despair.\c\nAnd before I even noticed what I was doing,\nI ended up riding Alola’s waves together with\r\nSharpedo and Mantine...\c\nThat’s right... The role I’m meant to play now\nis to teach others what it means to ride...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Champion, huh...\nThat’s a title I haven’t heard in a while.\c\nAllow me to offer my congratulations as a former\nmember of the Unova region’s own Elite Four...\r\nwhen we meet at Poni Island’s Battle Tree![VAR 0114(0028)]

Such awful thugs they are, tormenting poor\nPokémon for no good reason...\r\nI swear I just don’t know what to do with them![VAR 0114(0015)]
And just look at me, would you?\c\nHere I am, taking the initiative to travel Alola on\nmy own to check on how Pokémon are doing.\c\nI’ve been trying to think through this Necrozma\nissue on my own. That sort of noble dedication\r\nis what you would expect of a president, even...\r\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Not that a foolish child could...\c\nAhem.\nI mean, not that I would expect you to know.\c\nAnyhow. Do try to stay safe.\nDon’t say I didn’t warn you about Team Skull.[VAR 0114(0015)]

Whoa, that was, like, so uncool! I’ll get revenge\nfor you...while still wearing your Skull Tank![VAR 0114(0032)]
Ugh! Her Skull Tank was too tight for me! It\nwas so distracting that I lost! It’s all her fault![VAR 0114(0032)]

Oh, Yungoos? How sweet of you to help out a\nsad little girl.\c\nTch![VAR 0114(0017)]

Oh ho...\nIs that right? Is that what you think?[VAR 0114(0015)]

Aether Report: Ultra Wormholes\n\nBeyond the Ultra Wormholes that Professor\nMohn discovered lies a different dimension.\c\nBy investigating the changes in mass there, we\ncan predict the existence of Pokémon-like life.\nWe have dubbed them Ultra Beasts for now.

And that is why!\c\nI knew I would be able to ambush you here,\njust in front of the mansion where the president\r\nremains, and remedy my previous failure.\c\nThe only reason I let you in the lower floor was\nto buy time to gather more staff to stop you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Wow, Mr. Faba!\nYou’re so nice![VAR 0114(0007)]
W-well...of course...\nI am a wonderful branch chief, after all![VAR 0114(0015)]
We didn’t even have to ask you where the\npresident was, and you just confirmed it for us!\c\nSo the president is up ahead, huh?\c\nThanks!\nNow we know where to find Cosmog and Lillie![VAR 0114(0007)]
What?![VAR 0114(0015)]
E-enough!\nYou lot! Teach these children a lesson![VAR 0114(0015)]
We don’t have time for this.\nHelp me out here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
H-h-h-how can this be?\nTo be cornered by mere children?![VAR 0114(0015)]
Maybe helping one another out isn’t so bad...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hau!\nI leave Faba to you![VAR 0114(0013)]
E-enough! I will show you the true power of\nBranch Chief Faba!\c\nThe man who is called Aether Paradise’s\nlast line of defense!\r\nWe will settle this at last with a Multi Battle![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 13]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI know [VAR PKNAME(0001)] and the rest of our\nPokémon feel the same way we do.\r\nWe can save Lillie and Cosmog for sure![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wanna help save Lillie, so I’m going ahead!\nYou don’t mind, right?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Thanks for even giving us the key, Mr. Faba!\nYou’ve been a big help![VAR 0114(0007)]
This is why...\nThis is why I can’t bring myself to like children.[VAR 0114(0015)]

I did that spoiled little brat a favor and crushed\nhim. Yeah, that was me.\c\nY’know, I kinda liked you, kid.

An Alola to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0037)]
It is the custom of your people to have your\nPokémon do battle if your goals are in conflict\r\nwith those of another, isn’t it?\c\nThat is what we have learned during the course\nof our research.[VAR 0114(0036)]
I may not be well practiced in Pokémon battle,\nbut I will make you leave Cosmog to us.\c\nShow h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer your power, Poipole![VAR 0114(0036)]
Even with all our technology, we cannot control\nthe outcome of battle.\c\nThis must be why we are unable to maintain\nperfect control over Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0036)]
You people here in Alola really are something,\nbeing able to make your Pokémon battle and all![VAR 0114(0037)]
But...[VAR 0114(0037)]
Do not fear, Zossie.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We can rely upon the strength of the\nAether Foundation.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We will use Cosmog and send formidable\nPokémon Trainers through the Ultra Wormhole\r\nto battle and defeat Necrozma![VAR 0114(0036)]
That is why we had the scientist Colress create\na device that will be able to restrain Necrozma![VAR 0114(0036)]

It has been some time since we last met,\ntrial-going Trainer.\c\nI do not know if you have learned anything more\nabout the Blinding One, but it seems we might\r\nnow have the means to do what we came to do.\c\nIf a Pokémon caught in a Poké Ball can be made\nto obey the orders of the one who catches it,\r\nthen we should be able to control Necrozma![VAR 0114(0039)]
Pokémon caught in Poké Balls are loyal to the\nTrainers who hold them.\c\nIt should be the same for Necrozma...\c\nSo we will need you to leave us in peace so\nthat we may do our job.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Captain Phyco, they only seem worried for\nCosmog’s safety...[VAR 0114(0038)]
And they are able to use Z-Moves.\nThe power of the Blinding One.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Are you suggesting that we rely on children?\nTo stand against the wild fury of Necrozma?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Is it not kinder to them to stop them here,\nrather than send them against that thing?![VAR 0114(0039)]
I will battle you...\c\nI will battle you with our Pokémon.\nThe Ultra Beast Poipole.[VAR 0114(0038)]
How infuriating.\c\nIt is most unsatisfying to find something that\nour technology cannot overcome![VAR 0114(0039)]
It seems that we might yet be able to resolve\nthis somehow if we could use Z-Power.\r\nAnd yet...\c\nOur expertise when it comes to battling with\nPokémon is so terribly insufficient...[VAR 0114(0039)]
We will find a way to deal with Necrozma.\nYou children should pursue your own dreams.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Don’t end up with the same kinds of regrets\nthat we have...[VAR 0114(0038)]

Y...you came?\c\nYou actually came to help me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nThank you... Thank you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmm.\nSo you know one another?[VAR 0114(0014)]
A gifted young Trainer like [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nAnd [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she bothers with someone like you?[VAR 0114(0014)]
How disappointing.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I don’t need your approval, Mother!\nOr your permission! I will save Cosmog![VAR 0114(0006)]
My...\nYou do say such incomprehensible things.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Calling me mother?\nI don’t have any children!\c\nCertainly not any wretched children who would\nrun off and reject my love![VAR 0114(0014)]
So tell me how you’ll save that Pokémon.\nWhat can you do, Lillie?\c\nYou failed to convince me to listen to you.\nYou don’t even have the strength of a Trainer.\c\nThe only thing that you’ve ever done on your\nown is steal someone else’s research material![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s so terribly unattractive.\c\nBut know that my fathomless love will save\neven someone like you...\r\nwhen I protect this entire world from darkness![VAR 0114(0014)]
Protect this world...?\nMother! What is it you’re trying to do?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Is that why you want Nebby?\nIs that what you would sacrifice Cosmog for?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right... I will force Cosmog to use its\npower, and it may very well die.\c\nBut if it will save the world for all of my beloved\nPokémon, then that is what I will do.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Lillie.\c\nI will be using the Cosmog you stole for a\ngreat purpose.\c\nYou have kept it safe until now, and for that...\nI thank you.[VAR 0114(0014)]

What is this?[VAR 0114(0036)]
That Lusamine!\c\nShe is not defeating Necrozma for our sake,\nbut for her own satisfaction?![VAR 0114(0036)]
Miss President...\nWhy would she do this...?[VAR 0114(0037)]
The machine that the scientist Colress helped\ndevelop with our technology...\r\nThe machine that would restrain Necrozma...\c\nWe were going to send it back to our world with\nsomeone strong enough to safely use it, but...\r\nshe is going to use it for herself?![VAR 0114(0036)]
The words we just heard...\nIs that the truth?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Lusamine...\nWhat kind of human is she?!\c\nShe acted so kind and caring, and yet beneath\nthe surface, she thought of none but herself?![VAR 0114(0039)]
Was this all for her own selfish satisfaction?\nOr does she simply feel too much responsibility\r\nto take everything upon herself to fix?\c\nWhat is she thinking?\nWhat an incomprehensible individual...\r\nThough that is much as we had heard.[VAR 0114(0038)]
In truth, we are not strong.\c\nWe have not needed to be. We use technology\nto resolve any problem that arises in our lives.\c\nThat is why we had discussed finding some\nhuman we could send through to our world to\r\nbattle with Pokémon on our behalf.[VAR 0114(0039)]
What was that you just said?!\c\nYou said you were going to send someone back\nto your world?\c\nDo you know some other way to open an\nUltra Wormhole?![VAR 0114(0013)]
The altar on Poni...\c\nThe Pokémon that appears there is called the\nbeast that devours the sun.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We rode on the back of a Pokémon like that!\nThat’s how we got here to Alola![VAR 0114(0037)]
Lusamine and Guzma...\c\nDo they not understand how strong Necrozma\ntruly is?\c\nOr do they go to fight it, even knowing that?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Mister Trainer...and all of you...\c\nIf Necrozma awakens, it will come to steal the\nlight from Alola.\r\nYou must protect your world’s light!\c\nAlola is so brilliant and nice![VAR 0114(0037)]
Miss Trainer...and all of you...\c\nIf Necrozma awakens, it will come to steal the\nlight from Alola.\r\nYou must protect your world’s light!\c\nAlola is so brilliant and nice![VAR 0114(0037)]
I have a difficult time with such brilliance, but\nthe light of Alola...is a good thing.\c\nThe aura of your totems...\nAnd, yes, even the light of your Z-Powers.\c\nBut now, if you’ll excuse us...[VAR 0114(0036)]
The altar on Poni...\c\nThe Pokémon that appears there is known as\nthe beast that calls the moon.[VAR 0114(0039)]
We borrowed such a brute’s power ourselves to\ncome here to Alola.[VAR 0114(0038)]
But to think that those two hope to capture\nNecrozma on their own...\c\nDo the people of this world truly have so much\nconfidence in their strength in Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0039)]
If Necrozma awakens...it will hunger for light.\nAnd it will descend upon Alola to take it.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Our world...\c\nUltra Megalopolis is a world without any light\nleft in it, after all.[VAR 0114(0038)]
We know that the darkness that once fell\nupon Alola was driven back with light...\r\nThat is what the old legends and myths tell us.\c\nBut in all our investigations, we still have not\nlearned what that light was exactly.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Of course it is!\nAfter all, the beasts are real.\c\nI’m sure we can find it.\nWe’ll find the Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
Everything’ll be fine

I will give it everything I have!\nI’ll find my own kind of Z-Power![VAR 0114(0006)]

But...what are you going to do, Gladion?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Deal with this mess.\nI’ve got to clean up Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0013)]
All I wanted was to be able to protect\neverybody, together with Null...\c\nMaybe I couldn’t do that, but I’ll make sure that\nthis place at least stays safe.\r\nThe foundation that our mother loved...[VAR 0114(0013)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey, and it’s Lillie...isn’t it?!\c\nWhat happened to you?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Yes, it’s me!\nNow I’m ready to use my full force, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re all...amazing!\c\nThat’s it! I’ve decided![VAR 0114(0007)]
What?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I keep getting saved by [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and\nmy partner [VAR PKNAME(0001)], right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I keep being like this and I don’t change,\nthen I’m gonna get left behind by you all.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I really wanted to save Lillie and Cosmog!\c\nWhen my partner and I both felt that way and\nwe were in sync, we were so much stronger...\r\nThat’s how it felt to me. So...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m gonna try to chase that feeling down again,\ntogether with [VAR PKNAME(0001)] and my team![VAR 0114(0007)]
So our family drama ended up changing the\nkind of Trainer you want to be...\r\nSorry for getting you dragged into our mess.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Sure, you might’ve been a part of it...\c\nBut in the end, the only one who’s gonna make\nme change is me.\c\nAnd besides, Miss Lusamine is out there trying\nto keep Alola safe, right?\r\nI knew she was a good person![VAR 0114(0007)]
I guess...\c\nShe’s always convinced that what she’s doing\nis right, and she’s really kind of selfish, but...\c\nBut...I think she really just wanted to find our\nfather, who disappeared into an Ultra Wormhole.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hau...\c\nThank you for your kind words.\nI’m really happy you feel that way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I can get you to the next island at least.\nPoni Island.\c\nI’ll wait for you at the docks.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s show the world what we can really do![VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess I should wish you guys a good trip, huh?\c\nI’m gonna train up myself and my team real good\nbefore I see you again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nBe ready for the shock of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0007)]

Poni Island...\c\nAlmost no one lives on it, but you’ll find a whole\nlot of nature to explore here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Go. Find the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The kahuna of Poni Island also protects the\naltar where Alola’s people worship the\r\nLegendary Pokémon.\c\nMaybe they will know something that might\nhelp you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gladion...\c\nthank you for this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m glad that I finally know why you left. And\nthat you were trying to help Mother and Father.\c\nBut if you’d just told me that back then...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sorry...\c\nAll I could think about in those days was how\nNull and I had to be stronger...\c\nBut we’ll use the strength that we found to\nprotect the foundation in Mother’s place.\r\nThis will be your battle now.\r\nI know you can handle it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’m OK. You don’t have to worry.\r\nI know what I have to do now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And...\c\nI don’t know. Maybe it sounds strange, but...\c\nI’m kind of excited.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Welcome![VAR 0114(0030)]
Nice to see a new face around here![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh my goodness![VAR 0114(0006)]
I-I’m sorry. Who are you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m Mina.\nI’m the local captain.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Me? I’m the chief of the seafolk.\nIt’s my job to keep everybody together.
Captain...Mina?\nIt’s nice to meet you then...[VAR 0114(0006)]
So let’s get right down to things.\nWhich one of you is here for my trial?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes, ma’am!\c\nWhat’d you think all these boats ’round\nyou are here for?
We seafolk have spent years navigating the\nseas and searching out new wonders.\c\nWhen we find rare things, we bring ’em here\nto Alola to trade.
The ports on the other islands are busier\nthese days, but we still always seem to end\r\nup back here on Poni, eh?
What did you all come here for?\nYou collecting Berries, like us? 
Oh! No, that’s not why we’re here![VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, you’re not entirely wrong.\nIt’s true that [VAR TRNAME(0000)] is in the middle\r\nof h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser island challenge, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
we’re here to meet the kahuna of this island![VAR 0114(0006)]
The kahuna?\c\nOh... Well, that’s a problem.\nMaybe you should talk to Hapu?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hmm... Lillie seems like the type that’s hard to\nreally capture in a drawing, know what I mean?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The kahuna? Hmm.\c\nMaybe you should go to little Hapu’s place?\c\nHer house is the only one still standing on Poni,\nafter all. Where else would you go, eh?
You can recognize little Hapu’s house at a\nglance...thanks to that huge Mudsdale of hers.
Oh! So Hapu lives here on Poni Island?\c\nThank you very much, Captain Mina![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIt will be good to see Hapu and Mudsdale again![VAR 0114(0006)]
M-modeling, is it?\c\nDoes that mean I’m not allowed to move even an\ninch until you return from Exeggutor Island?\r\nI hope you’ll hurry back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Lipper!

I’ll be fine! I’ve got Max Repels with me.\c\nAnd I’ve got you, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Poni Island...\nIt’s a completely different kind of island, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]

It’s good to see you again, too, Mudsdale!\nYou look to be in fine form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow...\nPokémon Trainers really do amaze me.\c\nIt seems like a hard path to walk, and even so,\nyou don’t let yourself be held back by the fear\r\nof seeing your Pokémon friends get hurt...\c\nYou just keep striving forward together...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! Been a while, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAnd you brought Lillie along, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes. It’s good to see you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
You look different...like you’re ready to go all out\nin something now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you, Hapu.\nI’ve finally discovered what I need to do.\r\nSo this is my Z-Powered form![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! Then you do your best, Lillie.[VAR 0114(000B)]
No one could call you lily-livered![VAR 0114(000B)]
Um, so, Hapu...do you know where we can find\nthe kahuna?[VAR 0114(0006)]
The kahuna?\c\nHrmm.\nDon’t have one here on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now what do we do, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, do not be distressed. I wouldn’t say\nthat I know nothing of this.[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right. Let us all proceed to the ruins.\nYou stick with me, you two.[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nwe just have to keep going, right!\c\nBut then again...you are a Trainer, aren’t you?\nI suppose you always keep moving forward![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Eek![VAR 0114(0006)]
I-I’m sorry. I don’t think we’ve been introduced...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho ho ho!\nI’m Hapu’s old gran.\c\nAre you two friends with my girl?
Yes, we are
How did you guess?
Ho ho ho!\nSo she has friends now!
Ho ho ho!\nYou’d tease an old woman, eh?
Traveling around the islands...\nmaking new friends...\r\nYou kids are luckier than you know.
If you want to head for the Poni Island ruins,\nhow about a bit of help from this old gran?\r\nHere. Hand over your Ride Pager a moment.
Machamp was registered to your Ride Pager!
[~ 12]
You’ll need to move some big obstacles to make\nit down the path that you two hope to travel.
I wish you both a brilliant future.
My Hapu was heading for the Ruins of Hope,\nwasn’t she? Go after her.\c\nFirst, you’ll come to Poni Breaker Coast.\nYou’ll know it by the soil—it’s black as pitch.\r\nGo through there, and you’ll find the ruins.
Thank you very much, ma’am!\nYou have been a great help![VAR 0114(0006)]
The Ruins of Hope...\c\nthat is where the guardian of Poni Island will be.\nThat is where Tapu Fini lives.\c\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
I wonder what kind of kahuna my little Hapu\nwill become.\c\nI hope she won’t worry too much about how her\nold granddad did things and find her own path.

The Ruins of Hope...[VAR 0114(0006)]
What is this place...?\nThe air feels so oppressive...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But...but if we go in there...\c\nmaybe Nebby will return to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
The people believe that the guardian deity of\nthese ruins, Tapu Fini, can wash away any\r\nimpurities with its mystic water...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That sounds promising
You think that’ll work?
That’s right it does, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to give it my all so that we can return\nNebby back to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, honestly, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to make sure that Nebby gets right\nback to normal, just to show you![VAR 0114(0006)]
So just you wait, Nebby!\c\nThis time I’m going to be the one who saves you![VAR 0114(0006)]

If we’re going to break a path, we’ll need to\nmove these huge rocks![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s what Hapu’s grandmother said, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Unghhh![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t think I can do this...\nI-it’s heavier than words can even express...[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll have to borrow Machamp’s formidable\nstrength for this task.\c\nI read about it once in a book.\nIf I remember right, it said...\c\n“When getting a ride from a powerful Machamp,\nTrainers can activate Machamp’s [VAR COLOR(0001)]Shove[VAR COLOR(0000)] by\r\nstanding before a rock and pressing !”\c\nAnd if we find ourselves getting frustrated,\nwe should probably remember to step outside\r\nagain for a bit of perspective.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When Hapu spoke of an “odd little thing” from\nthe sky...do you think she meant a beast?\c\nWhat do you think Hapu brought us here for?\c\nSo many of the things that Trainers do are\nstill a mystery to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]

I’ve read about them, you know...\c\nAlola’s sacred ruins...and the guardian deities\nworshipped within them.\c\nThey go wherever they want, so it’s not easy to\nmeet them...according to the books I’ve read.\c\nBut if they are summoned here at the ruins,\nthey do sometimes appear.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The books say that they are, well, capricious.\c\nEncounters with them do not always end as\nyou hope they will.\c\nMaybe that explains why...\c\neven coming here to these ruins hasn’t evoked\nany response from Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! There’s Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]

As kahuna, I will do my best for the people...

Oh! So you two were watching?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon we\nworship here in Alola—our sacred guardians.\c\nThey are chosen from among the people living\non the island each guardian watches over.\c\nLillie told me that you’re pretty new to our parts,\neh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nYou came to Alola from far off?\c\nYou must really be something then.\c\nI heard how you were given a Sparkling Stone\nby the tapu, even as a stranger to our shores.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My grandfather...\c\nMy grandfather was also chosen for this honor.\nThe honor of being our island’s kahuna.\c\nBut he died suddenly some years back,\nand we were left without a kahuna on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I tried to follow in his footsteps, but I was not\nchosen by the tapu back then.\c\nSo I set out on my own sort of island challenge,\ntraveling Alola and trying to grow stronger.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Lillie.\c\nThe kahuna you wished to meet is right here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
O-oh! Of course!\c\nThen please, Kahuna Hapu!\nTell me about the Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
So you want to know about Solgaleo, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Sunne?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So you want to know about Lunala, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Moone?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I must go after my mother!\nShe disappeared off into some far-off world...\c\nAnd a fearsome creature lives in that world.\nA Pokémon called Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why I want to ask the Legendary\nPokémon for its help...\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is the only one\nwho can go back and forth between worlds![VAR 0114(0006)]
A world where beasts reside, eh...\c\nI reckon that must be the kind of world you find\nat the other end of those holes that open up in\r\nthe sky, just as my grandfather once described.[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right.\nI will tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, thank you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
But what I know is not much.\c\nJust that there is a ceremony held for the\nLegendary Pokémon at the altar.\c\nA ceremony that uses two particular flutes to\nsomehow give the Legendary Pokémon power.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is the Moon Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is the Sun Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! That looks to be the flute that used to\nreside at the lake on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The other is said to be held on Exeggutor Island.\c\nI do not know why there of all places, but it has\nbeen passed down that that’s where it belongs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Exeggutor Island...\nI think I’ve read about it before.\c\nIt’s an uninhabited island off the coast of Poni,\nisn’t that right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes. And no reason to dally here.\nLet us go and speak with Mina.\c\nLillie, you take Mudsdale.\nWe proceed to Seafolk Village![VAR 0114(000B)]

Thank you, Hapu!\nAnd thank you, Mudsdale![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s what friends do.[VAR 0114(000B)]

I am so glad I got to meet you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
To journey to Exeggutor Island, you should\nspeak with Mina.\r\nShe can help arrange a boat for you.\c\nI shall be wishing for your safety![VAR 0114(000B)]

Little Hapu was?\c\nWe’ve been having old man Nanu look after our\ngrand trials up until now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Heh! Now we’ve got our own little kahuna!\nThat’s great![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 5]
Yes.\nHapu will do her best for her late grandfather...\c\nas I must do my best for my mother’s sake.\nAnd for Nebby, as well.\c\nA-and so!\nThere’s a place that we need to go.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Exeggutor Island
To find the flute
Exeggutor Island?\nOh, where the flute is... Right![VAR 0114(0012)]
Where the flute is...?\nOh! You mean Exeggutor Island, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, in that case, we’d better get the chief![VAR 0114(0012)]
Did you call me?![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh my goodness![VAR 0114(0006)]
Nice to meet you.\c\nI’m the chief of the seafolk.\c\nI couldn’t help overhearing what you said.\nSo why don’t I get you to Exeggutor Island?
Oh, thank you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hold up there, little lady!\c\nIt’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)] who will go on this trip.\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe is a Trainer, after all.\c\nAnd Exeggutor Island is a pretty crazy place...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ha, that’s true!\nThere are some crazy critters on that island!\c\nIt’s one thing for a Trainer to go, but if you’re\nnot a Trainer, you should just trust your friend\r\nto take care of this task for you.
But...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve got this!
You just wait here
You’re right. I’m sure you and [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\ncan handle it better than anyone else could.\r\nI’ll wait here for you to come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
And while we’re waiting for [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI’ll make you model for a picture, Lillie![VAR 0114(0012)]
Exeggutor Island...?\nOh, you mean where the flute is!
To find the flute?\nOh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
Well, you two did meet the kahuna already...\c\nand Poni’s captain ain’t around anyway, so\nI guess there’s no point waiting on any trials...
All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there,\nand you’ll think you’re sailing in a dream!

Hm? Looks like the fellows are even more\nworked up than usual.\c\nEh. But they’re always a noisy bunch.\nIt’s probably fine.
You go on. Good luck!
You want to go back to Poni Island?
Fair enough. Let’s be going.
I’ll wait around for you then.
Let’s go find that flute! Right?\c\nTrainers really can go anywhere as long as\nthey have their Pokémon, can’t they?\r\nI think I’m beginning to understand the appeal.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You want to head back to Exeggutor Island?
You wanna go to Exeggutor Island, that perfect\nparadise for Exeggutor?
Well, all right then. Let’s be going!
Fair enough. Maybe next time!

Ahhh!\nWhat is that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]

Rain in Alola, huh...\c\nMy skirt got a bit wet...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looking out at the rain like this...\nreminds me of this one time when I was little.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’d seen it in a movie...\c\nthis man singing and dancing in the rain.\c\nIt captivated me so much that I had to try it\nfor myself.\c\nMy mother spotted me out in the rain, and she\nwas so shocked that she ran right out after me\r\nwithout even bothering to get an umbrella...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And then...she smiled...\nand she danced with me in the rain.\c\nOf course we both ended up catching cold.\c\nShe let me sleep in her big bed with her.\nI was so happy that I kept waking her again\r\nand again, just to be sure it wasn’t a dream...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But...\c\nthen she changed.\c\nAnd all she would think about was the\nUltra Beasts.\c\nAnd Null and Nebby...\c\nThey both ended up suffering so much...\nand I couldn’t do anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But you know what, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nWhenever I feel like there’s nothing I can do,\nyou seem to show up and...you do something.\c\nEvery time, you’ve shown me that it’s possible...\nto do something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Even the first time we met...\c\nNebby was being attacked, and all I could do\nwas look on in horror...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And at Aether Paradise...\c\nall I could do was wait for you and the\nothers to save me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Whenever I’m in any sort of trouble, you’re\nalways there...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Fill my Pokédex
Get stronger
I don’t know
It must be nice, knowing what you want to do.\nI really admire that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, thank goodness...\c\nIt’s such a relief to know that even someone\nlike you feels unsure at times, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I think...I’d like to become a Trainer, too.\nAnd travel together with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I want to become a Trainer, and learn all the\nthings you know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]

A flute is placed on a very old pedestal...
Will you take the flute?
You obtained the Sun Flute!
You obtained the Moon Flute!
Now we have both the Sun Flute and the\nMoon Flute![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t know if it will really summon the\nLegendary Pokémon, but we can at least try!\c\nIf nothing else, we’ll have sounded the flutes in\noffering like people used to do.\c\nSo thank you for coming this far with me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go meet the chief of the seafolk and\nget back to Poni Island![VAR 0114(0006)]

Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now you’ve got to play those flutes up at the\naltar, I guess.\c\nThe altar can be found in the deepest part of\nthe Vast Poni Canyon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Those Exeggutor sure took a liking to you.\c\nYou’ve clearly got something important in you,\nas a Trainer, if Pokémon like you that much.

Here they come![VAR 0114(0031)]
You’re from Team Skull.\nWhat is it that you want from us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I heard about you numskulls at Aether.\c\nDo you really know how to open an Ultra\nWormhole and save our boy Guzma?![VAR 0114(0031)]
Lemme see if you really are bad to\nthe bone enough to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0032)]
OK, no bones about it—you’re way stronger\nthan me![VAR 0114(0032)]
Doesn’t matter! We’ll come after you with all our\nPokémon at once then, li’l home slice!\c\nWe’ll give 500 percent to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0031)]
I may have lost, but listen up, yo! Please save\nGuzma for us![VAR 0114(0031)]
You dummies.\c\nThey’re trying to save the boss, so what do you\nwanna get in their way for?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hmmph. You, girlie...\c\nLillie, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You really ready to do this finally?[VAR 0114(0018)]
To be honest, I’ve treated you really badly.\c\nEven if I was just doing the work the president\ntold me to do, I shouldn’t have done all that.\c\nEven if I apologize now, I know it’s probably too\nlate for you to forgive me, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
See, Guzma...\c\nhe really likes the president.\c\nShe’s the only adult who ever seemed to see\nhow strong he was.[VAR 0114(0018)]
The president...\c\nMy mother is—\nShe’s selfish.\c\nShe decides all by herself what she thinks\nneeds to be done to make other people happy,\r\nnot even caring what it is they may want...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But people ought to help one another out!\nThat is what I have learned here in Alola!\r\nAnd that is what I’m going to teach her, too.\c\nThen I think we can save Mr. Guzma.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know...deep down, you’re kind of like\nthe president.\c\nYou’ve gone in a different direction, but I can tell\nyou have the same strength in your convictions.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Lillie...\nI know you’ve got no reason to help, but...\c\nBut could you help us save Guzma?[VAR 0114(0018)]
That big dummy...\nI don’t think he’s even aware of it, but...\c\nAlola really means a lot to him. That’s why he’s\ndoing something so reckless to try to save it.[VAR 0114(0018)]
The Poison-type Z-Crystal...\nMaybe it’ll help you somehow.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I guess giving you this Z-Crystal is also kind of,\nwhat did you call it, helping each other?\c\nOh yeah...\c\nYou got your first stone directly from Tapu\nKoko, didn’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nYou’d better take care of it. That’s one special\nZ-Power Ring you’ve got there.[VAR 0114(0018)]
A Trainer is only a Trainer because of the\nPokémon with them.\c\nIf you ever forget that, you’ll bring the wrath\nof the tapu down upon yourself.\c\nYou should be fine, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m out of here.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I suppose even Team Skull is not all bad...\c\nThanks for helping me again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nAnd here, let me thank your team, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s finally go to the altar!\c\nThe Vast Poni Canyon lies ahead of us![VAR 0114(0006)]

Did everything go well?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I had to have [VAR TRNAME(0000)] do everything for\nme yet again, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nothing wrong with that, Lillie.\c\nPeople cannot survive all on their own.\nThey have got to help one another out.\c\nSame for Pokémon, too.\c\nThat is what my grandfather used to say.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ni-hiii!
It’s that kindness of yours, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nthat keeps that brilliant smile on Lillie’s face.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Please wait.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We have been betrayed by Lusamine...\c\nAnd now we are expected to put our faith in a\nchild like you next?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Even if we are still weak, we have also\nlearned to do battle with Pokémon...\c\nWe should be the ones to resolve the situation\nwith Necrozma ourselves![VAR 0114(0036)]
I will defeat you, and we will handle things with\nour own power this time![VAR 0114(0036)]
Can we not stand up against the long history\nof a region like Alola, where the culture of\r\nPokémon battling has had so long to develop?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Mm-hmm. The people of Alola get along and get\nto know each other through Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Please wait.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Just as you use your own strength to overcome\nthe trials before you...\c\nperhaps it is time that we stop relying on others\nand instead take matters into our own hands.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Now that we have learned to do Pokémon\nbattle ourselves, I think we might be able to\r\nresolve the situation with Necrozma on our own.[VAR 0114(0039)]
If I am strong enough, then we can do it.\nIf I am only strong enough to defeat you![VAR 0114(0039)]
This is...astounding!\c\nYou show such skill for drawing forth the\npower from your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0039)]
Yes...\c\nThe people of Alola battle their Pokémon\nagainst one another to learn more about each\r\nother, after all.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Greetings.\nI am the kahuna of this island. Hapu.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You are from the beasts’ world, are you not?\c\nWe in Alola have long lived together with our\nPokémon, being aided by them to survive.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you are in some sort of trouble, then we will\ngladly come to your aid however we can.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That is most generous of you...[VAR 0114(0036)]
When Necrozma comes, then...will you battle it?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Then I will throw myself upon your generosity,\nin spite of our own shortcomings.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Please.\c\nWhen Necrozma comes to attack this world,\nwill you fight it in our place?[VAR 0114(0038)]
[~ 25]

This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu!\c\nI will battle you with everything that I have got![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ahaha! Now, don’t be hasty, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLook at the state of your Pokémon.\c\nWe have got to have them in peak condition for\nthis to be a fair fight.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oho...\nYou sure showed me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That was enjoyable.\c\nLooks like I cannot beat you even when I am not\nholding back...\c\nI appreciate this chance, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt has really taught me a few things.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Take your Ground-type Z-Crystal then...\nThis Groundium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000B)]
I will teach you the pose, too, so eyes up here![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
Phew...\c\nWell, I must applaud you, Lillie. You sure found\na prodigious Trainer to befriend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then go on with you two!\nHead straight through here and find the altar![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well then!\nThe path to the shrine is through the canyon.\c\nYou will find other Trainers in this place, though.\nThey come for training. It will be a tough road.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You will have to pitch in, too, Lillie.\c\nBut if you two end up in any real trouble,\nMudsdale and I will hasten to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you, Hapu.\nI will do all I can to help [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Come!\c\nIf you want to proceed to that canyon, you will\nhave to get through me and my grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]
First we must accept these people and beasts\nfrom other worlds into our hearts.\c\nThat is how we do things here in Alola.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I wonder if a Trainer would even be able to\nbefriend a beast like Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0037)]
What is it that we should do?\nMust we start by putting our faith in you?[VAR 0114(0039)]

The vast canyon...\nI wonder what we will find ahead.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And what a mysterious statue...\nDo you think it means something?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, yes! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHere, take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s a Max Revive I found in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When I—\c\nOnce I am ready, I am going to come after you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I am going to catch up to you.\c\nFor Nebby’s sake...\nand for my mother’s sake, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, yes...\nBut let me first make sure that [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\r\n[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,1D06)]is alland the rest of your team are ready for battle![VAR 0114(0006)]

Phew...\nThis canyon truly is a difficult path to walk.\c\nAnd you even make the Vast Poni Canyon seem\nlike nothing at all, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
This bridge reminds me of the first time that I\nmet you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’d taken Nebby with me, but I didn’t have the\ncourage to protect it myself...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I couldn’t do anything...\nBut I’m not that person anymore![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I did it!\nI made it all the way across![VAR 0114(0006)]
Someday...\c\nI’d like to be more like you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI want to fight together with Pokémon and\nbecome strong enough to outdo even myself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah!
You’ve still got a way to go
Hee hee![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, you spoilsport![VAR 0114(0006)]
But it’s really thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou’re the reason why I’ve come so far!\c\nStill...I think I’ll take a little rest here.\c\nI’m afraid my legs are still shaking![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)], do you want a rest, too?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry. I’ve got you covered!\c\nI have Hyper Potions and Revives and even\nlots of Ethers, too.\c\nThough I’m not sure I brought enough Max\nRepels for a path like this one...[VAR 0114(0006)]

It looks like we’re nearly to the altar now,\naren’t we, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nLet me take care of [VAR PKNAME(0001)] for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When your Pokémon are full of energy, then a\nTrainer can go anywhere in the world...\r\nDoesn’t it seem that way?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m just...going to rest a moment.\c\nPhew. Looks like I still have enough Max Repels.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Once you’ve been through this place, you can\nreally get to understand why that Ilima boy\r\ndesigned his trial the way he did, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, yeah. Ohhhh, yeah.\nHere. Take this as a token of our acquaintance.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Alola’s light has been stolen by Necrozma...\c\nIt is only a matter of time before all of Alola is\nwrapped in such darkness.[VAR 0114(0036)]
And I really loved Alola’s light...\nIt was so warm...[VAR 0114(0037)]
Necrozma, the one that wields light to its will...\nIt would steal all of Alola’s light![VAR 0114(0039)]
Necrozma wants to take back the light that it\nonce lost.[VAR 0114(0038)]
But what are we to do now?\c\nIt seemed to me like that beast...like Necrozma\nwas also suffering somehow...\c\nIt seemed to hurt it, to be without its light...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You would worry even for Necrozma?\nYou are too kind, Lillie. Far too kind.\c\nThat is why you took Cosmog as well, isn’t it?\nYou foolish, sweet child...[VAR 0114(0014)]
We will need your help.\c\nWe need to be able to travel between worlds\nusing the Legendary Pokémon’s power, just\r\nas you are able to do.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You dare ask for our help now?![VAR 0114(0036)]
Now’s no time to be fighting, Dulse![VAR 0114(0037)]
Well...there is one thing I am curious about after\nwitnessing that battle just now...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Necrozma seemed quite distracted by that\nbracelet you wear...\r\nthat Z-Power Ring, or didn’t you think so?[VAR 0114(0036)]
You presume much.\c\nAnd despite that, it is true that you are trying\nto take care of things in your own way...\c\nShould I praise your sense of responsibility as\none charged with the protection of Pokémon?\r\nYou egotistical woman![VAR 0114(0039)]
Please, Captain Phyco...\nLeave it be.[VAR 0114(0038)]
It is as my subordinate says...\nSparring with you now will change nothing.\c\nAnd there is something I am more interested\nin pursuing.\r\nSomething I noticed during the battle just now...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Necrozma seemed distracted by you...\c\nBy that Z-Power Ring you wear, to be perfectly\naccurate.\c\nIt seemed to desire the light given off by that\nSparkling Stone set within it.[VAR 0114(0039)]
You mean...it wants Z-Crystals?![VAR 0114(0017)]
It’s true [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has an awfully large\nnumber of Z-Crystals after coming so far in h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nisland challenge...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, that’s true...\c\nEven more than the dumb captains and kahunas\nand all, who just focus on one type![VAR 0114(0017)]
I see...\nSo it is the Z-Crystals?\c\nAnd you...\c\nYou were truly able to summon Solgaleo.\nSuch an able Trainer...\c\nA Trainer like you might ride upon our Lunala to\nreach the world where Necrozma will be found.\c\nYes, just as you people ride upon your Pokémon\nhere in Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We call it the Ultra Warp Ride!\c\nIf you want to go after Necrozma, you’ll need to\nreach the [VAR COLOR(0001)]white warp hole[VAR COLOR(0000)] and go through it.\c\nAny other warp hole will send you to a different\nworld altogether.[VAR 0114(0037)]
It is not in our power to fight with Solgaleo.\c\nBut we do borrow its power to travel through\nthe Ultra Wormholes.\c\nYou have shown us what you are capable of,\nthough, by summoning Lunala to this place.\r\nPerhaps you could ride upon our Solgaleo.\r\nYes... Just as you ride upon Pokémon in Alola![VAR 0114(0038)]
We call it the Ultra Warp Ride.\c\nIf you hope to follow after Necrozma, you must\nmake for the [VAR COLOR(0001)]white warp hole[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nIf you enter any other warp hole, you will find\nyourself in another world altogether.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Can you not take your own little Solgaleo there?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Can you not take your own little Lunala there?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Lio...
Pea...
Losing its light...\nIt seems to have sapped its power as well...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Perhaps you will be able to save Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0036)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nPlease help Nebby for me! But also...if you can...\r\ntry to help Necrozma, as well...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And to think a Trainer who Lillie befriended\nwould become the one to battle Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’re a real pain, kid, but go and give that\nthing a good beatdown for me![VAR 0114(0017)]
We all share our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Do you want to ride on Lunala to try to reach\nthe [VAR COLOR(0001)]white warp hole[VAR COLOR(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0037)]
I’ll do that
Not now...
Lunala! Help us out![VAR 0114(0037)]
We all share our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Do you want to use Solgaleo’s power to try to\nreach the [VAR COLOR(0001)]white warp hole[VAR COLOR(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0038)]
I’ll do that

Welcome, resident of Alola.\c\nI am Soliera.\nI am a member of the Ultra Recon Squad.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Necrozma returned from Alola.\nYou will find it up ahead.\r\nIt seems to be resting atop the tower.\c\nOur people have all fled indoors to safety.\nThey fear it will fly into another rage, as it did\r\nwhen that woman Lusamine appeared.[VAR 0114(0038)]
So this is what the humans of Alola look like?\nI would quite like to investigate you further.\c\nHmm, yes. I am Phyco!\nI am the captain of the Ultra Recon Squad.\c\nNow that it has found a source of light,\nNecrozma will regain its true power.\c\nBut it cannot control its own light in the broken\nform it was left in after it lost a part of itself.\r\nThis power will only bring Necrozma more pain.[VAR 0114(0039)]
We used the power of our technology to try\nto quiet Necrozma...\c\nJust as we used our technology to try to\nprovide this dark world of ours with some light.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Necrozma...and us ourselves...\nwe have both suffered so many long years in\r\nthis darkness, living a life we did not wish for...[VAR 0114(0039)]
[~ 5]
Please. Help us stop Necrozma.\c\nYou will find it ahead of this place...\natop the Megalo Tower.[VAR 0114(0038)]
If you wish to return to the world of Alola,\nyou may ride upon our Lunala.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I’ll do that
No need
Then go...[VAR 0114(0039)]
Whoa! An Alolan person appeared riding on\nSolgaleo’s back!\r\nDulse, what should we do?!\r\nD’you think we should investigate h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer?![VAR 0114(0030)]
Remain calm, Zossie.\c\nHuman from the world of Alola.\nNecrozma has claimed Lunala’s power and is\r\nnow atop the Megalo Tower.\c\nThe people here have all fled indoors to safety.\nThey fear Necrozma will fly into another rage,\r\nas it did when that woman Lusamine appeared.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Necrozma will reclaim its true power, now\nthat it has stolen the light from another.\c\nBut it cannot control that light, and so Necrozma\nonly suffers more.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We used the power of our technology to try\nto quiet Necrozma, while also using it to provide\r\nsome small amount of light to ourselves.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Both Necrozma and our own people have lived\nlong years with a darkness that never should\r\nhave been, living a life we did not wish for...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Human of Alola!\c\nWill you not stop Necrozma and bring the light\nback to our world...and Alola?\c\nNecrozma lies ahead.\nYou will find it at the top of the Megalo Tower![VAR 0114(0036)]
[~ 17]
If you wanna go back to the world of Alola,\nyou can take our Solgaleo.[VAR 0114(0037)]
I’ll do that
No need
Help h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer out, Solgaleo![VAR 0114(0037)]

Necrozma is studying you.\nIt seems eager to do battle...
Lie... Lie... Liiight!
Necrozma lost its light...\nIt disappeared into another world...

It will likely take some time, but eventually we\nmay also be awash in light again. Like you all.\c\nMy thanks to the people of Alola.\nMy thanks to the light of the Z-Crystals.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Necrozma took on that brilliant form once again\nand became [VAR COLOR(0001)]Ultra Necrozma[VAR COLOR(0000)], thanks to you all.\c\nBut now...\c\nNecrozma has lost its light once more and\nappears to have fled to Alola.\c\nAnd your Solgaleo, weakened as it was, has also\nreturned to your world.\c\nI am most grateful for all you have done, human\nfrom the world of Alola.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Now what is Poipole creating a fuss for?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Captain Phyco...\c\nI believe that Poipole is showing an interest in\nthis person from Alola.\r\nIt seems to want to stay together with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer.[VAR 0114(0038)]
How fascinating.\c\nDoes it perhaps seek to become stronger?\nOr is there some other reason for its interest?[VAR 0114(0039)]
According to what we have learned through our\ninvestigations, I believe that in your world, giving\r\na Pokémon to another can be a way of\r\ndemonstrating your feelings for them...\c\nAnd besides, Poipole seems to want to go.\nTake it with you, if you have no objection.[VAR 0114(0038)]
I’d be happy to
Maybe next time
I see...\nPlease take Poipole with you at another time.[VAR 0114(0038)]
If you would like to return to your world of Alola,\nplease ride upon our Lunala.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I’ll take you up on that offer
Hold on, I’m not ready yet...
Good![VAR 0114(0039)]
I do not know how long it will take, but someday\nin the distant future, perhaps we will also be\r\nable to bathe in such light again in our world...\c\nI am thankful to you, human of Alola.\nTo you and the light of your Z-Crystals.[VAR 0114(0036)]
The Necrozma that you managed to quiet...\nYes, you might call it [VAR COLOR(0001)]Ultra Necrozma[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nIt shone with such blinding light, as it used to,\nonly to lose that light all over again...\c\nIt seems to have fled to Alola now.\c\nAnd your Lunala also returned home as soon as\nit was freed.\c\nI am grateful that you heard our request and\nfulfilled our dearest wishes.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Oh? What’s Poipole acting up for now?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Hey, Dulse... Do you think maybe Poipole is\ncurious about this Alolan person, too?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Then let me gift this Poipole to you.\nIt is a sign of my gratitude to you. And also...\r\nto grant the wish Poipole itself seems to hold.\c\nWill you take Poipole with you?[VAR 0114(0036)]
I’d be happy to
Maybe next time
You can always return to get Poipole another\ntime. Come back for it.[VAR 0114(0036)]
If you wanna go back to your world of Alola,\nSolgaleo can get you there.[VAR 0114(0037)]
I’ll take you up on that offer
Hold on, I’m not ready yet...
Help h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer out, Solgaleo![VAR 0114(0037)]
Poi!
If you wish to return to the world of Alola,\nyou may ride upon our Lunala. Though...\r\nI suppose you could also ride upon our Solgaleo.\c\nWhich would you like to take?\nLunala or Solgaleo?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Lunala
Solgaleo
Come speak with me if you wish to change\nwhich Pokémon you will ride.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I’ll let you ride on our Solgaleo if you wanna go\nback to the world of Alola!\r\nOr would you rather ride on our Lunala instead?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Solgaleo
Lunala
Got it! And come talk to me if you change your\nmind about which Pokémon you want to ride![VAR 0114(0037)]

Impressive, human of Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Thank you so much![VAR 0114(0037)]
While you were battling Necrozma in our Ultra\nMegalopolis, we were able to make some\r\ndiscoveries about the auras here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
The auras of Alola came from Necrozma! They’re\nthe remnants of the light it emitted long ago![VAR 0114(0037)]
These...auras...must have been particularly\nstrong at the trial locations. And the Z-Power\r\nfor the Z-Moves... It is also similar to the auras\r\nof the Totem Pokémon. Both came to Alola as\r\nNecrozma’s light![VAR 0114(0036)]
You are such a powerful Trainer... Maybe you\ncan return the light to Necrozma, without having\r\nit run wild.[VAR 0114(0036)]
As a sign of thanks, we’ll continue to share our\nLunala with you.\c\nUse the Ultra Warp Ride to explore many new\nand different worlds! No doubt you will find\r\namazing Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
I think we will stay in Alola for a while. It is\npractically overflowing with Z-Power.\c\nIt would be good for us to really experience life\nhere. Maybe even do our own island challenge.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Ooh, ooh! I want to become friends with Diglett![VAR 0114(0037)]
Most impressive, youth who holds the\nZ-Power Ring!\c\nI can feel the auras focusing on the Z-Power\nRing, even as we speak.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Thank you very much, trial-goer.[VAR 0114(0038)]
While you faced Necrozma in our Ultra\nMegalopolis, there are some things we found out\r\nabout the auras that fill Alola...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Before our ancestors were forced to contain it,\nNecrozma emitted powerful light... That light is\r\nwhat you call auras![VAR 0114(0038)]
That light must have passed through the Ultra\nWormholes and rained down throughout Alola...\c\nIndeed, this must be how the trial sites got\ntheir unique properties.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Yes... Both the Z-Power for the Z-Moves and\nthe auras of the Totem Pokémon are powers\r\ngifted to you by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0038)]
A Trainer as gifted as yourself may be able to\nreturn the light to Necrozma, without sending\r\nit into another rage.[VAR 0114(0039)]
As thanks for your help, we will continue to\nshare our Solgaleo with you freely.\c\nYou should be able to meet many amazing \nPokémon by using Ultra Warp Ride to explore\r\ndifferent worlds![VAR 0114(0038)]
It would not be a bad idea to continue research\non Alola, with all of its Z-Power!\c\nThere’s much for us to learn here, no doubt.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I...would like to travel Alola as a Trainer, along\nwith my Pokémon partners.[VAR 0114(0038)]

No, I just...\c\nThe one who really did everything was\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], not me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Here... You should take these Beast Balls.\nPut out your hand.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Those are special Poké Balls that we developed\nwith the Ultra Recon Squad’s help to capture\r\nUltra Beasts.\c\nI know I can trust leaving them in the hands of\na Trainer like you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
With its light stolen from it, Cosmog is...\nNo, Solgaleo is weak.\c\nWe will take it back to Paradise to care for it.\nLillie, you will help also.[VAR 0114(0014)]
With its light stolen from it, Cosmog is...\nNo, Lunala is weak.\c\nWe will take it back to Paradise to care for it.\nLillie, you will help also.[VAR 0114(0014)]

About a lot of things, really.\nAnd I think I understand a little better now.[VAR 0114(0006)]

But I’m not going to let you take all the good\nparts! I’m a captain, too, you know?\c\nSo why don’t you see if you can beat my trial?[VAR 0114(0012)]
If you’re ready to try, just come by my house.\nIt’s in Seafolk Village.\c\nOr, yeah, I guess you could just come with me...\nLet me know if you wanna go together.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hey! So what do you think?\nYou wanna go back home with me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I do!

So you will truly go?[VAR 0114(0038)]
Our Ultra Megalopolis was once a world filled\nwith light...\c\nNecrozma was called the Blinding One, and it\ngave us all the energy we needed.[VAR 0114(0039)]
And in fact, we were not the only ones who\nbasked in its light.\c\nIt traveled even to the distant world of Alola\nby passing through the Ultra Wormholes![VAR 0114(0039)]
But...our ancestors grew too greedy, and they\ncaused Necrozma to lose a part of its body.\r\nAnd this in turn made Necrozma run wild...\c\nHelp it if you can. We beg you...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Be careful, people of Alola...\nNecrozma is really strong.[VAR 0114(0037)]
There’s nothing that we here can do...\c\nWe can no longer control it with our technology,\nand we certainly have no hope of defeating it\r\nin battle ourselves...[VAR 0114(0036)]
The light of Necrozma once filled our world.\c\nAnd it did not shine upon us alone. It gave\nenergy to many, throughout Ultra Space.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Yeah, Necrozma is amazing!\nThat’s why...if you could just help it calm down...\r\nI bet it would share its light with everybody\r\nagain, like it used to.\c\nPlease...\nYou’ve got to help it![VAR 0114(0037)]

Lunala...\c\nNo...\c\nNebby.\c\nNebby, you belong with [VAR TRNAME(0000)] now.\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe will be the one to raise you.\c\nJust like any parent should raise their child.\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe will be your [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]famother now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I may not have been able to do anything for you,\nNebby...but I’m still glad I took you that day.\c\nSo go with [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and see the world!\c\nHave battles against strong Pokémon where you\ncan use your full power.\c\nMeet other Trainers who will make your heart\ndance with the thrill of it all...\c\nThat’s the kind of world that [VAR TRNAME(0000)]\ncan share with you![VAR 0114(0006)]
If it’s you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI know I can trust you to raise my Nebby well.\r\nTake good care of it![VAR 0114(0006)]
And I...will go to my mother.\c\nI need to see for myself that she’ll be all right.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nebby!\c\nDon’t always be trying to get out of your\nPoké Ball the way you always wriggled out\r\nof my Bag![VAR 0114(0006)]
And...and don’t forget that you’re strong now.\nYou’ll have to be careful not to accidentally\r\nhurt anyone until you get used to your strength![VAR 0114(0006)]
And...and you can’t just go running off to some\nother world anytime without telling anyone!\r\nYou’ll make [VAR TRNAME(0000)] worry![VAR 0114(0006)]
OK...\nI’m really...\r\nI’m really going this time.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Cripes, but I hate this place...\nIt’s exhausting climbing all the way up here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
At least you gave me a good show, though.\c\nGuess it was worth coming this far.\nAnd the prof did ask me and all...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Look, once you’ve completed all your island\ntrials and done your grand trials, then you’ve\r\ngot to do one last thing...\c\nThe final trial.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Basically it’s a ceremony, you see?\nYou beat all four kahunas in a row.\r\nBut things are a little different this year.\c\nNow that we’re getting a real Pokémon League\nhere in Alola, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, boy.\c\nI hope you can bother yourself to come along to\nthe base of Ula’ula Island’s Mount Lanakila.\c\nYou remember Tapu Village, don’t you?\nWhere they’ve got a Pokémon Center?\c\nHe’ll be ready and waiting for you there.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I suppose I could take you along with me...\nYou want to do that? Come now, with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we’re on this journey together, then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not many kids make it all the way to the final\ntrial, but there’s a handful every year.\c\nYou won’t be able to go easy on this one.\nThese are real battles. No holding back.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Oh! Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI heard the news from Gladion, you know.\nSavior of Alola, huh? Heh heh!\c\nI’m glad I got to set out on my island challenge\ntogether with such an awesome Trainer.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But I’m not slacking off, either!\c\nIt’s good to have fun in battle, sure...\c\nBut losing a battle because all you’re really\ndoing is having fun is...well...\c\nYou can’t let down your Pokémon when they’re\nfighting their hardest for you, now can you?[VAR 0114(0007)]

When we’re both done with our island\nchallenges, we should have a serious battle.\r\nYou and me.\c\nPokémon and their Trainers have gotta have\ntheir hearts in the same place if they’re gonna\r\nwin in battle!\r\nThat’s the way to really have a blast together![VAR 0114(0007)]

Oh, it’s you...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Look, kid...\c\nAbout what happened with Necrozma...\nI guess I should...\c\nThanks. I’m saying thanks. OK?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hey!\nIf it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Guzma!\r\nWhat’re the two of you doing together?[VAR 0114(0007)]
The kahuna’s grandson, huh...\nWe’re not doin’ nothin’.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh yeah!\nI’ve got something I wanted to ask you, Guzma!\c\nThat Golisopod you’ve got, yeah...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Huh? This dude?\nYeah, he’s been with me since before I started\r\nout on my island challenge. My partner.[VAR 0114(0017)]
There ain’t nobody in Team Skull who can beat\nmy Golisopod.\c\nThe rest of my team, too. I met them all during\nmy island challenge and trained ’em up as\r\ngood as anything.\c\n...Not that any of that matters now.[VAR 0114(0017)]
So you got to meet your Pokémon partners by\ndoing the island challenge and made some\r\nreally great friends, too, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Friends?
He did?
You know! Everybody in Team Skull!\c\nThey all really love Guzma after all, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
You’ll meet Pokémon and people on your journey\nthat’ll enrich your life. Is that it?\c\n...Geez.\nYou really are old Hala’s grandson...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Who knows? Maybe kids like you can make the\nisland challenge actually mean something again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Here. I don’t need this anymore.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ho...\nHere it comes again. The winds of Alola are\r\nblowing again, bringing some new change.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Just you wait, Guzma!\c\nI’m gonna outdo even the kahunas!\c\nAnd I’m gonna make sure everybody knows they\ncan be something great, whether they choose\r\nto do the island challenge or not![VAR 0114(0007)]
You didn’t fail to become a captain, Guzma!\nNo matter what you might think!\c\nSo go become something else—something that\nnobody else has ever managed to be![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nConsider this one last warning!\c\nI told you before, but once we both finish up our\nisland challenges, we’re gonna have a serious\r\nbattle—you and me![VAR 0114(0007)]

So the time has come for you to wrap up your\nisland challenge.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I even had an all-out battle against Hau,\nholding nothing at all back...\r\nand I was defeated in spectacular fashion![VAR 0114(0008)]

Heh.\nI will be awaiting you, then.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then allow me to show you the power of the\nkahuna chosen by Tapu Fini itself![VAR 0114(000B)]
I am Kahuna Hapu!\c\nAnd with the Sparkling Stone entrusted to me\nby the tapu, I have made this Z-Power Ring![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nHaving Z-Power Rings as we do means that\nwe battle with the tapu beside us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu!\c\nI will battle you with everything that I have got![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
Phew...\c\nYou are undoubtedly a prodigious\nTrainer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
You have succeeded in your final grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]
In the past, any Trainer who completed the\nisland challenge would make a pilgrimage to\r\nMount Lanakila to battle the kahunas once more.\c\nIn these battles alone, the kahunas would no\nlonger hold back in any way.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But this year, you will face a different sort of\nfinal trial upon Mount Lanakila.\c\nThat will be your next destination, but first let\nus return to Poni Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]

And the only thing I can offer you in thanks\nis a great battle.\c\nSo I’m going to show my full power...\nMy real full power this time!\r\nWith the Z-Power Ring that old man gave me![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ve got [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0002)]a good Pokémon.\c\nI know what kind of Trainer you are now.\nAnd what kind of journey you’ve been through.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know why you of all people could save Lillie.\nWhy you could save Cosmog...and Alola.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Last time I saw Lillie, she was heading up to\nMahalo Trail...\r\nIt seemed like she had something on her mind.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She’s...she’s gentle enough to be able to feel\nhow much pain Pokémon go through.\r\nI guess that’s a kind of strength, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here. Take this.\nShe wanted me to give it to you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You know, I tried battling Hau, too...\nHe’s really changed.\c\nI’m not surprised anymore that he managed to\nbeat even Kahuna Hala.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmph...\c\nIf you two are going to get even stronger, then\nI guess I can’t let down my guard yet.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know we aren’t friends.\c\nBut we aren’t enemies anymore either.\c\nKeep winning. Maybe I’ll see you again if you do.[VAR 0114(0013)]

I was just thinking it was time to take on the\nPokémon League...\c\nThen I heard from Gladion that you were already\nheading here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nSo I booked it here as fast as I could![VAR 0114(0007)]
That was, like, the fastest I’ve ever moved in\nmy life, you know![VAR 0114(0007)]
But that’s not what I came here to tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWe’re gonna decide which one of us’ll be the\r\nfirst to the Pokémon League!\c\nYou’re gonna need to use your full force if you\nthink you’re gonna beat me and my team when\r\nwe’re serious about winning![VAR 0114(0007)]
Ooooh, and I really wanted my Pokémon to know\nhow it feels to beat your team this time!\c\nBut being seriously frustrated will only make\nme stronger![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you’d better go and become Champion.\c\n’Cause I’m gonna train so that next time I can\ncome beat Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\r\nGood luck, cuz, and here![VAR 0114(0007)]

Necrozma has fallen to the ground, weak and\ndrained of power...
Will you share the light of your Z-Power Ring\nwith Necrozma?
Yes
No

Necrozma disappeared off somewhere...
You found a Z-Crystal that fell from Necrozma...
You obtained the Ultranecrozium Z!
Splendid![VAR 0114(002B)]
It’s been a while, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou must be a formidable Trainer indeed if you\nare able to get Necrozma as one of your allies.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Good!\nAnd this is from me!\c\nThe Ultra Recon Squad asked me to develop a\ndevice that would be able to control Necrozma.\r\nBut I improved it to my own liking!\c\nAnd now it is a device that makes it possible to\ndraw out even more power from Necrozma![VAR 0114(002B)]

Yes, in short, it makes it possible for Necrozma\nto fuse with the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo!\c\nThis is the Colress Machine No. 1198, officially\ndubbed the N-Solarizer![VAR 0114(002B)]
In addition, this is the Colress Machine\nNo. 1199, officially dubbed the N-Lunarizer!\c\nIt makes it possible for Necrozma to fuse with\nthe Legendary Pokémon, Lunala![VAR 0114(002B)]
Ah yes. I have heard in fact that you first met\nSolgaleo—no, its pre-evolved Cosmog—upon\r\nMahalo Trail.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Ah yes. I have heard in fact that you first met\nLunala—no, its pre-evolved Cosmog—upon\r\nMahalo Trail.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I believe that a Trainer like you will be able to\nuse both Alola’s Legendary Pokémon and the\r\nfearsome power of Necrozma properly![VAR 0114(002B)]
I happen to know quite a bit about Pokémon\nfusion myself...\r\nBut that is a different tale.\c\nGood luck in your battles![VAR 0114(002B)]

I still remember it like it was yesterday!\c\nI went all the way to Indigo Plateau, yeah, right\nto the Pokémon League headquarters...\r\nand I went right at them, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey!
Kukui asked me to, so I decided to be in the\nElite Four.\c\nI’m looking forward to battling against you\nand Sophocles in the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Kukui made Trainers who he thought were\nstrong into members of the Elite Four, but he\r\ndidn’t choose any challengers. He’s waiting for a\r\nfresh breeze to blow through Alola.[VAR 0114(001C)]
The Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’re gonna be a Trainer who\neveryone admires.[VAR 0114(001C)]

Nanu said maybe he can’t refuse a tapu\nchoosing him to serve as kahuna...\c\nBut he’d be darned if he had to serve as one of\nthe Elite Four just because some guy asked him!\c\nSo I guess I’ll just have to battle hard enough\nto make up for his not being here![VAR 0114(0011)]
Phew!\c\nWell, there goes my hope of beating you to\nsmithereens and becoming Champion myself![VAR 0114(0011)]

Being in the Elite Four is fun, but so is being a\ncaptain...\r\nHmm, I’m not sure which to do...[VAR 0114(0011)]

You’ve blasted right through the Elite Four!\nWell, first off, let me say congratulations!\c\nBut don’t lose your momentum now!\nJust keep storming ahead![VAR 0114(0011)]

So, here you are...\c\nWhy don’t we see who the winds favor today,\nyou...or me?
Alola! And alola once again!\nMy name is Kahili.\c\nA few years ago, I was a champion of the island\nchallenge, too. Just like you.\c\nI’ve been traveling the world to improve my skill\nas both a Trainer and as a golfer.\c\nWhen I heard that they’d made a Pokémon\nLeague in my own home region, I came flying\r\nback to serve Alola.\c\nHave a look at my fantastic Flying-type team![VAR 0114(0019)]
You know...I think you’ll bring a breath of fresh\nair to the Alola battle scene.\c\nI was honestly annoyed when Kukui kept\npestering me to come here, but I’m glad I did.[VAR 0114(0019)]
So, you came to battle me again!\c\nIf I beat you, the number one ranked Trainer in\nAlola, then I’ll be ready to take on the world!\c\nI’m coming for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0019)]
That battle was worthy of being number one\nin Alola...\c\nMaybe even number one in the world!\nBut next time, I’ll win. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0019)]
There are three more members of the Elite Four.\c\nAnd every one of them is a top-class Trainer.[VAR 0114(0019)]
There are two more members of the Elite Four...\c\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised if you have a hard\ntime deciding which one to take on next.[VAR 0114(0019)]
There is just one member of the Elite Four left.\c\nI hope you enjoy the transcendent kind of battle\nyou only find at the top of the Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0019)]
Do you wonder what lies beyond the Elite Four?\c\nGo. See with your own eyes what awaits you.[VAR 0114(0019)]

Oh yeah, now you’re the\nPokémon League Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wouldn’t it be nice if it was that simple?\c\nThe truth is, there’s one more person you have\nto battle if you want that title.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course that Trainer is me. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just kidding![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s me![VAR 0114(0007)]
You know what?\c\nSomething kinda hit me after I finally beat my\nold gramps in an all-out serious battle.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re kinda my hero, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou and your team are, I mean![VAR 0114(0007)]
And because I really look up to you...\c\nI really wanna have a serious battle against you!\nI really want to be able to win against you!\c\n’Cause it’s way more fun when Pokémon and\ntheir Trainers are all friends and get along.\r\nThen they can do something really amazing![VAR 0114(0007)]
One final hurrah for your island challenge.\c\nAnd a special tribute as you and this\nPokémon League embark on a new path!\r\nLet’s have a battle worthy of this moment![VAR 0114(0005)]
We managed to pull off something pretty\namazing, when my partners and I were all in\r\nsync and wanting the same thing.\c\nBut looks like we’re still one step away from\nbeing the strongest Trainer and team!\c\nBut you know what’s funny?\c\nEven though we lost, that was more exciting\nthan any other battle I’ve ever had till now!\c\nEverything’s all mixed up inside me—it was so\nfun and so frustrating, and just...\r\nYup! It was just awesome, really![VAR 0114(0007)]
Amazing! You and Hau are both\namazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIt’s like I told you before, the strongest moves\nyou can use are the ones a Trainer and their\r\nPokémon choose together in the heat of the\r\nmoment—when it really counts.\c\nAnd you just proved me right! Congrats, cousin.\nYou’re a Champion we can all be proud of.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I told you, didn’t I? Up there on Mount Hokulani.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Man, the Pokémon and the Trainers in Alola\nreally are the best!\c\nI want everyone in the world to know that, too!\nThat’s always been my dream![VAR 0114(0005)]
And right here, right now, it finally came true!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou and your [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

I’m so happy I got to see that flamin’ hot battle\nhere, right where my dreams came true!\c\nAnd now...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nFirst-ever Champion of the Alola\r\nPokémon League!\c\nIt’s time we record you and your beloved\npartner’s achievement for eternity![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nFirst-ever Champion of the Alola\r\nPokémon League!\c\nIt’s time we record you and your beloved\nteam’s achievement for eternity![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 3]
You really do love your Pokémon with all your\nheart, don’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yup! That’s precisely why [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon\nwere able to combine that strength to\r\nemerge victorious![VAR 0114(0009)]
Now we’re all going to be aiming for your seat.\nI hope you’re ready for some rivals.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 7]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLet’s go celebrate you becoming Alola’s first\never Champion together with everybody!\c\nMy old gramps said we’d have an awesome\nparty, no matter which one of us won![VAR 0114(0007)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], let’s bust a U-turn\nfor Melemele Island!\c\nWe’re gonna have a big festival in Iki Town!\nDon’t worry, I’ll be sure to let Lillie know, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 404

Here [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she is! The first Pokémon League \nChampion from Alola!\c\nThis calls for celebration, so let’s all get to it![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nCongratulations on becoming the Champion![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nAll these people are here just to help you\ncelebrate this achievement, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Everyone looks so happy...\nThe adults, the children...even the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
It...it hasn’t all been easy...\nbut I’m really glad that I came to Alola![VAR 0114(0006)]
Getting to meet you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nNo...\c\nit wasn’t just meeting you.\nIt was traveling together with you.\c\nI’m so glad I got to be a part of that journey![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nIt looks like the party is going to keep on going\nstrong for some time still, wouldn’t you say?\c\nDo you think...maybe...we could sneak out for\na second and visit the Ruins of Conflict?\c\nI heard from Kahuna Hala that the bridge\nhas been fixed.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure!
What about the festival?
I think Tapu Koko must be waiting...\c\nI’m sure it’s waiting for you to come to it,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nnow that you finished your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Really, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWe should go and tell Tapu Koko properly...\nhow you finished your island challenge![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 405

Now this really takes me back...\c\nBack then I could barely think about anything.\nI was so desperate...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Solgaleo...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Lunala...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on! Let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Ruins of Conflict...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I still wonder why it is that Tapu Koko helped\nus that day...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Was it because of some connection to Solgaleo...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Was it because of some connection to Lunala...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]

This reminds me of when Hapu became the\nkahuna of Poni Island...[VAR 0114(0006)]
My heart is pounding in my chest...\nIs it because of the sacred guardian?\r\nIs Tapu Koko here with us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 408
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Great Tapu Koko...\c\nit was because of your help that Cosmog lived\nand was able to become Solgaleo.\c\nPlease allow me to thank you on its behalf.\nThank you so very, very much![VAR 0114(0006)]
Great Tapu Koko...\c\nIt was because of your help that Cosmog lived\nand was able to become Lunala.\c\nPlease allow me to thank you on its behalf.\nThank you so very, very much![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s your turn next, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
I want to see you show your appreciation in the\nway that only Alola’s Champion could!\c\nI know you can do this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’ll make sure your team is ready, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Honestly!\c\nIt’s time you showed Tapu Koko your gratitude.\nDo it through one of the battles that it so loves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You reached out and touched the statue...
You seem to hear a voice ringing in your head...\nas though it’s coming from your Z-Power Ring...?
GOOD...SOLGALEO...
GOOD...LUNALA...
IT IS TIME...
Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
Tapu Koko disappeared...
A Z-Crystal clattered to the floor at your feet...
There is no reaction from the statue...
Tapu Koko... It may have lost that battle to you,\nbut I don’t think it was sad about that.\c\nI’m sure that the two of you will meet in battle\nagain someday![VAR 0114(0006)]
Tapu Koko...\c\nI know it will aspire to ever greater heights at\nyour side from now on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
So you’ll challenge Tapu Koko another day...\c\nI suppose Trainers must know how to judge the\nstrength of their opponents and must also\r\nunderstand their own limits.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The great Tapu Koko...\nIt really is fantastically strong, isn’t it!\r\nNo wonder it is the guardian of all Akala![VAR 0114(0006)]
But I’m so glad we could come here.\nIt had been weighing on my heart...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWe should get back to the village.\c\nIf we don’t return soon, everyone will realize\nthat we slipped away from the festival![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 409
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everyone looks like they are having so much fun\nthat I don’t think they even noticed we left...\c\nOh!\nAnd the Battle Royals are about to begin![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s a beautiful festival, isn’t it...\nEveryone looks so happy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I hope that you’ll always stay just the way\nyou are now, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nLook how your joy has brought so much light\nto everyone here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think even my mother would have smiled and\nlaughed to see this...if she would have come...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But she...didn’t think she was in any position to\nmeet you all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
She was being very stubborn about it, so I had\nto give her a bit of a scolding about it.\r\nGently, of course.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think...if I could just help her, and everyone,\nfind something to smile about again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI...I am going to—[VAR 0114(0006)]
Whoa-ho!
Look at this! Everybody’s so fired up. Woo!\c\nWe’ve got the birth of Alola’s strongest ever\nTrainer to celebrate, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
I may have lost, but I’m gonna keep working\nhard to be totally in sync with my partners\r\nand pull out my Pokémon’s full power![VAR 0114(0007)]
And THEN...\c\nI’m coming for you!\nChampion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry! I mean, Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sure everybody here wants to see your\npartner[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0100)]s, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on and show us th[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0C0A)]at partnerose partners that w[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0302)]asere\nthere for so many of your discoveries, new\r\nexperiences, and adventures on your\r\nisland challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh! Auntie!\nHi! Sorry![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh! Auntie!\nEvening! Sorry![VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll explain later, but...but...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] has to come with me right now![VAR 0114(0007)]

Oooh! And there’s that Kantonian Meowth!\nLook at that shiny coin on your head, kitty-kitty![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mrowr?
I finally got my gramps to go all out and be\nserious in a battle against me!\c\nI got some sweet rewards, so take this one,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Good luck is best shared![VAR 0114(0007)]
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Decidueye.\nThe Decidium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Incineroar.\nThe Incinium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Primarina.\nThe Primarium Z is yours!
Now you can power up, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s so nice of you, Hau. Thank you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Naw! No problem, auntie!\c\nSay. Is Kanto, like, really far way?[VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s pretty close
It’s pretty far
Yes, I’d say it’s pretty close.\nClose enough to visit whenever you want to![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well...\nit’s true that it’s not the next island or anything.\c\nBut it’s still close enough to visit whenever you\nwant to![VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! Then it’s decided!\c\nI’m gonna get stronger and stronger, and then\nI’m gonna travel the world with my Pokémon!\c\nI’m gonna go find Lillie!\nAnd my dad, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Your father?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, yeah, him. Heh...\c\nHe’s a strong Trainer—real strong, I think.\nBut I guess he really hated being the son of\r\na kahuna and everything, yeah?\r\nSo he works far away from Alola these days.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think I’m gonna go train myself up at the\nBattle Tree, then beat you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nand I’ll be a Champion next time I see him!\r\nSeems like a nice little present, eh? Hehe![VAR 0114(0007)]
What is a Battle Tree, Hau?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, it’s this thing way deep on Poni Island!\c\nAnybody who has passed the island challenge—\nor who is strong enough to, anyway—can battle\r\nit out with their Pokémon! Or so they say.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLet’s have the best ever battle at that Pokémon\nLeague sometime. No backing out![VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s right...\c\nNow that you’re the current Champion,\neveryone is going to want to challenge you![VAR 0114(0004)]

You know, Lillie...\nKanto is a long way away from here.\r\nTry not to let the jet lag hit you too hard.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Burnet’s...well...\c\nshe said she’d be too sad to watch you go,\nso she wouldn’t even come out with me.\c\nI know it’s a lot to ask, but forgive her this\ntime, wouldja?\c\nShe did tell me to let you know the loft in the\nlab is yours to use indefinitely.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So you can come back and stay whenever you\nlike, Lillie![VAR 0114(0005)]
You didn’t tell us![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hau...\nI’m sorry...\c\nBut I’ve decided. I have to go to Kanto.\c\nTo help my mother get better...\nbut more than that...to help myself get stronger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course I’m sad to leave Alola...[VAR 0114(0006)]
but...the thought of going to Kanto also fills\nmy heart with excitement![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m going to become a real Trainer and meet all\nkinds of wonderful Pokémon...\c\nI’m going to travel all around Kanto, just like we\ndid here on Alola for your island challenges![VAR 0114(0006)]
And no matter what happens on my journey...\nI’m going to be OK.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Because of the smiles that you shared with me.\nYou and [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and everyone here...\r\nthank you all so much![VAR 0114(0006)]
And that’s why someday...\nsomeday I’ll come back to Alola again![VAR 0114(0006)]

I will, Hau.\nAnd please...take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’m back!\nAnd I’ll keep on coming back, too!\r\nNo matter how many times it takes.\c\nI’m not giving up until I overcome the obstacle\nthat’s staring me right in the face![VAR 0114(0007)]
Man, I really want to be stronger than a kahuna!\c\nBut I still just don’t get how I can do that...\c\nBut if I keep trying and using my full power,\nI think I’ll find the way. That’s how I feel\r\nwhenever I battle against you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nThat’s why I love battling you![VAR 0114(0007)]
This is one battle I don’t want to lose...\nNot against you!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] and my team are the best,\nand they really want to win, too.\c\nI can’t let them down. I’ve gotta at least do that\nmuch for them if I’m a real Trainer![VAR 0114(0007)]
Man, it’s like you’re so close to me but I still\ncan’t reach you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nI just can’t close the gap between us...\c\nBut I’ll be fine.\nI’ve got [VAR PKNAME(0001)] and everybody!\c\nYou’d better stay the Champ and wait here\nfor me to come challenge you again someday![VAR 0114(0007)]
Phew! It is difficult, triumphing over all the\nElite Four in a row.\c\nHowever, defeating the Champion will\nsurely be even more challenging.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We do our utmost as kahunas, always striving\nonward to make a tale worthy of our history.\c\nLooks like you are going to make a fine tale for\nyourself, Champion![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I am serious about my role as a kahuna, then\ntaking on the Champion seems fitting![VAR 0114(000B)]
We kahunas are chosen by Pokémon.\nAnd the Champion is chosen by the people.\c\nIt brings me some joy to see this new age\ncoming to Alola.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does a Pokémon Trainer really need to be\nsuccessful?\c\nI trained for a long time trying to figure that out.\c\nI guess everyone might have their own answer.\nBut at least for me...\r\nI want the strongest rival for myself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I didn’t beat you, but it was still worth it...\nGoing to train in Kanto, I mean.\c\nAt the very least, I can appreciate your strength\na lot more now than I could’ve before.\c\nThanks, Champ.\nYou’ve helped make us stronger.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You just use your best moves and see who is\nleft standing at the end, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Phew... I’ll be back again.\nYou can count on that, Champion![VAR 0114(0013)]
Champion... Now that is a title that everyone\nin Alola would bow before!\c\nI’m already a champion when it comes to power\nand prestige, after all...\r\nTaking this title would be my just deserts![VAR 0114(0015)]
I admit you have potential...\c\nYou have proved to me that my judgment of\nyou when we first met was flawless, as usual.\c\nYou are a worthy Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
As long as you claim that title, I will keep\nclawing my way here to you!\c\nThat’s right! I’m here to relieve you of the\ntitle of Pokémon League Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
You wait...\nSomeday I will claw my way back up here again...\c\nbut I suppose I should congratulate you first!\c\nSee how bighearted I am to praise my opponent![VAR 0114(0015)]
The name’s Ryuki. I’m what you might call a star.\c\nI mean, with partners like my Pokémon, how\ncould I not be a star?\c\nI came all the way across the sea here to Alola\nto spread my fame out here, too! The whole\r\nworld will be mine soon![VAR 0114(001A)]
Everyone’s got their own problems, huh?\c\nThe critics loved my songs, but nobody was\nbuying my music for a while, man.\c\nBut I’m just a rocker down to my bones.\nNothing else to do but keep on rocking.\c\nI dig you, Champ. Looks like you know who\nyou are, too, right down to your bones.[VAR 0114(001A)]
My babies here are dying to play a set.\nI figure what better stage than the Champion’s!\c\nAllow me to introduce my bandmates!\nCome on, babies![VAR 0114(001A)]
Oooh, that Champion’s strength!\nI feel the flames of jealousy burning in my heart!\c\nBut passing through the fire makes me stronger,\nand that’s why I’m a star!\c\nI’ll roll into town again sometime, Champ.\nI’m always looking for a good gig.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I came to keep my word about us having a\nbattle next time, as I said after my trial\r\nat the Observatory.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’re great, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou understand Pokémon so well and know so\nmuch about Pokémon battles.\c\nI see that thinking up this and that to try to\ndefeat the Champion is the highest form of fun![VAR 0114(0010)]
Playing games with Big Mo...\c\nMaintaining Festival Plaza...\c\nChecking the anime I’ve recorded...\c\nThey’re all fun but not the same as a battle with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI worked out a plan with Ilima against you, \n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], to try to win.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’re way too strong, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\n“Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0” is \nrunning smoothly, so next I’m thinking that\c\nI should put together Sophocles’s\nenhanced program.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I came to check on what Kukui has built, and...\nthe Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Just as I’d expect from an acquaintance\nof Kukui’s!\c\nI too am proud that you are the strongest\nPokémon Trainer in Alola!\c\nI’ll try to come hang out again.\c\nPokémon battles with you are more fun than\nany game![VAR 0114(001C)]
I gave the captain position to my cousin\nSophocles, but I’m confident in my ability.\c\nMy strength is like that of a supernova![VAR 0114(001C)]
Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...\nAt some point I want to have a battle with\r\nSophocles and me as a duo versus you and\r\nKukui for all the marbles. Or I guess a\r\nBattle Royal?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I don’t really wanna be the Champion of the\nPokémon League I made myself, but there’s\r\nnothing wrong with wanting to take on the\r\nbiggest and baddest Trainer there is, right?\c\nAfter all, I do love my research![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’m coming at you \nwith all my might. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Those old dudes Molayne and Nanu somehow\ntalked me into doing this.\c\nI’m starting from scratch as a Pokémon Trainer\nand doing it right this time.\c\nI’ve got a Z-Power Ring now, so I might\nactually be able to live up to their expectations.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Even when I give it my all, I’m nothing compared\nto you!\c\nMaybe my Pokémon and I need to go through\nmore together to deepen our friendship.\c\nI’m out of here, Champ.[VAR 0114(0018)]
My team and I are battling for all the Pokémon\nwe took out on our way here![VAR 0114(0018)]
I failed again...like I always do. I promised\nmyself I wouldn’t! I told myself I would never\r\nfail again!\c\nIt’s all right to feel a little jealous, right?\nHow else am I supposed to get stronger?\c\nMy team and I really did take out so many\nPokémon to make it here![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Champion!\nYou’ve gotta recommend a move for me!
I trained as much as I could on Route 1...\c\nI went through the whole island challenge to\nget here...\c\nand still!\nMan, the Champion really is something!
Champion! I’m gonna serve you up a brutal\nhelping of my Pokémon’s best moves!
Well, at least I know you’ll never beat me in how\nmuch we each love our Pokémon, Champion!
The Pokémon League...\c\nThey say that being the strongest Pokémon\nTrainer is not enough to become Champion.\c\nSo how about you show me exactly what kind\nof Trainer you are?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Caring won’t keep the things you love safe.\c\nBut if you don’t care, if you’re so hard at heart,\nyou may find you have nothing left to protect...\c\nIs that it?\c\nMaybe I can understand Lillie a little better now.[VAR 0114(0014)]
As the president of the Aether Foundation,\nand as Lillie’s mother...\c\nI will take you on in battle, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0014)]
Strong and yet kind...\c\nNo... Perhaps your strength in fact comes from\nthat kindness.\c\nThank you for battling with me.\nThank you for being Lillie’s friend.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
Who knows what the Alolan winds will bring?\c\nNext time we meet, I’m counting on you to test\nhow strong I’ve gotten.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I felt the winds of Alola blowin’ and got an itch\nto come see you...\c\nYou know the only way I can scratch that\nitch, huh?!\c\nBy destroying you, of course!\nI’m gonna pummel you into little pieces, punk![VAR 0114(0017)]
You destroy everything you can reach, kid,\nand when everything—and I mean everything—\r\nis gone, then you’ll finally see it...\r\nThat’s when you’ll see something new.\c\nLater days, Champion.\n’Cause I’ll keep coming around to fight you until\r\nI’ve found something new of my own![VAR 0114(0017)]

A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oooh! And there’s that Kantonian Meowth!\nLook at that shiny coin on your head, kitty-kitty![VAR 0114(0007)]
Meow?
Meow to you, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, by the way!\c\nThere were some pretty interesting people\nlooking for you, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
So, come on, let’s get out there!\c\nThe Champion of Alola doesn’t get to just stay\ninside all day![VAR 0114(0007)]

Text File : 422
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh, hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Congrats on\nbecoming the Champion![VAR 0114(0037)]
I haven’t quite figured out what a Champion is,\nbut you’re very strong, correct?\r\nI have a favor I must ask of you.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Ultra Beasts have appeared on Poni Island.[VAR 0114(0036)]
They must have come through the Ultra\nWormhole created by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0036)]
And being the Champion means you’re stronger\nthan the island kahuna, right?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Congratulations on\nbecoming Alola’s first Champion.[VAR 0114(0038)]
I heard that the battle against Hau to decide\nthe Champion was quite the spectacle.[VAR 0114(0038)]
So, Champion, as they call you, would you be\nso kind as to give us your assistance?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Ultra Beasts have appeared in the depths of\nPoni Island. They must have traveled there via\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole created at the altar on Poni.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Sadly, we are no match for them... That is why\nwe request your assistance, Champion.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Me and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are gonna go, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Of course. You are two of the best Trainers in\nall of Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We are heading to Poni Island now. Would you\nlike to accompany us?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Of course. We’re counting on you, too, Hau.[VAR 0114(0038)]
We were planning on heading to Poni Island\nimmediately. Would you care to come along?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Of course!
I’ll join up later
All right! Another trip together![VAR 0114(0037)]
Very well. We will meet you both at Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Let us go, then![VAR 0114(0038)]
We will be waiting for you at Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0039)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nOver here![VAR 0114(0007)]
If you head into Poni Grove here, there’re Ultra\nBeasts right here in Alola![VAR 0114(0007)]
My young friend [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nCongratulations on becoming Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I have heard that your final battle against\nMaster Hau was quite fiery.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And now the two of you will look into the\nmysteries of the Ultra Beasts, is that right?\c\nI will support you however I can.\nI’ve brought you both a little something.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My [VAR PKNAME(0001)] loves malasadas, too!\c\nThanks, Ms. Wicke![VAR 0114(0007)]
Young Master Gladion also left something with\nme for you. It is Type: Null.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll also entrust you with all of the memory drives\nneeded to change the type of Type: Null’s\r\nEvolution—the Pokémon Silvally.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
Type: Null...\c\nIt was being researched as a possible weapon\nto be used to fight the Ultra Beasts, but I think\r\na Trainer like you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nMaster Gladion thinks you will be able to show\nType: Null that there is much more to this wide\r\nworld than that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Man, that Gladion...\nHe just doesn’t want to let me win, does he?\c\nWhen he gets back from that training of his,\nI’m definitely asking him for a battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
But now I’m off to Poni Grove![VAR 0114(0007)]
The members of the Ultra Recon Squad were\nalso making for Poni Grove, I believe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But you have so many Pokémon already that\nyou cannot accept Type: Null now.\c\nPlease come collect it when you’re able.\nI will be at Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0016)]

There you are. The Ultra Beasts known as\nBlacephalon are wandering here in Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0036)]
They must be very uneasy being here in a new\nworld. I should know—that’s how I was, too.[VAR 0114(0037)]
...I seem to recall your being beside yourself\nwith excitement, Zossie.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Moving right along, here are some Beast Balls\nfor you! They’re the same ones you can buy at\r\nAether Paradise, but they gave them to us since\r\nthis is an emergency. Isn’t that nice?[VAR 0114(0037)]
For you, too, Hau![VAR 0114(0037)]
Thank you very much for coming. The Ultra\nBeasts, now called Stakataka, are lost and\r\nwandering in Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0038)]
It is my guess that they are distraught... They\nmost likely will attack anything they see.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Here are some Beast Balls. Normally you would\nhave to buy these at Aether Paradise, but they\r\nwere kind enough to give some to us.[VAR 0114(0038)]
For you, too, Hau. Please take these.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Hey, thanks! So, if you’re giving us these balls,\ndoes that mean you want us to catch them?[VAR 0114(0007)]
We want to gather data that will help us protect\nthe Ultra Beasts. If you would accept the\r\nBlacephalon as your partners, it would be of\r\ngreat assistance to us. Oh, and for the record,\r\nit seems there are at least three Blacephalon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
They’re probably nervous, and that makes them\nrowdy! A battle will help them calm down![VAR 0114(0037)]
We leave that to you two. All we wish for is that\nthe Stakataka be able to live peacefully.[VAR 0114(0038)]
We have learned from what happened with\nNecrozma. We must not try to control these\r\ncreatures but focus on protecting them.\c\nIt would put both ourselves and the Stakataka\nat ease if you would capture them.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Sounds good to me! C’mon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s go help the Blacephalon![VAR 0114(0007)]
Sounds good to me! C’mon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s go help the Stakataka![VAR 0114(0007)]
Blacephalon!\nCome out, come out, wherever you are![VAR 0114(0007)]
Stakataka!\nCome out, come out, wherever you are![VAR 0114(0007)]
With our skill level...we won’t be much help in\nresolving anything that might involve a\r\nPokémon battle.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Come out, Blacephalon!\nYou want to go home, too, right?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Our skills at Pokémon battles are woefully weak.\nWe are not nearly able to take on Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0038)]
The Ultra Beast Stakataka is actually composed\nof almost 150 smaller life-forms, which all\r\ncreate one shape. Be wary, Champion.[VAR 0114(0039)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Over here![VAR 0114(0007)]
That Blacephalon was too strong!\nI was nowhere even close to catching it![VAR 0114(0007)]
That Stakataka was too strong!\nI was nowhere even close to catching it![VAR 0114(0007)]
But it will now likely keep itself hidden for a\nwhile, and it won’t attack other Pokémon.\c\nWe can use this time to gather data and to\nwork with the Aether Foundation to capture it.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hau! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You were both amazing![VAR 0114(0037)]
Let’s see... It seems like there are still a few\nBlacephalon wandering around.[VAR 0114(0037)]
No matter! It will likely keep a low profile now\nand won’t attack other Pokémon for some time.\c\nWe can use this time to analyze the data we\ngathered and, with the help of the Aether\r\nFoundation, hopefully capture it.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Yes... It seems there are still some Stakataka\nwandering about.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Gotcha! I’ll be sure to capture one this time and\nhand it over to the Ultra Recon Squad![VAR 0114(0007)]
Blacephalon, whe-e-ere are you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Stakataka, whe-e-ere are you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I would like to avoid these Ultra Beasts’\nbecoming a menace to Alola...[VAR 0114(0036)]
Anyone would want to go home if they suddenly\nfound themselves in a strange world...[VAR 0114(0037)]
I wonder... Would the Stakataka calm down if\nthere were more of their kind around?[VAR 0114(0038)]
We must avoid these Ultra Beasts’ becoming a\nthreat to the Alola region...[VAR 0114(0039)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hau gave us the Blacephalon he caught![VAR 0114(0037)]
This will help us gather data we can use to\nprotect the Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Perhaps a day will come where the Ultra Beasts\nwill live here in Alola as normal Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
More things for us to research![VAR 0114(0037)]
We are grateful for your help. I’m sure we will\nmeet again...[VAR 0114(0036)]
We received the Stakataka Hau was able\nto capture.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Together with the Aether Foundation, we should\nbe able to gather useful data in order to protect\r\nthe Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I expected no less from the two who competed\nfor the championship. You’ve helped us resolve\r\nan extremely delicate situation. We thank you.[VAR 0114(0039)]
We take our leave now. Until we meet again...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Those were some epic battles!\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] had a good time, too!\c\nC’mon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Let’s head home![VAR 0114(0007)]

*gasp gasp*...\nSorry... Let me calm down a bit...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I...I came because I need your help,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0010)]
A bunch of strange guys appeared out of\nnowhere and...and they took over Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0010)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 426

The space here suddenly became all twisted,\nand then the programming of the Plaza was\r\nrewritten! That’s why the castle looks so...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Creepy...
Cool!
You think? It looks so menacing, like where a\nfinal boss would live... I think it looks kinda cool![VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, you get it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Yeah, the way\nit’s so dark and menacing... Whoever did this\r\ncertainly has cool tastes in architecture![VAR 0114(0010)]
Still, they broke through my impenetrable\nsecurity system, even if they did take\r\nadvantage of a system malfunction. And they’ve\r\ntaken complete control of Festival Plaza...\c\nBe careful—these guys know what\nthey’re doing![VAR 0114(0010)]
Please, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ve got to help\nme take back Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks!\nI knew I could count on you![VAR 0114(0010)]
P-please, don’t say that... I really need\nyour help right now, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m glad that you’re with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou’re the Champion, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]

Team Rocket’s Castle is under our control!\nThere’s nothing you can do, whoever you are![VAR 0114(0033)]
Ahahahahahahah!\nMuahahahahahahahaha![VAR 0114(0033)]
It seems like this group calls itself Team Rocket.\nThey definitely don’t seem like nice people...\c\nI can’t believe I’ve allowed Festival Plaza to be\ntaken over by people like them...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Still... He said this castle was under their\ncontrol. What exactly did he mean...?\c\nGive me a sec and I’ll check...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ve got it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... They have some\nsort of program lock that prevents us from\r\nusing the Pokémon in our party![VAR 0114(0010)]
We need to figure out some way to get Team\nRocket out of here, but without using our\r\nown Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0010)]

So many Trainers come and go through Festival\nPlaza! Taking over this place will let us steal\r\nPokémon from all over Alola![VAR 0114(0033)]
The boss took advantage of the distortion\ncaused by the Ultra Wormhole and took over\r\nFestival Plaza![VAR 0114(0033)]
Aah, Team Rocket’s Castle! Just look at that\ndesign! Fit to send the whole world into a vortex\r\nof fear and panic![VAR 0114(0033)]
We’re in cyberspace, right? I didn’t know it was\nthis realistic...[VAR 0114(0033)]
It turns out we can’t use our own Pokémon,\neither. Thank goodness for the Battle Agency.\c\nWe can still use other people’s Pokémon,\nafter all![VAR 0114(0033)]

The Battle Agency...? Oh, of course![VAR 0114(0010)]
Other people’s Pokémon...? Oh, right, of course![VAR 0114(0010)]
If we use the Battle Agency rules, we can use\nother people’s Pokémon to battle! It doesn’t\r\nmatter if we can’t use our own![VAR 0114(0010)]
Just a sec...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Using my admin rights to access the debug\nfeatures... Rebooting the reception program...[VAR 0114(0010)]

That’s unfair! You shouldn’t be able to battle so\neffectively with other people’s Pokémon![VAR 0114(0033)]
Bah... Get ’em, guys![VAR 0114(0033)]
We can’t let you take back Team Rocket’s\nCastle. The boss’s plans depend on it![VAR 0114(0033)]
Just in time...\nFull system restore![VAR 0114(0010)]

Whew... That was close.\n...Thanks for your help, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
You kept them busy just long enough for me to\nget back full admin access...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ve used that access to lock out Team Rocket\nfrom Festival Plaza forever![VAR 0114(0010)]
I also restored all the features and everything to\nnormal, too.[VAR 0114(0010)]
What about the castle?
What about the design?
I...kinda like what they did with the castle.\nEven though they were our enemies...\r\nI’ll add it as one of the themes.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And I’ll set up some boss data that’d be perfect\nfor this kind of castle.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Also... This is for you. You helped me out a lot...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m really glad you came with me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]

Oh, watch this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Meowth picked up a new move recently![VAR 0114(0004)]
Merow!
Meowth turned on the TV!
So graceful! I bet it saw me turn on the TV and\nwanted to try for itself![VAR 0114(0004)]
Mrrff.
...This just in.
The Aether Foundation is holding a press\nconference as we speak, addressing the black\r\nclouds that appeared over Poni Island.
We go now to our live coverage at the scene...

I know that many of you must have heard of the\ndark clouds covering Poni Island on the news...\c\nYou may be feeling concerned now about what\nis going on, but let me put your fears to rest.[VAR 0114(0014)]
This phenomenon was caused by a previously\nunknown Pokémon called Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Necrozma passed through an Ultra Wormhole,\na wormhole that connects different worlds,\r\nand came here to steal Alola’s light.[VAR 0114(0014)]
*chatter chatter*... Necrozma...?\nWhat does she mean, steal our light...?
There is nothing to be worried about, though.\c\nThanks to the actions of one brave Trainer, the\nthreat has already been dealt with.\c\nAlola will not be swallowed by darkness.[VAR 0114(0014)]
*flash flash*
The Aether Foundation will conduct extensive\nresearch into the Ultra Wormholes, so that we\r\ncan prevent any such events in the future.[VAR 0114(0014)]
To be specific, we will begin by—[VAR 0114(0014)]
Wha—?!\nThat hole... How is that possible...?[VAR 0114(0016)]
An Ultra Wormhole?\nBut why now?![VAR 0114(0014)]
Eek![VAR 0114(0016)]
Who...exactly are you, sir?[VAR 0114(0014)]
The technology of the Aether Foundation...the\nknowledge of other worlds—[VAR 0114(0030)]
it will be very useful to Team Rocket...\nor rather...[VAR 0114(0030)]
[VAR COLOR(0001)]Team Rainbow Rocket[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0030)]
Did he mean to suggest that his people created\nthis Ultra Wormhole intentionally...?\r\nWe will not allow this to go unchecked![VAR 0114(0014)]
P-President! Please, come back![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hello? Are you seeing this? The sudden turn of\nevents has left the scene in chaos![VAR 0114(004D)]
Team Rainbow Rocket...?\nIs this some kind of prank?[VAR 0114(004D)]

Oh!\nWhat happened to the TV, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Mreow?
Now, I wonder who that is?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, Alola, Lillie![VAR 0114(0004)]
A-alola, ma’am.\nI’m so sorry to come barging in all of a sudden.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I was just watching the news at the professor’s\nlab, and...and—\c\nDid you see it, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I sure did!
An Ultra Wormhole!
Yes, an Ultra Wormhole opened up in the middle\nof the press conference!\r\nAnd then everything got so confused...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe it was some kind of performance...\c\nI’m sure Mother must be fine, but...still...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I...I’m going to go see what is happening at\nAether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess...I just wanted to let you know.\nSorry again for disturbing you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, did Lillie leave already?\nI thought she came over for a visit![VAR 0114(0004)]
She did look worried, though...\nI hope everything is OK.[VAR 0114(0004)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, everything is a mess!\c\nMother! And Aether Paradise!\nIt’s all... It’s just all so... It’s all gone wrong![VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you OK?
Calm down
I-I’m sorry... I’m just so worried...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s good to see you again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nPlease, let me explain the situation.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As you may know, the president called a press\nconference to address the black clouds that\r\nengulfed Poni Island, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
An Ultra Wormhole suddenly opened, and a\nmysterious force took over her mansion![VAR 0114(0016)]
The culprits call themselves...\nTeam Rainbow Rocket.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve heard of Team Rocket before, when I was in\nthe Kanto region... They were an underground\r\ncriminal organization that used Pokémon for\r\ntheir activities. I think this organization has\r\ncome to Alola now...[VAR 0114(0016)]
And Mother...\c\nWicke says that Mother has been taken captive\nby this Team Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0006)]
I am trying to come up with as many ways to\nsave the president as possible, but...\c\nto be honest, the situation isn’t good. The\nenemy is too powerful, and on top of that we\r\ndon’t even know why they’re interested in the\r\nAether Foundation![VAR 0114(0016)]
I...I want to save my mother.\c\nBut we just aren’t strong enough on our own...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I know this is a lot to ask, but if you could lend\nus your strength, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course!
It’s all yours!
Oh, thank you so much! I feel so much better,\nknowing you’re on our side, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I feel so much better now, knowing you and\nNebby are on our side, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s a swarm of Team Rainbow Rocket\nGrunts ahead. Take this—you might need it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Please, be careful, you two![VAR 0114(0016)]
Of course![VAR 0114(0006)]
I will keep trying to find a way to fight back on\nmy end, too.\c\n...I swear, where has Faba gone to at\na time like this?[VAR 0114(0016)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 435

I will use my full power to help my mother!\c\nYou keep moving on ahead, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI will handle this![VAR 0114(0006)]
Anyone who gets in our way must be destroyed!\nEven if you’re just a kid![VAR 0114(0033)]
What, more foundation members who haven’t\nlearned their lesson? Ahead is the new HQ for\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket! Begone, intruders![VAR 0114(0033)]
Please, leave this person\nto me...\r\nYou should go on ahead, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Argh, how was I supposed to know a kid would\nbe so strong?![VAR 0114(0033)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 436
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
The mansion...it looks like some kind of castle!\c\nIs this also because of the Ultra Wormhole that\nWicke was talking about?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Stop right there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Mr. Faba?! \nWh-what are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I strongly suggest you abandon your efforts to\nthwart Team Rainbow Rocket.[VAR 0114(0015)]
What...do you mean by that?[VAR 0114(0006)]
If Team Rainbow Rocket takes over Aether\nParadise, the organization will grow far beyond\r\nwhere we are today...and more Pokémon will\r\nbe saved![VAR 0114(0015)]
...And if I can assist it in doing so, no doubt my\ncareer will also reach new heights![VAR 0114(0015)]
Such a wonderful thought, wouldn’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Mr. Faba...\nDid...did you...? Y-you wouldn’t...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, as astute as ever, Miss Lillie! The same\nintuition that told you to rescue Cosmog still\r\nserves you well, I see.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yes, you guess correctly! I have taken it upon\nmyself to facilitate Team Rainbow Rocket’s\r\ntake-over and ensure everything goes smoothly![VAR 0114(0015)]
Mr. Faba, how could you?!\nWe...we trusted you! And you—!\c\nThe Aether Foundation is not some tool for you\nto use to move up in the world![VAR 0114(0006)]
You have to make this Team Rainbow Rocket\nstop all this at once![VAR 0114(0006)]
...You may be astute, Miss Lillie, but I see you\nare less inclined to listen to reason.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, even I would be hard-pressed against the\nChampion, especially if Gladion or the grandson\r\nof the kahuna were aiding h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer...[VAR 0114(0015)]
But with you tripping h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer up, perhaps it won’t\nbe so difficult for me to win, even against the\r\nChampion! I thank you in advance, Miss Lillie![VAR 0114(0015)]
Traveling with [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has changed\nme, too! I’ll show you my full power![VAR 0114(0006)]
...As you will.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Then I, Branch Chief Faba, Aether Paradise’s\nlast line of defense, shall show you little\r\nchildren the harshness of the real world![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hmph! I’ll have you know defeating me won’t do\nyou any good, anyway.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The Ultra Wormhole has resonated with the\nboss’s ideology and has gathered the toughest,\r\nmeanest villains from many other worlds![VAR 0114(0015)]
...Although, for now, they seem content just to\ndo whatever research they wish, using the\r\ntechnology of Aether Paradise...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, I hope you enjoy your futile efforts![VAR 0114(0015)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nLet’s move on.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey, I know you... You’re the boss of that\npathetic group that got disbanded—Team Skull!\c\nI wouldn’t expect much from just an Alolan thug.[VAR 0114(0031)]
No vision, no ideals... What does such a\nworthless punk want at Team Rocket’s Castle?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Heh... I gotta admit... You got me all figured out![VAR 0114(0017)]
I got nothin’... Not even my team\nanymore. I’m just another regular nobody...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But! I still got some things I can’t let go...\nThings ain’t nobody gonna mess with![VAR 0114(0017)]
And guess what? You punks just messed with\none of those things! I can’t let that slide...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nGimme a hand here![VAR 0114(0017)]
What?! We’re Team RR! We’re not supposed to\nlose to a kid and a punk![VAR 0114(0031)]
They...they won’t be obliterated![VAR 0114(0032)]
Thank you for helping us, Mr. Guzma![VAR 0114(0006)]

Yes, we do![VAR 0114(0006)]
I got your back! I’ll be right here, and no one’s\ngettin’ through![VAR 0114(0017)]
Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess I’m still not strong enough as a Trainer...\nI’ll focus on healing your Pokémon for now.\c\nIf your Pokémon need help, come to the room in\nthe back![VAR 0114(0006)]

...Or, well, I WOULD interrupt if my Pokémon\nwere still healthy.
We’re no good at remembering patterns. We just\nwanted to make someone else feel the same!

And another interruption! How’s your focus\nholding out?
...Or at least I’d try to interrupt if my Pokémon\ncould still fight!
We’re annoying, right? I know, I know...\nWe’re just doing our job, though.
You got past the glowing floor puzzles?!\nWell, you won’t get any farther!
The boss of Team...what’s-it-called is in this\nroom! Of course, our boss is way more amazing!
You’ve got brains and Pokémon brawn!\nLet’s see how far they’ll get you!
I like our boss, obviously, but the man in here\nalso seems really smart... I kind of like him!
It’s confusing, right? I know how you feel!
Heh heh heh... You messed up! You should give\nup already!
You made a mistake, just as we’d planned!
I’m just a plain old Grunt, hangin’ out here.\nDon’t mind me! Go on, solve the puzzle!

Here I thought it was that obnoxious Faba,\ncoming to pester me again, but...[VAR 0114(0030)]
All this ruckus was caused by a child?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am Team Magma’s Maxie.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I had finally realized my grand design, only to be\nswallowed by a great fissure that appeared\r\nbeneath me... When I awoke, I was in this world.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I’m enjoying this experience so far, though.\nThe knowledge in this world is...fascinating.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I do intend to return to my own world eventually,\nbut first...[VAR 0114(0021)]
I have decided to bring my grand design to this\nworld, as well![VAR 0114(0021)]
I will use the magma-controlling power of the\nContinent Pokémon Groudon to shrink the\r\noceans and create more glorious landmass![VAR 0114(0021)]
With more dry land to live on, the creatures of\nthe land will no longer have to fight for territory![VAR 0114(0021)]
This is the ideal world for people and Pokémon!\nA world without conflict! Don’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Do you mean to interfere with my plans?\nYou are just like that fool from Team Aqua.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I can’t allow an ignorant child like you to get in\nour way. I, Maxie, will show you the\r\nconsequences of meddling![VAR 0114(0021)]
So you defeated the master of the land—\nthe great Maxie! Still, I wonder...\c\nWhat makes you so adept at handling Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0021)]
There has to be some reason I was defeated...\nThat’s what you’re trying to say, aren’t you?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nHmph... You think I didn’t know that? This isn’t\nmy own world, after all.[VAR 0114(0021)]
If you truly wish to continue farther into Team\nRocket’s Castle, there are two paintings that\r\nyou will need to examine.\c\nOne red, and the other blue.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I have my noble cause! To expand the\nlandmass, for the advancement of humankind\r\nand Pokémon! This is where we part![VAR 0114(0021)]

All right, you lot! Just as we planned, let’s gang\nup on the intruder and let them have it!\c\nYaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Wha—? Why?! C’mon, guys, we said we’d attack\ntogether, didn’t we?
Sorry, sir—we just...couldn’t get the timing right!
Well...I guess our only option is to reveal our\ncontingency plan!
At the same time...now...\n...Retreeeeeeat!
We’re not letting you through, no matter what!
Nuh-uh! No passage!
We are not mere Grunts... We are an invincible\nwall that stops any intruder!
Hey, don’t touch me! You can’t just force your\nway through!
Stop right there! You’re not allowed beyond\nthis point!
We’ll show you Team RR’s real power!
Just give up and go home, already!
I’ll happily be a wall if the boss wants me to!
My arms...are getting a bit tired...
None shall pass!
I hope this is worth the trouble!
If we let you through, we get our\npay docked!
Please, just go home!
The realization of Team RR’s grand plan is\nresting on our shoulders!
So you got through the Grunt walls, did you?
Nothing unexpected! Let’s do this, just as\nwe planned!
Brace yourself! Hyaaaaa...
Huh? I thought this was supposed to be a\npincer attack! Why am I all alone?!
Blast, our plan has failed! No matter, I’ll stop you\nby myself!
Seriously though, where did the others go?\nI hope they’re not lost somewhere...
Oh, hey... Well, this is awkward...\nUh, do you think you could still battle me?
We were all ready to ambush you, and I had to\nstep on a warp panel. It’s a shame an Escape\r\nRope doesn’t let you escape embarrassment...
Well, that was embarrassing...\nI still am going to battle you, though.
Nothing goes well for me working as a Grunt.\n...Maybe I should just go home and live with\r\nmy parents.
I’ll stop you right here! No need for my\nsupervisor here to worry himself!
If you’re good enough to defeat my supervisor,\nit’s not surprising I couldn’t beat you.
Let me show my underling how it’s done!
The boss in this room here, he’s almost like\neveryone’s older brother. He has a way of just...\r\npulling everyone around him together, y’know?

Just when I completed my great plan, I got\nswallowed up by a giant wave...\c\nAnd when I came ’round, I was in this world.[VAR 0114(0022)]
The boss of Team RR was kind enough to let\nme use this room as my own.\c\nI’ve been tryin’ to figure out a way to get back\nto my own home.[VAR 0114(0022)]
And I do want to go back eventually, but I find\nmyself thinkin’...[VAR 0114(0022)]
maybe I should make this world more like my\nideal while I’m here anyway![VAR 0114(0022)]
I’ve got the Sea Basin Pokémon, Kyogre...\nWith its power to control the rains, I’ll call down\r\na great deluge to wash away this world’s land![VAR 0114(0022)]
All life is born from the sea! If we help the\nocean expand, we’re creating the cradle for\r\nfuture life to grow and thrive![VAR 0114(0022)]
The best possible future for both people and\nPokémon, don’t you think?![VAR 0114(0022)]
Oh? So you want to get in my way, just like that\nbuffoon from Team Magma.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Well then, you little scamp...\nIt’s the rope’s end for you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0022)]
Well, would you look at that!\c\nI control the ocean and all its power, and yet\nhere I am, beaten by a little tyke![VAR 0114(0022)]
All right, all right... You’ve made your point.\nI can see you’re not one to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(0022)]
If you want to get farther into Team Rocket’s\nCastle, though, you’d better have checked out\r\nthe pictures hanging on the walls.\c\nThe red one, and the blue one, too.[VAR 0114(0022)]
It makes me wonder... If there was a Trainer like\nyou back in my old world, would I have ever\r\nbeen able to pull off my great dream?[VAR 0114(0022)]

...My name is Cyrus.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I would like to ask you one question.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Is this world the new world?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Maybe?
I don’t know
I can sense in you the strong desire to protect...\nsomething. You have a powerful spirit.[VAR 0114(0023)]
...That must mean this isn’t the world I desired.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I used the power of the Pokémon that control\ntime and space to create a perfect world,\r\nwhere the human spirit does not exist.[VAR 0114(0023)]
That was when a great shadow appeared and\nengulfed me... And brought me to this world.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Is that a Pokédex...? May I have a look?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Zzzt?[VAR 0114(0035)]
Interesting... In this world, even the Pokédex is...[VAR 0114(0023)]
The Rotom Dex wazzz made to help Trainerzzz![VAR 0114(0035)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0023)]
...I see. So you have a spirit, as well.[VAR 0114(0023)]
But it’s too late... All too late. I cannot stop now.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I must remove the weak, incomplete human\nspirit from this world and bring it perfection![VAR 0114(0023)]
How foolish...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I will not let anyone get in my way...[VAR 0114(0023)]
...Why are you able to create such strong bonds\nwith your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0023)]
And how are you able to turn those bonds\ninto strength?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Don’t you get it?\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] izz kind to all Pokémon![VAR 0114(0035)]
...I see.[VAR 0114(0023)]
...You need not worry, Rotom. I will not do\nanything to this world. I believe I shall return to\r\nthe perfect world I created.[VAR 0114(0023)]
But before that...take this key.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Use it to activate the machine on the wall\nbehind me. That should open the mirror door.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Had I met you sooner...would things have been\ndifferent for me...?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Do you want to use the Galactic Key?
Let’s use it!
The machine has already been activated!
The Galactic Key broke...

The Meowth statue is looking straight ahead.
There is a button on the back of the Meowth\nstatue. Would you like to press the button?
Let’s push it!
BEEP! BEEP!\nIntruder alert! Intruder alert!
You’re back at the entrance...
You may have been able to get past the\nMeowth statues, but you can’t get past me!
The man in the room here made us bring in two\nhuge switches. I wonder what they’re for?
Yeesh! You should just turn 360 degrees and\nget out of here!
How do the Meowth statues send you back to\nthe entrance of the room, anyway?

You must be the intruder I keep hearing about.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am Lysandre.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I had triggered my ultimate weapon to wipe out\nall the fools—everyone except Team Flare...\c\nBut at that moment, a bright light swallowed me\nand I wandered into this world.[VAR 0114(0025)]
No matter. My purpose remains the same.\nWhich world I’m in is not important.\c\nThe only way to create a world where people\nlive in beauty, a world without conflict or theft...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Behind me, you see two buttons.[VAR 0114(0025)]
One will open the path for you, and help you\nmove forward...[VAR 0114(0025)]
The other will trigger my ultimate weapon, and\ndestroy all that there is in this world![VAR 0114(0025)]
...So, make your choice.\c\nI believe being a chosen one means you have\nthe potential to change the future! Whether we\r\nactivate the ultimate weapon or leave it safely\r\nunderground will rest upon if you actually have\r\nthis potential or not.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Do you want to press the blue button?
You pressed the blue button!
Do you want to press the red button?
You pressed the red button!
The button has already been pressed.
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Unfortunately... You are not a chosen one![VAR 0114(0025)]
You will destroy the world you tried to protect,\nby your own hand![VAR 0114(0025)]
However... There is still time before my ultimate\nweapon is fully activated.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Press the other button before it fires, and you\nwill be able to stop it.[VAR 0114(0025)]
...Of course, I refuse to allow that. So, I will keep\nyou busy for a moment.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The future you want, or the future I want...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let us see which one is more deserving,\nshall we?[VAR 0114(0025)]
The strength to protect, huh?\n...Very well. Go on, press the button.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You have stopped my ultimate weapon, and also\nyou have taken one step more toward your goal.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Maybe...if my world had a Trainer like you, the\npath I chose could have been different...\r\nNo! Nothing can change me now! If there is a\r\npath to creating a beautiful world, then that is\r\nthe path I must take! Even if it means I can only\r\nsave a handful of the old world![VAR 0114(0025)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)], look![VAR 0114(0006)]
The hidden door behind the mirror is unlocked,\nand now we can use the warp panel![VAR 0114(0006)]
I knew you could do it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHere, let me heal your Pokémon first...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well now, what do we have here...?\nI come out wondering what the commotion is...[VAR 0114(0030)]
only to find the door to the center of the castle\najar, and intruders running wild!\c\nIt seems those team leaders from other worlds\nare not nearly as useful as I had hoped.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Who are you?! Where is my mother?!\nYou haven’t harmed her, have you?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Mother, you say...? I see, you’re the daughter of\nthe president.[VAR 0114(0030)]
My name is Ghetsis.\nI am representing Team Plasma.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I, too, was summoned from another world, much\nlike the other leaders you’ve defeated![VAR 0114(0024)]
There is no need to worry.\c\nYou will find the president up ahead, blissfully\nasleep and dreaming.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, not so fast![VAR 0114(0024)]
Please get out of my way![VAR 0114(0006)]
Unfortunately, I cannot let you go beyond\nthis point![VAR 0114(0024)]
You see, I have been thinking long and hard\nabout the reason I have been sent to this world.\c\nAnd now...I believe I finally have the answer![VAR 0114(0024)]
My purpose... It is to travel between the worlds,\nfreeing all Pokémon from foolish people...\c\nAnd at the same time, consolidate all the power\nin all the worlds to myself![VAR 0114(0024)]
In order to achieve this beautiful ideal, however,\nI have need of a useful pawn...[VAR 0114(0024)]
And that man, the leader of Team Rocket, is a\nman of pure evil![VAR 0114(0024)]
If I can make good use of him, and set him up as\na king, I shall be able to reign supreme above\r\nall existence![VAR 0114(0024)]
I have found that humans, with their predictable\nambitions, are easier to use and control than\r\na freak without a human heart.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It wouldn’t do at all to have you get in his way,\nespecially when I must establish him as my king![VAR 0114(0024)]
Must you insist on interfering with my plans?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Very well, then... All obstacles to my ambitions\nmust be removed![VAR 0114(0024)]
What?![VAR 0114(0024)]
I created Team Plasma with my own hands.\nI’m absolutely perfect! I AM PERFECTION!\c\nI am the perfect ruler of a perfect new world![VAR 0114(0024)]
You lost.\nNow please, step aside![VAR 0114(0006)]
This cannot be possible... I will not accept this![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aaaugh![VAR 0114(0006)]
Myah-ha-ha! No, no, no, no, no! You don’t get\nit, do you? I can’t be defeated! I won’t be!\c\nIT. CANNOT. BE. ALLOWED![VAR 0114(0024)]
You, tiny intruder! If you value this girl’s life,\nthrow aside all your Poké Balls, at this moment![VAR 0114(0024)]
Y-you cowardly...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please!\nDon’t listen to him![VAR 0114(0006)]
Shut your mouth![VAR 0114(0024)]
What’s this? Your Poké Balls are shaking! Could\nit be that they’re shaking with rage?\c\nNo matter! Throw away all your Poké Balls, right\nthis instant![VAR 0114(0024)]
All right...
I refuse!
Myah-ha-ha-ha! Good, good... That’s a good\nlittle [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl. Do as your elders command you!\c\nVictory only suits perfect leaders, after all...\nSuch as myself![VAR 0114(0024)]
Were you not listening, or did you simply not\nunderstand? Well, you leave me no choice.\r\nThis girl must...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I see you are still dedicated to your own\ndesires, Ghetsis...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Y-you![VAR 0114(0024)]
It has been a while.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Miss Lillie, it is good to see you again. We ran\ninto each other in the lab, perhaps you recall?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Mr. Colress...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. We meet again![VAR 0114(002B)]
Ms. Wicke had sent word that you may need\nassistance. You’ll have to forgive my\r\nrudeness, but I followed your trail using an\r\ninvisibility device I recently invented.[VAR 0114(002B)]
It seems Ghetsis here has caused you quite\nsome trouble![VAR 0114(002B)]
Although it appears this Ghetsis is from a\ndifferent world than the one I know.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Of course... The Colress of this world! But you\nshould have no reason to meddle in my plans![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh, please...[VAR 0114(002B)]
I simply despise you, Ghetsis. That’s enough\nreason for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
What’s this...? My body is being pulled...[VAR 0114(0024)]
No...NOOOOOOOOOOOO![VAR 0114(0024)]
It seems like repeated use is not a problem,\neven with the prototype. I should have known\r\nColress Machine No. 1102 would work![VAR 0114(002B)]
Thank you for helping us, Mr. Colress![VAR 0114(0006)]
But what did you do to that man?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I simply adjusted his dimensional “channel,” if\nyou will, and sent him back to his original world![VAR 0114(002B)]
But Ghetsis is a man with power to match his\nambition! He is not someone to be taken lightly.\c\nI can only hope that the taste of defeat will\nkeep that Ghetsis out of trouble in his world...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Y-yes...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But turning Aether Paradise back to its original\nform...[VAR 0114(002B)]
With all the different worlds mixing together,\nthat won’t be easy, even for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
There is tremendous power of evil at the center\nof the castle... If we can remove that man’s\r\ntwisted desires, the Colress Machine should be\r\nable to revert everything back to normal...[VAR 0114(002B)]
You mean Team Rocket’s boss? If we can do\nsomething about him, everything will be fixed...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed, Miss Lillie! You are a very sharp\nyoung lady![VAR 0114(002B)]
I would like to study this castle, however, so I\nleave the rest to you two![VAR 0114(002B)]
This castle... Oh, of course! Necrozma’s power\nto open Ultra Wormholes overflowed and\r\nresonated with intent of tremendous evil,\r\ntwisting reality and causing this to appear![VAR 0114(002B)]
The vortex of power somehow...summoned the\nevil leaders, such as Ghetsis, from their worlds![VAR 0114(002B)]
It’s all very interesting... Ah, I mean, quite a pain.\nI could put this power to much better use![VAR 0114(002B)]

Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, well...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I had been informed of the intruders, but not\nthat they were kids like you![VAR 0114(0030)]
I had allowed the other bosses to do as they\nwished, hoping they would be of use...\c\nBut it seems you have defeated all of them.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am impressed you got here.[VAR 0114(0030)]
So you... You’re Team Rainbow Rocket’s—[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed![VAR 0114(0030)]
Team Rocket’s goal was to use all the Pokémon\nand control the world. But now, I have a bigger,\r\nbetter organization. Team Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0030)]
And I, Giovanni, am its leader![VAR 0114(0020)]
Mother! Are you OK?! Mother, please answer![VAR 0114(0006)]
The president will not awaken for some time.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I have used the power of that Ultra Beast to\nmake her sleep...[VAR 0114(0020)]
And when she awakens next, she will be a loyal\nservant to my will![VAR 0114(0020)]
What?!\nHow...how could you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Team Rainbow Rocket will conquer all worlds!\nWe will build an army of UBs![VAR 0114(0020)]
But in order for this precious dream to be\nrealized, we need the technology of the Aether\r\nFoundation—the technology of other worlds![VAR 0114(0020)]
...But I also appreciate the skill it took you to get\nthis far.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I like those who show strength! Why not\nput that strength to good use, in my\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Hah! You are calm enough to joke, I see.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Ha! Of course that would be your answer.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Having a kid stand in front of me like this...\nSuch a thing should never happen. But for some\r\nreason, it also makes me feel nostalgic.[VAR 0114(0020)]
If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will make\nyou feel a world of pain![VAR 0114(0020)]
...I see you have raised your Pokémon with\nutmost care.[VAR 0114(0020)]
It would be foolish to fight such a kid with all\nmy might.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Ha, very well. I will leave Aether Paradise in\nyour hands.[VAR 0114(0020)]
But remember, my Team Rainbow Rocket will\nnever fail![VAR 0114(0020)]
Never forget that![VAR 0114(0020)]
I shall step aside this time! I hope we\nmeet again...[VAR 0114(0020)]

The castle... It’s gone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
The Colress Machine has been activated, and it\nrestored the mansion to its original form...\r\nWhich means...you’ve done it!\r\nYou defeated Team Rocket![VAR 0114(002B)]
Mr. Colress! And Mr. Guzma![VAR 0114(0006)]
Took you long enough![VAR 0114(0017)]
For a Trainer such as you, who can bring out\nPokémon’s power through your bonds, it must\r\nhave been easy.[VAR 0114(002B)]
The defeat of Team Rocket’s boss seems to\nhave sent everyone who had come with him\r\nback to their own worlds.[VAR 0114(002B)]
As for me... I have decided on the next theme\nof my research![VAR 0114(002B)]
Well then, I hope to see you again sometime.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Mr. Colress...\nHe’s a truly great scientist, isn’t he?\r\nThough he is also so very strange...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ngh... Where am I...?\c\nLillie...? And...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Madam Prez![VAR 0114(0017)]
Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] defeated Team Rocket for us![VAR 0114(0006)]
What! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe did?!\nIt must have been terribly dangerous...[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe did! It was really amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it seems you’ve saved\nthe day once again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I am truly grateful.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Mr. Faba![VAR 0114(0006)]
Buagh![VAR 0114(0015)]
P-P-P-President! I-I’m glad you’re safe![VAR 0114(0015)]
I still feel a bit dizzy, but...\c\nWhat of you, Faba?\nAre you unhurt?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh, yes, of course! No need to worry yourself\nabout me, President! I’m just glad you’re safe![VAR 0114(0015)]
Mother! Mr. Faba was—[VAR 0114(0006)]
N-now, now, Miss Lillie! You must still be rattled\nfrom all the confusion and chaos caused by\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0015)]
I would never do such a thing as betray the\nfoundation and invite Team Rainbow Rocket in,\r\njust to advance my career![VAR 0114(0015)]
Branch Chief Faba.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Oh, and about Mr. Faba...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, Faba! Put your back into it!
Urrrrgh! Why must I be the one doing such\nmenial, mundane chores?![VAR 0114(0015)]
Come on, Intern Faba! We don’t have all day!
I-Intern?! Please, don’t call me by that title![VAR 0114(0015)]
I don’t think he will return to the position of\nbranch chief anytime soon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey! Ms. Wicke! Please, help me just a little![VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh, right away![VAR 0114(0016)]
I will see you later![VAR 0114(0016)]
Aether Paradise is back to business as usual.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I was worried about Mother, and just terrified of\nthose Team Rocket people...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But to be honest, having another adventure with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nit was a lot of fun.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I really, really am grateful![VAR 0114(0006)]
When I do my own island challenge, it would be\ngreat if I could do it with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]

But I guess now it’s time for me to go!\nI’ll see you again soon![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, and before I forget! Here, take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 20]
I imagine Team Rainbow Rocket planned to use\nthose as funding. They hid a whole bunch in the\r\npresident’s room. They’re all yours![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hah... That [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl had quite some talent...[VAR 0114(0020)]

Hello.\nI’m Lana.\c\nI serve as the captain of Brooklet Hill.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So, trial-goer...\nWill you be attempting my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Definitely!
Not yet
Oh, really?\nI will be waiting, in that case.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Then I will explain the trial to you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
My particular trial is this...\c\nI want you to herd the Pokémon found in the\npools of Brooklet Hill, driving them downstream\r\nto draw out the Totem Pokémon.\c\nIf I might be so blunt, they are Wishiwashi.\nIt’s Wishiwashi I want you to herd.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But I won’t expect you to swim through all the\npools yourself. I have a lovely gift to help you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able\nto travel over bodies of water.\c\nNow you’ll be able to help drive those Pokémon\ndownstream for me![VAR 0114(000D)]
So if you’re ready...\nPlease follow me this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]

So you made it...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Ah...\nI’m sorry. What was your name?\c\n... ... ...\c\nOf course! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIt is a lovely name. Just lovely.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, then.\nDo you see those two splashes over there?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I am thinking that at least one of them might\ncontain a Wishiwashi.\r\nIn fact, it’s likely both might. Don’t you agree?\c\nWould you try to drive them downstream with\na little help from Lapras?[VAR 0114(000D)]
The Wishiwashi fled downstream, heading\ndeeper into Brooklet Hill...
Well, this is a lovely surprise!\nYou’re quite the Trainer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nPlease carry on driving the Wishiwashi\ndownstream just like that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That splash there!\c\nPlease do check that vigorous splashing and\nkeep driving the Pokémon downstream for me.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Very well done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nPlease come back this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What a very surprising surprise...\c\nWho would have thought it?\c\nThat all those Wishiwashi gathering would have\nsummoned an Araquanid, that is.\c\nHeh heh...\nEven I was caught—hook, line, and sinker![VAR 0114(000D)]
You were amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And I have more than just that to offer you.\nAnother token for clearing my trial...\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you\nfish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
By the way...\c\nDid you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You did?!
Did you really?
Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Good. Let’s be going, then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well.\c\nThe siren call of the sea...\nand the urge to fish up something wonderful![VAR 0114(000D)]

What is it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nDo you need to leave so that you might prepare\nyourself better for my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]

Defeat the totem to prove your skill to me.\c\nAnd...well, you may find that using Grass- or\nElectric-type moves will be to your advantage.\c\nOr you could always resort to using an\nX Sp. Def or two, or perhaps a Dire Hit.\c\nDo not let your guard down.\nThe totem is not to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Then, please go ahead and drive those frisky\nPokémon downstream to call out the totem![VAR 0114(000D)]
So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou bowed out of the trial of Lana.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Yes, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou’ve found me again.\c\nWould you like to attempt my trial once more?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Definitely!
Not yet
Oh, really?\nI will be waiting, in that case.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Good. Then to review my trial’s requirements...\c\nI want you to drive the Wishiwashi found in the\npools of Brooklet Hill downstream, in order to\r\ndraw out the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Good. Then we should head downstream to\nmeet the totem![VAR 0114(000D)]
If you’re ready, please follow me this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Welcome to Lush Jungle, the trial grounds for\nme, Mallow![VAR 0114(000E)]
You ready to get in some hot water?\nMy trial is ready for you, if you’re ready for it![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m ready!
I’m not ready
Then come back when you think you’re ready![VAR 0114(000E)]
I knew it the first time I saw you and your team...\c\nYou’ve chosen only the finest ingredients![VAR 0114(000E)]
You are the one who got a Sparkling Stone\nstraight from Tapu Koko, aren’t you?\c\nI totally get it now.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Ah, the breath of the jungle...\c\nI can tell just what today’s special should be...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yup! It’s gotta be!\c\nMy secret specialty: the Super Mallow Special![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m gonna need you to find three ingredients\nfor me!\c\nI’ll need a Mago Berry, some Honey, and a\nBig Root![VAR 0114(000E)]
Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold\nall the ingredients you’ll gather for your trial.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you just tossed all the trial ingredients in your\nown Bag, it would make something all right...\r\nSomething like a Mallow Mess, I guess![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s go and find the first ingredient right away![VAR 0114(000E)]
Geez, those Fomantis...\nI wonder if they could tell how strong you are?[VAR 0114(000E)]
You can find Mago Berries around here.\c\nBut you’ll also find Fomantis living here, ’cause\nthey love Mago Berries, too.\c\nIf you take a Mago Berry that the Fomantis had\ntheir eyes on, they might not take it too kindly![VAR 0114(000E)]
When you’re done gathering ingredients here,\njust let me know![VAR 0114(000E)]

Looks like you bit off more than you could\nchew in my trial, huh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Lush Jungle has some tough Pokémon, it’s true.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nNow get back in there and do your best![VAR 0114(000E)]
Lush Jungle’s totem is tough, it’s true.\nLurantis is a tricky opponent.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nAnd don’t forget to factor in the effects of the\nweather!\c\nIf the sunlight has turned harsh, some Grass\ntypes can regain HP or use powerful moves\r\nfrom out of nowhere![VAR 0114(000E)]

You’ll need to find a Mago Berry for me.\c\nBut you’ll find a lot of a certain Pokémon\ncalled Fomantis living around here.\c\nThey tend to live in trees that are dripping\nwith Honey.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You can harvest Honey from the flowers that\nbloom here in the jungle!\c\nBut you’ll also find plenty of Pokémon where\nthere are lots of flowers![VAR 0114(000E)]
A Big Root, huh?\nYou can find them near the trees deep in the\r\njungle that look kind of like Sudowoodo!\c\nBut you’ll also find that some of the trees that\nlook like Sudowoodo ARE actually Sudowoodo!\r\nGood luck and watch out![VAR 0114(000E)]
So, about that ingredient...\nYou sure that’s the one you want to grab?\c\nIf any Pokémon had their eyes on it, you\nmight be taking something the Pokémon thinks\r\nbelongs to them. And then they may come\r\nattack you later.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll be fine!
O-oh...
If you have to think that hard about it,\nthen maybe try somewhere else, hmm?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Then it’s on to the next ingredient!\nChop-chop! Let’s keep moving![VAR 0114(000E)]
When you find the ingredients you’re sure you\nwant, come show them to me, OK?[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], that’s what I like\nto see!\c\nSince you’ve got all the ingredients, let’s head\nback to the entrance.[VAR 0114(000E)]

People say Pokémon are lured in by flowers and\ngather around them.\c\nWatch out when you see a bunch of flowers if\nyou don’t want to get attacked![VAR 0114(000F)]
These ingredients are important for this trial,\nbut they’re also very important to the Pokémon\r\nthat live in Lush Jungle.\c\nThis Thick Club I’m going to give to Mallow, too,\nwas the result of serious effort on the part of\r\nmy Marowak and I.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Mallow’s trial... Let’s hope she doesn’t take\nthings too far.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Are you here for\nMallow’s trial, too?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yup
Why do you ask?
Oh, I was just taking a guess. Looks like you got\nlured in, too, huh?\c\nI came because Mallow asked me to bring her\nsome Fresh Water.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Heh heh. Mallow asked me to bring her some\nFresh Water, so here I am.\c\nI wanted to have a look around here for a\nBig Root that I could use as a fishing rod\r\nanyway, though.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m sure a fresh-faced Trainer like you will be\nable to find a nice, fresh Big Root in no time![VAR 0114(000D)]

Let’s see that Mago Berry first![VAR 0114(000E)]
Cuh-cuh!
Oops! You went and took the Mago Berry that\nFomantis had its eye on, didn’t you![VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, then. Let’s put this Mago Berry into\nthe pot, and...\c\nThere! We pour in the Fresh Water that Lana\nbrought us![VAR 0114(000E)]
Next up is the Honey![VAR 0114(000E)]
Cuh-cuh!
Com com com!
Well, Fomantis sure does love its Honey![VAR 0114(000E)]
You brought the Honey that Comfey was hoping\nto sip up, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now we mix the Honey in using the Thick Club\nthat Kiawe brought along...[VAR 0114(000E)]
And last but not least, the Big Root![VAR 0114(000E)]
Woooooo!
Those Sudowoodo! They like to put Big Roots\naround their feet to look more like real trees.\r\nI guess this one wanted its Big Root back![VAR 0114(000E)]
And finally, it’s finished...with one last pinch of\nmy super-special secret spice![VAR 0114(000E)]
Ta-da! The Super Mallow Special!\nIt’s all done and it smells delicious![VAR 0114(000E)]

And you got all the ingredients without even\nbattling any Pokémon!\c\nAs the captain, I really appreciate your looking\nout for the Pokémon living here in the jungle![VAR 0114(000E)]
You battled your way through the Pokémon\nliving here in the jungle to get me the\r\ningredients I need.\c\nYou and your [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there make a\nfabulous team![VAR 0114(000E)]
Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park, my\nMarowak didn’t stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Nor did the Araquanid that I had trained\nso carefully...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, looks like you’ve cleared all three of\nAkala’s trials!\c\nAn amazing Trainer like you, who even cleared\nmy super-hard trial, definitely deserves this![VAR 0114(000E)]
You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Grassium Z is yours!
Let me show you how to use Grass-type\nZ-Moves! You go, like, “Graaassss!” OK?\r\nHere, watch me![VAR 0114(000E)]
Since you’ve cleared my trial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nwhy don’t you try raising some Pokémon from\r\nLush Jungle? Here, have some Nest Balls![VAR 0114(000E)]
Huh? Hey, Lurantis didn’t finish its food! Well,\ncan’t let it go to waste. Lana, Kiawe—you guys\r\nshould have some![VAR 0114(000E)]
Huh? Umm... I’m pretty full right now...\c\nI, uhh... I just ate a Berry. Yeah.[VAR 0114(000F)]
And that food you cooked is suited to\nPokémon’s taste buds, right?\c\nI think it’s probably best to save it for when\nLurantis wants some more...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Y’think? Olivia always says she thinks\nit’s delicious.\c\nI think people would enjoy food cooked for a\nTotem Pokémon, too. Your guys’ loss![VAR 0114(000E)]

OK, when you’re ready, just come talk to me...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Wow, you’re really into this... OK, let me explain\nhow my trial works.[VAR 0114(0010)]
First, you need to connect the Charjabug that\nare on the Roller.[VAR 0114(0010)]
We’ll use the electricity from the Charjabug to\npower up the machine... That should let us call\r\nthe Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Use the four buttons on the edges of the Roller\nto rotate the panels, and connect the Charjabug\r\nin a line.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Just as an example, this is what happens when\nyou rotate the panels.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You don’t need to worry about which way the\nCharjabug are facing, so long as they’re\r\nconnected in a line.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Let me summarize. We connect the Charjabug to\nsummon the Totem Pokémon, which you will\r\nhopefully defeat.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Also, as a side note, this is the first time we’re\nusing the two machines, the Roller and\r\nthe Pinger.[VAR 0114(0010)]
So let’s get this trial going, OK?\nMy trial is about to begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
Sophocles’s trial will tickle your brain, I promise\nyou that![VAR 0114(001C)]

Now we’re ready to power up the Pinger![VAR 0114(0010)]
Tekyu![VAR 0114(003A)]
Yes... It’s working... The electricity from the\nlinked Charjabug is moving along the cable...[VAR 0114(0010)]
It’s actually working... The Pinger is getting a\ngood dose of power![VAR 0114(0010)]
Now...the Totem Pokémon should be\nhere any minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
Bzap!
Ah, of course. Elekid love electricity, too. It must\nhave been tempted out by the Pinger.[VAR 0114(001C)]
We didn’t call the Pokémon we wanted, but it\nseems like the Pinger works just fine.\c\nSo, what now, Soffy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hmm, I think one row of Charjabug isn’t giving\nit enough electricity...[VAR 0114(0010)]
If that’s the case, all we need to do is add\nanother circuit![VAR 0114(0010)]
If my theory is correct, this should let us pump\nmore power into the Pinger!\c\nSo, my trial will continue, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]

Yes! We’re getting much more power than on\nour last try![VAR 0114(0010)]
Buzzzzzap!
Hm... Electabuzz. It seems like the more power\nwe pump into the Pinger, the bigger Pokémon\r\nit attracts. This is amazing, Soffy![VAR 0114(001C)]
If that’s the case, let’s give it some more power!\nThat’ll definitely summon the Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(001C)]
The more Charjabug we connect in a direct\nline, the greater the electrical current that is\r\ngenerated, and the longer it flows...[VAR 0114(0010)]
So that means—[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ve got it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Actually, I think\nyou’ve got it already, too.\c\nSo, my trial will continue to continue![VAR 0114(0010)]

Uh, the cables are looking a little unstable...\nI hope it doesn’t cause a problem...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh no... The Charjabug will get blasted with\nelectricity if we don’t do something![VAR 0114(0010)]
T-Togemaru! What are you doing?!\nAre you trying to save everyone?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Togedemaru’s Ability is Lightning Rod. It can\nattract electricity to itself. But...the current is\r\ntoo strong! There’s no way Togedemaru’s\r\nelectric sacs can handle all of it![VAR 0114(001C)]

Thanks, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
Togemaru and company... They were saved by\nthe Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
The Totem Pokémon is really something else!\nAnd that means you’re one heck of a Trainer\r\nto have beaten that totem, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m curious, though. What is that aura that the\nTotem Pokémon surround themselves with?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I really need to work on the totem-calling\nmachines, though... Togemaru, and Onejabug\r\nand company—they’re all my precious friends.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’ve got that right, Soffy. Finding things that\nyou notice, even little things, and improving on\r\nthem... That’s how science works. Come to think\r\nof it, that’s how Pokémon battles work, too![VAR 0114(001C)]

Here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI’ll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for\nbeating the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Come on, Soffy—you still need to show h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer the\nproper Z-pose to use it![VAR 0114(001C)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\n...Watch.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Congratulations on clearing your trial!\c\nAnd Sophocles did well as captain, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I was really nervous...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
But you were really great, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]

So I take it you’re ready to take my trial, right?\nYou did come to my house like I said, after all.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s why I’m here!
That’s not why I’m here!
What, really?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Heh heh heh...\c\nThen let the trial of Mina begin![VAR 0114(0012)]
I guess I’ve got to tell you what you need to do.\nYou have to battle me![VAR 0114(0012)]
Phew! Looks like you have had some kind of\nisland challenge!\c\nSince you managed to beat me, though, I’ll give\nyou this Pink Petal as proof.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s a good start.\nBut you’ve only just begun my real trial.\c\nNow you have to go around to all the captains\nin Alola and get a petal from each one of them![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m here to help you out, though. Come on, tell\nMiss Mina which captain you want to find, hm?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ilima
Lana
Kiawe
Mallow
Sophocles
Acerola
I’m good
Ilima, huh?\nHe’s usually up on Route 2, right?\r\nThat’s where Verdant Cavern is, after all.\c\nIf you have trouble tracking him down, try to\nfind a Trial Guide to ask. That might help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Lana’s usually out in Brooklet Hill, yeah?\c\nThough she visits Lush Jungle a lot, too.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If Mallow ever has free time, she’ll be in Lush\nJungle looking for ingredients for her cooking.\r\nFor sure.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Kiawe? Hmm. Probably off dancing somewhere?\nWith those Marowak of his.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If you want Sophocles, you’ve gotta check the\nHokulani Observatory, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Acerola can be found at Aether House!\nI know that one for sure![VAR 0114(0012)]
Why, I almost didn’t recognize you!\c\nYou practically look like a different person than\nthe kid who took on Ilima’s trial back then!
If you’re looking for Ilima, he’s off in Hau’oli\nCemetery right now.
Hey, trial-goer! Are you looking for Lana?\nI’m afraid she’s not here right now.
The captain went off to Lush Jungle again!
Alola!\nLet me guess—you’re here for Mina’s trial?\c\nIf you need to find Kiawe, he should be with\nhis Marowak up in Wela Volcano Park.
If you’re looking for Captain Mallow, she’s out\nnow collecting ingredients for her cooking.\c\nYou remember the best place for that, right?\nExactly! It’s Lush Jungle!
Oh? Are you attempting Mina’s trial, perhaps?\c\nIf you are, you should go on up to Aether House!
Hey! Did you need something from me?\c\nIf it’s Ilima you’re looking for, he’s off in Hau’oli\nCemetery right now.

Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.\c\nIt seems you’ve collected a great number of\nZ-Crystals, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nYou are positively shining![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yes, it’s important to always shine.\c\nYou know, I’ve traveled the world since I was\nyoung with my mother.\r\nShe’s an actress on the stage, you see.[VAR 0114(000C)]
In doing so, I came to realize something.\c\nI realized how beautiful my mother was\nwhen she dedicated herself completely to the\r\nrole she was performing onstage...\c\nYes, it is moving to see such complete\ndedication—to anything![VAR 0114(000C)]
The brilliance of the Z-Crystals!\nThe gleam of Totem Stickers!\c\nIn my role as captain, I just want to do my part\nto make everyone shine![VAR 0114(000C)]
But...let’s set all that aside. You’re here for\nMina’s trial?\c\nThen allow me to check just how strong you\nhave become![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yes please!
No thanks!
In a sense, this is a trial for me as well. A trial to\nsee if the strategy I’ve thought up will work![VAR 0114(000C)]
Understood. I’ll take a bit more time to develop\nmy own strategies as well.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You— No, you and your Pokémon have become\nquite a delightful team![VAR 0114(000C)]
Please take this Orange Petal. It has a definite\nwarmth to it, just like me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So now it seems you have two petals.\c\nWouldn’t you like to see what happens when\nyou have collected all seven?[VAR 0114(000C)]
You know, Hau has been out on Mahalo Trail\ndoing nothing but training and has improved a\r\ngood deal![VAR 0114(000C)]
For now, though...\nShould I see you to the next captain?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Please do
I’m good
Shall we, then? To Lush Jungle!\nIt’s been a while since I last visited Akala.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Please do let me know when you’d like to go to\nLush Jungle.[VAR 0114(000C)]

Wela Volcano Park...\nHot as ever, huh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’m glad we could travel together like this.\c\nPlease have a good time with Kiawe.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Lana...\nHow about a Bubble Beam from Araquanid?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Alola!\nNow who am I?
The Hiker
The best Hiker
The same old Hiker
The suspicious Hiker
Good to see you again!
You looking for Kiawe?\nHe’s...oh! Right there!
Thank you for filling in for me while I was away,\nmy good Hiker.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You never even have to ask, bro!\c\nNothing better than dancing up here on the\nvolcano with my main Marowak and you!
Yes... That’s exactly the sort of intense training\nthat made me who I am today.[VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s why I was thinking that you might be a\ngood candidate to become the captain after me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I think you should let someone who really wants\nto be captain take the job, bro.\c\nI’m not the type who can help trial-goers or\nthe Marowak live up to their full potential.\c\n’Cause all I really want to do is bust a move!
Is that so?[VAR 0114(000F)]
You’re here for Mina’s trial, right?\nWould you like to burn in battle with me?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course
Sounds painful
B-but why?![VAR 0114(000F)]
Being thrilled by an opponent’s excitement...\nNothing makes me want to battle more![VAR 0114(000F)]
Astounding![VAR 0114(000F)]
Alola!
My Hiker friend was so pleased by your right\nanswer that he simply had to battle you![VAR 0114(000F)]
See? I can’t stop myself from wanting to dance!\nI’m just not the type who should be a captain.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you were spectacular!\c\nYou were so spectacular that I will give you\nthis flaming-hot Red Petal![VAR 0114(000F)]
The energy that burns through Wela Volcano\nburns through us as well![VAR 0114(000F)]
If you’re hoping to complete Mina’s trial, you\nshould make for Hokulani Observatory next.\r\nSince you’re here, shall we go together?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Yes please
No thanks
Then, let’s be gone in a flash![VAR 0114(000F)]
I see. Come talk to me again if you do want to\ngo to the observatory together later.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You can’t just dance to somebody else’s tune,\nyou know? Be yourself, and strut your stuff!\r\nI know I’d rather be footloose and fancy-free!

Ahh![VAR 0114(000E)]
Fey fey!
*munch munch*
Ahhh... Aromatherapy...\c\nI feel so relaxed whenever Comfey hits me with\nit... Like all my worries just waft away...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you sure you should relax quite so much,\nMallow? I quite like it when you’re full of energy.\c\nYou’re much less likely to be startled by an\nunexpected visitor when you are.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?![VAR 0114(000E)]
When did you get here?![VAR 0114(000E)]
N-not that it matters.\c\nI was just trying to get closer to my Pokémon\nto see what kinds of special dishes they might\r\nlike me to make for them. That’s all![VAR 0114(000E)]
Like I thought, true relaxation might be out of\nthe question for you, my spry Mallow.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I can so relax!\nYou know I can, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Sure you can
Heh...
Oh, geez! You two!\nI’ll show you! I’ll prove it in battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
Prove it, then
Now hold on a sec!
Why should I?\nI want to have a battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
Now I understand why the Mallow Special is\nquite so special. Heh heh...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now that my Pokémon have me feeling all\nrelaxed...take our all-out attack![VAR 0114(000E)]
Awww, I lost...\c\nGuess now I’ll have to get my Grass-type\nPokémon to make me feel all better again...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, like you can talk, Lana!\nYou’re not the one in hot water![VAR 0114(000E)]
Poor Mallow is feeling bashful. But I know how\nto guarantee you keep what you saw a secret.[VAR 0114(000D)]
A battle? You’re on!
A battle? Hold on!
Oh dear, Mallow.\nIt looks like your secret might be out...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I knew you would take my bait, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI don’t really mind if you tell Mallow’s secret.\r\nNot as long as I get to battle you![VAR 0114(000D)]
Here, take this Green Petal!\c\nI’m only giving it to you because you’re doing\nMina’s trial, though! Not because I’m trying to\r\nget you to keep secret what you saw here!\r\nThat’s a total coincidence![VAR 0114(000E)]
And take this from me...\nA Blue Petal.\c\nDid you know? The Blue Petal is the same\nshape as one of Wishiwashi’s scales.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’re going to Kiawe’s place next?\c\nDo you want to go to Wela Volcano Park with\ntwo pretty pals like us?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Pretty please!
Pretty much no
Well, that was quite the vigorous answer!\nLet’s definitely go to the volcano together.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Traveling with someone is like a Destiny Bond,\nhuh? It really ties you together somehow.\r\nIf you ever want to go with us, say the word![VAR 0114(000E)]
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I have to say...\nyou are quite the catch.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Lush Jungle... Yes, I still remember the frightful\nshock of that special dish...[VAR 0114(000C)]

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThanks again for doing that favor for me before.[VAR 0114(001C)]
It sure seems like you’ve gotten to see some\ninteresting things on your island challenge.\r\nIt’s been quite the experience for you![VAR 0114(001C)]
I know! Why don’t you two have a little battle\nnow, while I can still watch?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Mm-hmm.\nI’ve gotta show Big Mo how strong I can be...\c\nAnd I did say that we should battle next time,\nright, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m ready for you!
I’m not ready...
OK, well, I’ll be waiting...[VAR 0114(0010)]
The island challenge... It sure is nice.\c\nYou can reach so many new places thanks to\nthe Pokémon partner you’ve got beside you.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Tog![VAR 0114(003A)]
I believe in my Pokémon’s strength...\c\nI trained them together with Big Mo, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]
That was amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou know about as much about Pokémon\nbattling as Big Mo...[VAR 0114(0010)]
You both did very well!\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing how far you both\nwill make it in the future.\c\nSoffy... The observatory is all yours now.[VAR 0114(001C)]
It’s time for the next generation to start taking\ntheir place among the stars, I guess.\c\nSo, Soffy...\nHokulani Observatory is all yours now.[VAR 0114(001C)]

Big Mo...[VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nYou came for Mina’s trial, right?\nHere’s your Yellow Petal.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I can do this. No, I will do it.\nI’m a tough kid! I’m a tough kid![VAR 0114(0010)]
Is he really gone?
You gonna be OK?
Yeah...\nHe’ll come back. It’s not forever.\c\nHe said that he had something he had to do\nfor Professor Kukui, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’ve gotta finish Mina’s trial, right?\nDo you want me to take you to the next stop?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Yes please
No thanks

Oh, you [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl...\nFinishing up your island challenge, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Acerola’s out at the moment.\nThink this old man’ll do in her place?\r\nI’ll only hit as hard as she would’ve done.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You want to take me on, boy?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You want to take me on, girl?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do I ever!
Not really
You think I’m just made of free time, huh?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hmm. All right, then.\nNice and gentle...[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got me good, kid.\nHope I don’t get in trouble with the girl for this.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Here. Take it.\nIt’s the only reward you’ll get from me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I suppose I ought to take you on in Acerola’s\nplace, huh?\c\nBut that boy Hau got me good when I tried to\nbattle at about Acerola’s level, so I don’t feel\r\nmuch like bothering again.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So here. Just take it.\c\nAcerola left me some of these, so have one.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You should go tell that young filly Mina that\nyou’re done with what she asked you to do.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Hey, howzit! You feel like taking a little trip\nacross the waves with Mantine?\c\nThis is the [VAR LOCATION(0000)] Surf Spot.\nJust tell me what I can help you with. 
What’s that board there?
Teach me how to surf!
Nothing, thanks
That board over there is what we call a\nranking board.\c\nThat’s where you can see the highest-ranked\nsurfers at each Surf Spot.\c\nYou ought to go riding the waves with Mantine,\ntoo, and see if you can nab that No. 1 spot!
We’ve got some great waves again today,\nhere in Alola.\c\nYou should definitely jump on Mantine there\nand try to get a real high score!
Huh? You can’t mean that you seriously forgot\nhow to surf on Mantine?!\c\nOK, little friend. Don’t you worry.\nI’ve got you covered!\c\nIt does take a little while to cover all the basics,\nthough, so you sure you’re ready to start now?
Then here we go!
I’d be happy to share my little lesson with you\nanytime, so come back whenever you’re free!
You know, I bet you could probably even master\nthis move now...
You learned the aerial move Lanturn 360!
You learned the aerial move Primarina Twist!
You learned the aerial move Starmie 720!
Pull off a Lanturn 360 when the waves are\nhigh, and you can try to nab an even higher\r\nscore than you’d get with other moves!
Pulling off a Primarina Twist when the waves\nare pretty low will net you more points than\r\nusing other moves would do.
The Starmie 720 is a real cool move that you\ncan use on any kind of wave to try to rack up\r\nsome big points!
Use that new move and master the waves,\nlittle cousin!
Tell me about moves
Gorebyss Spiral
Huntail Spiral
Lanturn 360
Primarina Twist
Starmie 720
Over-the-Gyarados
Magikarp Splash
Never mind
Which move do you want to learn about?
The Gorebyss Spiral is a great move to\ntry out while you’re in the air anyway.\r\nTry it out once, when you’re pulling other tricks!
The Huntail Spiral is a great move to\ntry out while you’re in the air anyway.\r\nTry it out once, when you’re pulling other tricks!
The Over-the-Gyarados is a killer move\nthat boosts your score from the last jump\r\nyou pulled off, too!\c\nBut if you use it twice, then your score doesn’t\ngo up anymore—it goes down!
The Magikarp Splash is a move that you can pull\noff when you fail to pull off any other moves.\r\nCrazy, right?\c\nTry to get a real high score by using it just\nonce. That’s the trick!
You’ve dominated every single surfing course!\c\nYou should definitely swing by the local branch\nof the Surf Association. It’s in Heahea City.
Eeeh! Eeeh!

Alola!\nI am the official Name Rater!\c\nI can more or less tell your Pokémon’s fortune\nby its name.\c\nWant me to rate the nicknames of\nyour Pokémon?
Which Pokémon’s nickname should I rate\nfor you?\c
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)], is it?\c\nYou picked quite a fine nickname.\c\nBut I think we could give it something even\nbetter. What do you say?
I see! What would you like the new nickname\nto be?\c
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\c\nYou’re right, that does seem to fit it better.\nNicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change\nyour mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is vastly superior!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
Now, now...\nThat is merely an Egg!
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!\c\nIt reminds you of the time when you first met\nthe Pokémon!\c\nCome see me again if you want to give\nPokémon nicknames.

Wait... Is that...?\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\nYou brought it from the Kalos region, right?\c\nSomeone like you can take pictures against the\nrefined backdrop of Kalos’s Lumiose City!\c\nYou can see its famous tower and enjoy the\nelegance of its shop fronts and streets.

Oh?\nYou’re originally from the Kanto region, right?\c\nI’ve traveled around tons of different regions,\nso I can easily tell something like that!\c\nAnd not just for people, either. I can tell which\nregion your Pokémon came from, too.
Do you want me to take a look and tell you if\nany of your Pokémon are from other regions?
Hmm... Let me see...

The screen says “Alola Photo Techniques That\nEvery Trainer Must Know!” Want to take a look?
Which topic would you like to read about?
Introduction
1. Picking your poses
2. Placing your Pokémon
3. Changing directions
4. Operating the camera
5. Taking the best shot
I’m done here
“I want to take amazing photos and show them\noff to the rest of the world!”\c\nIf you agree, read on to master five techniques\nyou’ll need to start taking pro photos in no time!
First and foremost, imagine what kind of photo\nit is you want to capture!\c\nThink about all the different poses you could\nmake, and try to decide what you want to do.\c\nThis is a good time to imagine which Pokémon\nyou’d like to appear with you in the photo.
While you’ve got an image in mind, next decide\nwhere you should place your Pokémon.\c\nAs you move your Pokémon about, consider how\nit’ll look in relation to your pose and position.
Once you’ve settled on your Pokémon’s position,\nturn it to decide which direction it should face.
Operate the camera like a pro to capture a\nshot exactly as it looked in your imagination!\c\nIt will be crucial to first move the camera to face\nthe direction you were imagining.\c\nOnce you’ve got it in the right place, use the\nzoom functions so your subjects look spot-on!
If you’ve made it this far, you’re in the home\nstretch! Once your Pokémon makes an action...\c\nThat’s it! Slam that shutter to catch that\nperfect pose for your perfect picture!\c\nOnce you get the hang of all that, also keep\nin mind how background images move, too.\c\nIf you can do all that, you’ll be a real pro! There\nare lots of backgrounds, too, so have a look!
That was a great photo shoot! Would you like to\nmove right ahead to adding some stickers now?
Then let’s open up your album...

Uh...\nNow who was I again?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nOh yes! I’m the Move Deleter!\nI can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You’re here so I can make your Pokémon forget\na move, um-hmm?
Which Pokémon would that be?
Just remember me when there’s something you\nwant to forget!
What’s that, friend?\nThat Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What’s this, friend?\nEggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm...\nAnd which move should it forget?
It was a great success!\c\nYour Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even\nknew [VAR MOVE(0000)]!
Everyone calls me Madam Memorial.\c\nI know every move that a Pokémon learns as it\ngrows, you see.\c\nI can also help your Pokémon remember any of\nthose moves that it has let go in the past.\c\nI’ll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves\nin exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a\nlong-forgotten move?
If there’s a move you’d like one of your Pokémon\nto remember, bring me a [VAR ITEM2(0000)]!
Which Pokémon is it?
That is an Egg.
This Pokémon doesn’t yet have any moves to\nbe recovered.
Which move would you like it to remember?
You gave a [VAR ITEM2(0000)] in thanks.
Now it has remembered that move!\nCome again if you need anything else!

There is no move that I can teach to any of the\nPokémon you are with...
I see...\nWell, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be then?
That Pokémon can’t learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?!\nYou are being unreasonable.

The strongest Dragon-type move is called\nDraco Meteor.\c\nDo you want me to teach the move to\nyour Pokémon?
I understand... Moves that are too strong\ncan be difficult to use.
This Pokémon could learn this move, but\nthere is one condition that needs to be met.\c\nThat is...the Pokémon has to be completely\nfriendly toward you.\c\nI can teach the move only after the Pokémon\nbecomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can\nlearn this move...\c\nPlease come back when you obtain a Pokémon\nthat can learn this move!
Then please select the Pokémon that will learn\nthis move.
Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg.\nI can’t teach the move to an Egg.

Let me guess! You want me to teach Dragon\nAscent to your Pokémon. Am I correct?
You don’t seem to have Rayquaza—the only\nPokémon that can learn Dragon Ascent.
Come back anytime you need my help.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach\nthe move to?
That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent.\nOnly Rayquaza can learn the move.

I’m devoting what’s left of my life to helping\nyoung Trainers grow.\c\nI’d like to teach the ultimate moves to\nas many successors as I can.\c\nIs it all right to teach them to your\nPokémon, too?
Would it be all right if I taught your Pokémon the\nultimate moves?
Young Trainer, the Pokémon with you can’t\nlearn these moves.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, feel free to come visit me\nanytime you want.
Well, please tell me which Pokémon I\nshould teach.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon can’t learn an\nultimate move.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.

Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center.\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center.\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center!\nStill hard at work today, are you?\c\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Morning, Champ!\nWelcome to the Pokémon Center.\c\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center.\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center!\nStill hard at work today, huh, Champ?\c\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
I’ll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thanks for waiting!\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0000)] should be all better now!
Thanks for waiting! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] and the\nrest of your team should be all better now!
We hope to see you again!
Happy birthday!\c\nI hope you’ll keep visiting the Pokémon Center\nfor many years to come!\c\nNow, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected\nwith the Pokérus.\c\nLittle is known about the Pokérus, except that\nit is a microscopic life-form that attaches itself\r\nto Pokémon.\c\nWhile infected, Pokémon are said to grow\nexceptionally well.
Happy birthday, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Each and every day!
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nToday is a special day!\c\nI know it’s a day early, but happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your\nPokémon’s HP is getting low.\c\nAnd if you’re planning to go far off the beaten\npath, you should probably remember to stock\r\nup on Potions from the Poké Mart, too.\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy!\nGood luck and take care!
Welcome home, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLooks like that could’ve gone better, hmm?\nWell, get some rest before you head out again.\c\n...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s more like it! Now you and your Pokémon\nare both bursting with energy!\c\nBut, you know...when your Pokémon run out of\nenergy and their HP starts getting too low...\c\nWell, it’s just common sense for a Trainer to\ngo back home and let them recover. OK?\c\nNow get out there and have some fun![VAR 0114(0004)]

Go on and choose how many of your Poké Beans\nyou’d like to put into the Poké Bean crate.[VAR 0114(002F)]
The Pokémon will be delighted to see them![VAR 0114(002F)]
There are still some Poké Beans from last time.\nWait till they’re all gone, then you can add more.[VAR 0114(002F)]
It’s best to put some Poké Beans out when\nthere are Pokémon around to enjoy them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Did you want to do something?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve already sent out one bottle today.\nThe limit is just one a day! Fair’s fair![VAR 0114(002F)]
Then I’ll put seven of your Plain Beans into a\nBean Bottle and set it adrift. That OK with you?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have the Poké Beans for that!\c\nBut that’s an easy enough problem to solve.\nJust pick some up on Isle Abeens![VAR 0114(002F)]
Mm-hmm! There we go![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ve sent the Bean Bottle bobbing out in the sea!\nI hope it’ll catch us some nice luck today![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’m afraid you haven’t got enough Pokémon in\nyour Boxes yet for me to develop that isle.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you don’t have enough Plain Beans\nyet for me to develop that isle, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(002F)]
Order received!\nThen I’ll get straight to work![VAR 0114(002F)]
[~ 13]
Yeah, I think we could do that![VAR 0114(002F)]
Decide how many of your rarer Poké Beans\nyou’d like to exchange for Plain Beans.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have space for so many Plain Beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’m sorry but you don’t have any of the special\nPoké Beans I’m looking for in a trade, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nIf you find a Patterned Bean, then I can give\nyou three Plain Beans for it.\c\nIf you find a Rainbow Bean, I’ll give you seven![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have enough Plain Beans just now.\c\nYou’ve got to put seven Plain Beans in a Bean\nBottle to set it adrift. That’s just manners!\c\nWhy don’t you go see if you can find any to\npick up on Isle Abeens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0002)]You obtained [VAR NUM3(0000)] Plain Bean[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s![VAR BE05(0003)]
Which Berry would you like to plant?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nI’m looking forward to that Berry harvest![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any\nBerries to plant.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You wouldn’t want to plant any Berries if you’ve\ngot no Pokémon about to help tend to them!\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and put them in\nyour Boxes, that’s a good [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0000)]Looks like your Pokémon found some treasure\nduring their little adventure. Here you are![VAR BE05(0001)][VAR 0114(002F)]
Too bad. It looks like your Pokémon haven’t\nuncovered any treasure so far.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Will you pick a path to explore?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThen it’s time to explore that cave!\c\nI wonder if they’ll find any treasure, hm?\nHo, I just can’t wait to see![VAR 0114(002F)]
You can’t send anyone to explore the cave if\nyou don’t have any Pokémon on the isle!\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and put them in your\nBoxes if you’d like them to have an adventure![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to call your Pokémon back from\nthe current expedition?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Everybody back!\nWe’re calling it for this expedition!\c\nJust tap on the sign and let me know if you want\nto send your Pokémon out to explore again.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you don’t have any Pokémon who are\nprepared to go out into that cave for you...\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any Pokémon out exploring now!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
Think you could clear out that treasure crate for\nme before we send any more Pokémon out on\r\nanother adventure?
Choose the Pokémon that you’ll send out\nto play on the play gym![VAR 0114(002F)]
And what kind of drink would you like to make\nyour Pokémon? Hydration is key![VAR 0114(002F)]
How many play sessions should your Pokémon\ncomplete this time?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nLooks like we’re ready to go!\c\nI bet your Pokémon will have a great time.\nPlaying, getting stronger, and having a blast![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like a real fun time is being had, I’d say![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to make your Pokémon quit in the\nmiddle of their play?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Everybody back!\nPlaytime is over for now!\c\nAnd just tap on the sign whenever you want to\ncollect your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Did you come to collect your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ll just want to check the play structures before\nwe bring more Pokémon in to play.\c\nSorry, but could you collect all of your Pokémon\nso I can give it a quick look-over?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Looks good.\nAll the equipment is in working condition!\c\nJust tap on the sign whenever you want to\nlet some more of your Pokémon loose to play![VAR 0114(002F)]
Your Boxes are full of Pokémon!\nGoodness gracious!\c\nIf you want to collect your Pokémon, you’ll need\nto make some space for them first.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any Pokémon out playing on\nthe play equipment now.\c\nWhy don’t you start by inviting some Pokémon\nto come play here on the isle?[VAR 0114(002F)]
The play session has wrapped up, I’d say.\nTuckered your Pokémon right out, we did!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans while your\nPokémon play so that they have a snack ready![VAR 0114(002F)]
Choose the Pokémon you’d like to invite to relax\nin the hot spring![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ll send [VAR PKNAME(0000)] to your Box then.[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment!\c\nBut your Boxes are full of Pokémon and there’s\nsimply no room for it!\c\nThink you could organize your Boxes a bit and\nfree up a space for it?[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
I think this Egg’s still got a little while to go\nbefore it’ll be ready to hatch.[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg still looks like it’s a quite a while away\nfrom hatching.[VAR 0114(002F)]
It’s always a nice idea to put out Poké Beans\nin the crates after you invite Pokémon over.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis will really help with the ol’ motivation![VAR 0114(002F)]

Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis should make things even more relaxing![VAR 0114(002F)]

[VAR BE05(0004)]Berries will grow twice as fast now![VAR BE05(0005)][VAR 0114(002F)]

Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nBut I suppose I should introduce myself, eh?\nHa ha, how rude of me!\c\nYou can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Glad to see you again!\nThis is it: Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nAnd you remember me? You can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
And you are...[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nOK!\nThen let’s get things started![VAR 0114(002F)]
The Pokémon that you’ve deposited in your PC\nBoxes can freely come here to Poké Pelago to\r\nhave a bit of fun whenever they want.\c\nRight now we only have one small isle available\nfor them to play on, but if you’ll help me out,\r\nthat won’t be true for very long!\c\nSo here’s what you need to do first.\nWould you pick up the Poké Beans that have\r\nfallen to the ground around the island?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Pokémon love Poké Beans.\nThey’re delicious and nutritious!\c\nAnd they can also sprout into Poké Beanstalks,\nlike that one in the middle of the island.\c\nThe one you just picked up is a Plain Bean.\nThere are also rare Poké Beans called Patterned\r\nBeans and even Rainbow Beans!\c\nI love hands-on learning. Don’t you agree?\nSo why don’t you give that Poké Beanstalk a\r\ngood shake and see what happens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Shake the beanstalk to drop some Poké Beans!\nPick up the Poké Beans to add to your stores!\c\nOK, now you’ve got it!\nSee! Isn’t it better to learn by doing?\c\nYou can collect Poké Beans once a day or so.\c\nIf no new Poké Beans come tumbling down,\nthen wait a day and then try again![VAR 0114(002F)]
Put some of the Poké Beans you collect into the\nPoké Bean crate on the island, would you?\c\nThen they’ll be handy for any hungry Pokémon\nwandering around the island to eat anytime![VAR 0114(002F)]
Yup! That’s a Poké Bean crate right there!\nYou can drop Poké Beans in there, and the\r\nPokémon will love you for it.\c\nEspecially here on Isle Abeens. Leaving Poké\nBeans in the crate here can even tempt wild\r\nPokémon to come by for a gander and some fun.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh, yes! One more thing! The rarer kinds of\nPoké Beans will have their effects last longer.\r\nYou might want to remember that fact!\c\nBut as long as you fill the crate up, then you’ll\nprobably be A-OK. Don’t you worry!\c\nAnd if you ever want to talk to me about things,\nno need to feel shy.\r\nThere’s a button right there for my raft hut...\nLet’s push it![VAR 0114(002F)]
Wonderful to see you again!\nI’m delighted to welcome you to my raft hut!\c\nThis has been my own private castle ever since\nthat fateful day when I decided to turn these\r\nuninhabited islands into a resort for Pokémon.\c\nI built this place myself and it’s not too shabby,\nif I dare say so myself.\c\nI have everything I could need here to keep\nPoké Pelago up and running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’ve got a favor to ask of a promising Trainer\nlike yourself.\c\nPoké Pelago only features one small island at\nthe moment, as you’ve seen.\c\nIf you were to liken it to a Pokémon, it would be\na Lv. 1 babe just hatched from its Egg!\c\nSo I’d like you and your Pokémon to put some\neffort into developing the islands here![VAR 0114(002F)]
Developing the isles here basically means\nbreaking ground on new isles or improving the\r\nfacilities on isles you already have started on.\c\nWe’ll borrow the strength of the Pokémon you\nhave in your Boxes to do the work.\c\nOh, and we’ll need some Plain Beans!\nDon’t forget those!\r\nNo one can work well on an empty stomach![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThat’s it from me right now.\c\nBut come see me in my Raft Hut anytime\nthat you want some help developing isles![VAR 0114(002F)]
Mohn here!\nI keep things running here at Poké Pelago.[VAR 0114(002F)]

The Poké Beanstalk has gotten larger, so you\ncan probably get more Poké Beans from it now!\c\nI bet more wild Pokémon will come by, enticed\nby its offerings.\c\nThe Pokémon all look quite eager!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That Poké Beanstalk is truly formidable.\nI’ll bet you get even more Poké Beans now!\c\nAnd even more wild Pokémon coming by to play\nand to marvel at it, too!\c\nYour Pokémon look eager to check it out, too.\nThanks for helping improve Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Aplenny!\c\nI used that nice flat bit of land there to make\na field where you can plant your Berries.\c\nNow your Pokémon can enjoy tending to Berry\ntrees and harvesting Berries here![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thanks to your Pokémon’s hard work, we’ve\nbeen able to expand the Berry fields!\c\nNow you can grow up to 12 different types of\nBerries at a time.\c\nIt should also be easier to water the seedlings\nnow, so I bet your harvest might increase, too!\c\nYour Pokémon look delighted with the new field.\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
Now Isle Aplenny is completely covered with\nBerry fields!\c\nYou can plant and grow up to 18 different\ntypes of Berries now.\c\nAnd it’s even easier to water the seedlings,\nso I bet your harvest will increase more, too!\c\nThanks for helping Poké Pelago grow![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Aphun!\c\nThere’s a big cave on this island, so now your\nPokémon can explore it and have adventures.[VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve excavated further and made some new\npaths through the cave!\c\nYour Pokémon might be able to find some rare\nstones if they explore the new path.\c\nThey look pretty pumped up for an adventure!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
The paths through the cave have increased!\nNow your Pokémon can explore deep into the\r\nisland’s underground!\c\nThey might find some real treasures in there!\c\nI’d say your Pokémon look thrilled to explore!\nThanks again for helping develop Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you say?\nThis is Isle Evelup!\c\nThere are logs and things to climb, and a nice\nsandy area to play in and exercise with.\c\nNow your Pokémon can help themselves to\ngrow stronger while they have fun![VAR 0114(002F)]
We have some new play structures for your\nPokémon to play on!\c\nNow you can invite up to 12 of your Pokémon\nhere to play at a time.\c\nI bet your Pokémon will be delighted!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve used the driftwood that was buried in\nthe beach to make even more equipment!\c\nYou can now have up to 18 Pokémon playing on\nthe equipment here at one time.\c\nI’m sure your Pokémon will be delighted!\nThanks for all your help developing Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Avue!\c\nI’ve used the warm water that wells up beneath\nthis island here to make a hot spring bath!\c\nYour Pokémon will be able to relax and get\nreal cozy here.[VAR 0114(002F)]
We added another hot spring bath to the isle!\c\nNow you can have up to 12 Pokémon enter the\nbaths at once.\c\nAnd the fountain that provides the water is\nalso bigger, so I bet your Pokémon will be able\r\nto relax even better in the abundant water.\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty cozy to me!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
Now all of Isle Avue has been converted to\nhot spring baths!\c\nYou can have up to 18 Pokémon in the baths\nat once now.\c\nThe fountain where the water flows from looks\nquite magnificent now, and your Pokémon will\r\nbe feeling relaxed in no time, I’d say!\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty cozy to me!\nThanks for helping develop Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! If you want to plant some Berries,\ntap the sign and let me know!\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty happy.\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! If you want your Pokémon to\nexplore one of the cave’s paths, tap the sign\r\nand let me know!\c\nAnd if they find anything while they explore,\nI’ll have them leave it in that treasure crate\r\nthat’s in the middle of the island.\c\nYour Pokémon look thrilled to get out there!\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! Check out the sign there and you\ncan decide which Pokémon you want to invite\r\nto play here at Isle Evelup!\c\nI’ve also prepared some special drinks for the\nPokémon playing here at Isle Evelup.\c\nJust a little treat from me for the hard workers!\c\nAnd you should choose a drink you’d like to\nshare with your Pokémon when you’re deciding\r\nwho you want to call out to play.\c\nYour Pokémon will be delighted!\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]

Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nHmm? Hold the phone!\c\nYou don’t seem to have any Pokémon in your\nPC Boxes, now do you?\c\nPoké Pelago is a resort designed to entertain\nthe Pokémon you deposit in your PC Boxes.\c\nWhy don’t you put some Pokémon in your Boxes\nand then come visit us again?
Looks like you’ve got more than 30 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing more Poké Beans then.\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you’ve got more than 90 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing a lot of Poké Beans then!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you’ve got more than 150 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing whole piles of Poké Beans!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 30 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 90 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 150 or so Pokémon\ntucked safely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon you’ve deposited in your\r\nPC Boxes.\c\nHmm? Hold the phone!\c\nYou don’t seem to have any Pokémon in your\nPC Boxes, now do you?\c\nWhy don’t you go catch a bunch of Pokémon\nand put some in your PC Boxes before you\r\ncome visit us again?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve got everything you need to develop an\nisle for Poké Pelago! Did you know that?\c\nStop by my Raft Hut and check it out![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve done it! Poké Pelago has been fully\ndeveloped into its final, perfect form!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nI know this isn’t much, but I hope that you’ll\ntake it as an expression of my gratitude![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0002)]You obtained 10 Rainbow Beans![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR 0114(002F)]
I hope you’ll continue to use Poké Pelago to\ngreat effect with your Pokémon!
Oh! This’ll be your first Bean Bottle, won’t it?\c\nYes, a Bean Bottle is just what it sounds like:\na bottle that has Poké Beans in it.\c\nBean Bottles sometimes wash up to onto the\nshore here at these isles.\c\nThey must have been set adrift by someone\nelse out in this wide world, which is connected\r\nall over by the great oceans!\c\nPeople set these bottles adrift hoping that they\nmight bring some happiness to the person\r\nwho finds one!\c\nIt’s a pretty romantic idea, isn’t it?\nAnd that’s A-OK in my book![VAR 0114(002F)]
If you bring happiness to someone else, then\nmaybe something good will happen to you, too!\c\nThat’s why it never hurts to do something nice\nlike setting a Bean Bottle adrift in the ocean.\c\nBut you can only send out one Bean Bottle per\nday, I’m afraid.\c\nHappiness that can be bought cheaply might\nend up inviting unhappiness instead![VAR 0114(002F)]
Poké Beans can come in special varieties called\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans.\c\nYou can sometimes find these rare Poké Beans\non Isle Abeens, if you’re lucky.\c\nThey are absolutely delicious, so your Pokémon\nwill be delighted if you feed one to them![VAR 0114(002F)]
In fact...I’ll let you in on a little secret.\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans are in fact\r\nsome of my favorite foods, as well!\c\nThey have delightful flavor and just the right\namount of chew.\r\nOnce I start eating them, I can’t stop myself!\c\n... ... ...\c\nHey now, please don’t look at me like that...\c\nI’ve been working here managing Poké Pelago\nfor a very long time and it’s a really tough habit\r\nto break![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nSo let’s trade some beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
[~ 242]
So you’ll help me! Thank you, thank you.\nAnd now that we have that settled...\c\nOK then! There are five isles total that you can\ndevelop here at Poké Pelago!\c\nEach one will require you to have a different\nnumber of Pokémon in your Boxes and\r\nPlain Beans in your coffers![VAR 0114(002F)]
Check what it says that you need to develop\neach isle in its summary, OK?\c\nOK then! If that’s all clear, you just tell me\nwhich isle you’d like to develop next![VAR 0114(002F)]
Anyway, you don’t need to worry yourself about\nmy diet. This is all you need to know:\c\nI’ll give you three Plain Beans for each\nPatterned Bean you offer me.\r\nAnd seven Plain Beans for each Rainbow Bean!\c\nSo what do you say to a little trade?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like there’s no more space to plant any\nBerries in that field!\c\nWhy don’t you harvest some of your ripe Berries\nand free up a little space to plant in?[VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve done it! It’s the perfect Poké Pelago\nI’ve always dreamed of! You’ve done it!\c\nOK!\nThis is fantastic!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nPoké Pelago now belongs to you and your\nPokémon, I’d say!\c\nI hope you’ll continue to use it to great effect![VAR 0114(002F)]
It looks like it’s going to be a good long while\nuntil this Egg hatches.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks to me like you have plenty of Plain Beans.\nLet’s trade when your stores have gone down.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve come at just the right time!\nThis Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
You should add some Poké Beans after you’ve\nplanted a few Berries first![VAR 0114(002F)]
The Bean Bottle was sent adrift out to sea![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to leave Poké Pelago?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThen come back soon![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Abeens now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Aplenny now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Aphun now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Evelup now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Avue now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]

I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nI help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers\nlike you.\c\nLately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon\nholding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it?\c\nIf you want us to take care of your Pokémon,\nplease speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola, Champion!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine!\c\nThey really seem to like hanging out!

Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine! They don’t seem to like each other\r\nvery much, though.
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine! They don’t seem to like playing\r\ntogether, though.
Oh hey!\c\nI have surprising news for you!\c\nYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\c\nIt’s like a total mystery where it came from,\nbut you want the Egg your Pokémon was\r\nholding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon\nNursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh your party is full...\c\nPlease come back again after making space for\nthe Egg.
I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it,\ndon’t you?
Then I’ll take it.\nThank you.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nWe can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\nWhat would you like to do?
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\nChampion, what would you like to do?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be\nable to battle.\c\nPlease come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly.\nThat’s an Egg!
All right. I’ll take care of your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nfor a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don’t you?\nDo you want to take one back?
[~ 25]
If you want your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back now,\nit will cost you $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)].
You don’t seem to have enough money...
You took back your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] from the\nPokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh...\c\nIf you leave a Pokémon with me, you’ll be left\nwith only the one.\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full!\c\nMake room, and then come see me again.

Hello there! You must be one of Ilima’s friends?
Come on in! Any friend to my son is a friend\nto me!
Just one thing, though.\c\nI’d like to hear what you think of my boy.\nIs he doing a good job as a captain?
He’s a good captain
I’m not really sure
Sorry. I probably shouldn’t have asked you\nsomething like that out of the blue...\c\nOur Ilima has just always been obsessed with\nPokémon battling, ever since he was a boy.\c\nHe’s like a different person when he\nbattles—you can see it in his eyes!\c\nI’ve always been a little worried about\nwhether he would do all right as a captain.
Sorry to hold you up.\nIf you’re looking for Ilima, he’s in his room.
Any friend of my son’s is welcome here.\nStay as long as you’d like.
Thank you for coming, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
And you’ve arrived with such exquisite timing!\c\nI’ve been conducting research on battle planning\nfor quite some time, and at last my simulation\r\nis complete![VAR 0114(000C)]
Would you be so kind as to test it with\nme, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Not now
Sure
What a shame.\c\nPlease do let me know when you are available.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You have my gratitude.\c\nVery well then. To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(000C)]
Before we begin, allow me to explain...\c\nIt’s not battle results that interest me.\nRather, it’s the carefully-thought-out strategies\r\nor novel tactics employed by Trainers.\c\nHow those plans affect one’s opponent and\ninfluence the outcome of battles—that is where\r\nmy interest lies![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now give me everything you’ve\ngot, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wonderful! What a truly wonderful battle!\c\nI’ll be feeling the aftershocks from that battle\nfor a long time to come. That was the best I\r\ncould’ve hoped for![VAR 0114(000C)]
The way that Ilima looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
Thank you.\c\nAllow me to treat you to some tea and snacks\nback in my room.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Will you be on your way then?\c\nAllow me to offer you this as payment for\nyour assistance.[VAR 0114(000C)]
When a Pokémon holds an Everstone, it will\nnot evolve.\c\nIt has other effects as well, but let’s set those\naside for now.\c\nMay our friendship last as long as an Everstone![VAR 0114(000C)]
I think I’ll begin analyzing our battle data.\c\nThere are so many amazing discoveries yet to\nbe made! Someday I hope to share them\r\nwith everyone![VAR 0114(000C)]

Who are you, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0406)]misterlady?\nAre you one of Sissy’s friends?
It’s a stranger!\nWho are you? Who are you?
Wow!\nAn island challenge amulet!
Sissy isn’t here!\nBut I think she’s coming home, soon.
Play with us till Sissy comes home!
OK
What?
Then I wanna have a battle!\nLet’s do a moldy battle!
Meanie! Big, stinky meanie!\nCome on, play with us!
It’s not a moldy battle!\nIt’s a Multi Battle! We’ll have a Multi Battle!
Yeah, that. So what do you say?\nYou ready, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady?
You’re on!
Not yet
Come on!\nHurry up and get ready already!
Come on!\nYou can’t fight without enough Pokémon!
Wowzers!\nYou are sure strong, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
You might even be stronger than Sissy!
I’m home, girls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sissy!
Welcome home!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou came to visit with us?[VAR 0114(000D)]
M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady was playing with us!
[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe is really strong. Did you know that?
Well, thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nFor entertaining my little sisters so kindly.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, Sissy! Sissy!
Who’s probably stronger? You or this Trainer?\nLike, if you were REALLY trying?
Yeah, who?
Who’s stronger? Are you stronger?
Well... I don’t rightly know.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is definitely strong h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imerself.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But we wanna know who’s stronger!
Battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer!
It looks like I’ve got little choice...\c\nOnce the girls have their minds set, they don’t\nbudge, no matter how hard you try.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come on! Do it!
Battle! Battle!
If you don’t mind, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], could I ask\nyou for a battle?\c\nI’ve spent quite some time devising a way to\ndefeat you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Sure!
Umm...
I know these girls would love to see us battle,\nso please come back anytime to take me on.\c\nAnd perhaps I should warn you...\nI don’t bother with small fries or losing battles.\r\nI plan to haul in a big catch when we fight![VAR 0114(000D)]
All right!
We knew you would do it!
Why don’t we go out front, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nI would have some advantage battling inside\nthe house, since I’m so familiar with the layout.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Go on! Beat h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer, Sissy!
Show h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer what you’ve got!
Shall we?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I have a responsibility to set a good example\nfor my younger sisters, of course.\c\nBut even more important than that...I have my\npride as a captain!\c\nI will show you what a serious Lana can do![VAR 0114(000D)]
I look forward to enjoying a no-holds-barred\nbattle again you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Phew...[VAR 0114(000D)]
No way! She lost!\nSissy actually lost!
That’s amazing!\nM[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady is amazing!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], that was fantastic!\nYou and your Pokémon were perfectly in sync!\c\nIt seems I was still premature in thinking that\nmy full power would be enough to defeat you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The way that Lana looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
How boring! I can’t believe Sissy lost!\nPoo. I’m going home.
Me, too!\nGimme a piggyback ride!
Fine, fine...\nLet’s all be getting back home.\c\nBut I will not be carrying you!\nYou can walk on your own two feet.\r\nWhat else do you think you have feet for?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Thank you again for playing with my sisters.\c\nHere...why don’t you take these?\nYou might want to give them to a Clamperl.[VAR 0114(000D)]
My father is expecting me to help on the boat,\nso I should be going soon.\c\nBut you feel free to stay as long as you want,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. My home is yours.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, strong M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
Hiya, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! What’s up?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I came to play with you!
I’m here for a battle!
All right, let’s do it!\c\nOf course if two Trainers are going to play, it’s\ngotta be a Pokémon battle, right?\c\nYup, it’s decided! I guess we should head to\nLush Jungle.\c\nLet’s make this like a little treasure hunt. Come\nfind me where the Wimpod is! Don’t be late![VAR 0114(000E)]
Mallow! Can you give me a hand?
Huh? Where’s Mallow?
In the jungle
She’s not here
At this hour? That’s not like her...\c\nbut now I’m in a jam. I was going to ask her to\ngo do some shopping for me.
If you see her, can you tell her something\nfor me?\c\nTell her to bring my Wimpod with her when\nshe comes home.
Oh, you made it![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wimpod is in my big brother’s party.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wim!
It’s out here gathering ingredients for\nour restaurant![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wim-wim!
You’ve got all the ingredients you need for a\ndelicious battle, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s do this!
Gimme a minute...
Oh really? Well come back and tell me when\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(000E)]
Time for you to see that I can do more than\njust cook![VAR 0114(000E)]
That battle was a piece of cake for you, wasn’t\nit? I should’ve known—you did clear my trial,\r\nafter all!\c\nAs your captain, I am very proud of you, though![VAR 0114(000E)]
The way that Mallow looked in that battle\nseems to linger in your mind...
There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you ever think about the\nfuture, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I do
Nope
Oh, I see. Well, I’ve got my future all planned out!\c\nI mean, we have to move on from being captains\nwhen we turn 20 anyway.\c\nIt may be ordinary, but I’m hoping to take over\nmy family’s restaurant.\c\nI think I could be an even better chef than my\ndad and big brother one day![VAR 0114(000E)]
Huh? What’s up?\c\nIs it something about my big brother?[VAR 0114(000E)]
He had a favor to ask...
He told me to tell you...
Sorry, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ve gotta get back!\c\nCome on, Wimpod. You, too! Big brother’s\nwaiting for us![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wi-wi-wim!
It’s been fun, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSee you later! Bye![VAR 0114(000E)]

Yah! Hoo! Hee! Hyah![VAR 0114(000F)]
Huhn?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh. It’s you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
What are you doing?
What was that all about?
This is my fire dance training.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This is my torch staff.\c\nWhen I’m actually performing fire dances, I’ll light\nit on fire.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Whenever I have free time, I practice my dance\nas much as I can.\c\nIt takes a lot of repetition to get good at it...just\nlike Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, look at the time![VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry, I know you just got here, but I have to go\nto the Thrifty Megamart.\c\nIf you need to talk to me, come meet me there.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I see...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Kiawe, I’m really terribly sorry about this, but\nI’ve thought long and hard about this decision.\c\nIf it comes down to people who are counting on\nthis job to make a living, and you...
It’s all right.\c\nI know how hard you’ve worked to open this\nlocation after the guardian deity destroyed the\r\nprevious one in anger.\c\nI understand, boss.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Kiawe...\c\nI’ve given you as much as I can afford. Spend\nyour final paycheck wisely.
Thank you very much.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I hope your dream of studying dance abroad\ncomes true someday.\c\nI have to keep working hard here to make my\ndreams for the Thrifty Megamart come true.
It’s OK, boss. You can head back in now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Thank you. I’ll be seeing you.
How could this happen...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, it’s you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
If you don’t mind, I’d like to battle\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course
Just a minute
I see... I’ll be waiting for you here, then.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t feel like dancing by myself right now...[VAR 0114(000F)]
So strong...\c\nI should’ve known. You did clear my trial,\nafter all.\c\nBy the way, did you overhear what we were\njust talking about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
What are you talking about?
Yeah, kind of...
You’re too considerate, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
Yes, of course you did...[VAR 0114(000F)]
My dream is to become a professional\nfire dancer.\c\nI’ve been saving up forever to go study\ndance abroad.\c\nBut I was just laid off from my part-time job. It\nseems like nothing ever goes right...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry.\c\nI didn’t mean to trouble you with my\nproblems, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou’re so easy to talk to, though. I feel much\nbetter after talking with you.\r\nThank you for being there.\c\nI’ll be going then.\nUntil we meet again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000F)]
The way that Kiawe looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...

You little brat![VAR 0114(0017)]
I don’t know what you think you’re doing here,\nbut I actually needed to talk to you.\c\nGet your rear over to the\nHau’oli City Beachfront![VAR 0114(0017)]
So you showed up...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it’s time to battle\nyour boy![VAR 0114(0017)]
Here I come![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wait a minute...[VAR 0114(0017)]
What did you think I asked you to come\nhere for?![VAR 0114(0017)]
This is to make up for when I had to disband\nTeam Skull!\c\nJust so you know, I’ll never change!\c\nWanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
Guzma!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nThis outcome hasn’t changed at all either![VAR 0114(0017)]
Well played, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
You came all the way here just to watch me\nlose, huh? Must be nice to be a lazy old island\r\nkahuna with nothing better to do...[VAR 0114(0017)]
What a high opinion of yourself you have. Ha!\c\nI just happened to see [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here,\nso I thought I would come over.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You wanna get beat down, old man?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh, Guzma...when will you understand?\nOnly when you respect your opponent’s skill\r\nwill it bring out the best in you.\c\nYou miss the true meaning of battling.\nThe goal is not to beat your opponent down,\r\nbut for both Trainers to grow stronger![VAR 0114(0008)]
I don’t care what you say to me, yo.\nBeating people down is all I know![VAR 0114(0017)]
But the battle I just saw seemed a bit different.\c\nWhile you may say you’re only interested in\ncrushing your opponent, I sensed a desire to\r\ndefeat [VAR TRNAME(0000)] deep in your heart.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What do you know, old man?![VAR 0114(0017)]
If you continue on this path, you’ll never be able\nto defeat [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nGuzma, admit the worthiness of your\nopponents! Only then can you become even\r\nstronger than you already are!\c\nAllow yourself to know the people and Pokémon\nyou encounter, and look deeply into your heart.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re still trying to front like you’re my master,\nhuh? I gave up on you a long time ago.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], allow me to handle this foolish\nyoung man.\c\nI will make a fine Trainer out of him yet, or I’m\nnot an island kahuna!\c\nI hope that can be considered penance for the\nwrongs he and Team Skull have committed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Tch![VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh ho ho! The two of us will go many\nplaces together!\c\nAnd we will meet more people and Pokémon who\nwill enrich our lives.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Master...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I ain’t never gonna ask you to forgive me,\nso don’t get it twisted—this is no apology!\c\nBut shut up and take this! I got it for my\nfirst-ever victory so I’d never lose my grip,\r\nand it’s always been like my lucky charm![VAR 0114(0017)]
Who knows what the Alolan winds will bring?\c\nNext time we meet, I’m counting on you to test\nhow strong I’ve gotten.[VAR 0114(0017)]

Would you look at that [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
I think it can still put out a bit more effort!
It’s clearly put out a great deal of effort!\c\nWhy don’t you pin this ribbon on it so that it\nfeels rewarded for all that hard effort?
You received an Effort Ribbon!
You put the Effort Ribbon on [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Now, now, look at that! I’d say that Effort\nRibbon goes perfectly with [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Would you like to show me how much your\nPokémon have grown since joining your team?
Oh? Well, that is too bad...
Which Pokémon will you show me, then?
Ho! This is a hard one...
Hm? It’s rather hard to judge how well you’ve\nraised an Egg, you know.
Oh! It looks like this [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was only...\nLv. [VAR NUM3(0002)] when you first met!\r\nAnd now it’s Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)]!
That is some amazing growth.\nI can feel your deep love for your Pokémon.
That’s some decent growth, all right.\nYou’ve been real decent to it.
That’s no different at all!\c\nI hope you’ll continue your journey so that you\nboth can grow a whole lot together.
How do you grow together?\nBy walking the same path with someone else.\c\nLet me give you this as a reward for showing\nme how far you two have come along together.
You received a Footprint Ribbon!
You put the Footprint Ribbon on\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Your love leaves its marks as surely as your\npassing leaves your footprints upon the sand...\c\nI’m grateful that you were willing to show me\nthe wonderful bond between you and your team.
The path that you’ve walked together with\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] is perfectly easy for me to see,\r\nthanks to that glittering Footprint Ribbon there!
Oh! Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!
I guess maybe you’ll show it some affection\nsoon, huh?
It’s starting to look like it likes you!
You’ve been showing it some affection, huh?\nYou two are looking good!
You two look like great friends!\nYou must play with it a whole lot, huh?
You’ve got to be some of the most affectionate\nfriends I’ve ever seen! I think I’m jealous!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] got a Best Friends Ribbon!
I hope you’ll stay friends forever and ever!\nAnd ever and ever!
You’re the best friends ever, aren’t you!\c\nNo wonder your Pokémon is wearing that\nBest Friends Ribbon!
Ribbons...\c\nThey’re like a way to wrap your Pokémon up in\nprecious memories for perpetuity.\c\nI’ve heard that there are a lot of different kinds\nof ribbons in other regions, outside of Alola.

Hello!\nYou’re a local, aren’t you?\c\nI’ve got a favor I want to ask someone like you!\nPlease, you’ve gotta help me!
All right
Not now
What?! Oh, come on!\nDon’t be so cold! Where’s your Alola spirit?!
Oh, thanks, kid!\nThat’s the Alola spirit! You’re all so nice here!\c\nI’m actually here on my honeymoon, and my\nbeautiful bride has completely fallen for this\r\nPokémon you have here called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Sableye[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nI’ve heard that Sableye get along with Carbink,\nwhich live in Ten Carat Hill.
Could you catch a Sableye for me in Ten\nCarat Hill?\c\nIf you do, I can check out its information in your\n’Dex, and then I can go catch one myself!\c\nI’ll even pay you for your hassle.\nThink of it as a bit of part-time work, OK?
It’s a Pokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Sableye[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nI’ve heard that Sableye get along with Carbink,\nwhich live in Ten Carat Hill.
Oh! You’ve caught a Sableye!\nLet me see your ’Dex for a second!
Mm-hmm... I see...\c\nIts eyes turned into jewels as it ate jewels.\c\nWhat?! Does it mean Sableye eat Carbink?\nHahaha. It can’t be.
All right. Thanks for this, pal!\nNow I’ll go and try to catch one for myself.\c\nHere. It’s not much, but here’s your pay.\nYou’ve earned it!
All right... Now it’s time that I set out to find\na Sableye of my own for my beautiful bride!
Hey, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nDo me a favor.
Sure
Not now
Hey! You’re too much in a hurry!
Well, I’m pretty relaxed and laid-back.\c\nA bit too relaxed, actually... I may be wasting\nmy life...\c\nSo I want to learn a more speedy way of life\nfrom a Pokémon.
I’ve heard that there is a Pokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Abra\n[VAR COLOR(0000)]in the tall grass in Hau’oli City.\c\nWill you catch one for me and register it in\nyour Pokédex?\c\nI’ve heard that it’s so speedy that it runs away\ninstantly, though.\c\nIf you keep your word and find one for me, then\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble, OK?
What I want is a Pokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Abra[VAR COLOR(0000)] from the\ntall grass in Hau’oli City!\c\nOne way to catch a Pokémon that is quick to\nflee may be throwing a Poké Ball right away.
You’ve caught that Abra?\nWell then, show me your Pokédex!
It sleeps 18 hours a day?!\nAnd it’ll teleport itself while sleeping?!\c\nOh, no. This won’t work. Life is short.\nSleeping most of the time is such a waste.
But...it would be nice to be able to move fast\nwhile relaxing and sleeping.\c\nSo here is your pay for the work you did.
I’ll enjoy my life to the fullest while relaxing!
Hey, have you got a moment?\nYou live here in Alola, right?\c\nI’ve got a favor I’d like to ask. Do you mind?
No problem
Not now
Oh... Sorry, then.
Wow, thank you! I’m so glad that you would\nlisten to a request from a total stranger like me.\c\nI’m actually here in Alola with my darling hubby.\nIt’s our honeymoon!\c\nWhen we were looking for Berries, we saw this\nPokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Crabrawler[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nMy darling hubby fell in love at first sight\nwith Crabrawler...
Anyway, I wanted to ask if you could catch\none of those Crabrawler for me.\c\nIf I know what kind of Pokémon it is, then I can\nprobably go and catch one myself.\c\nYou may be able to find Crabrawler in a pile of\nfallen Berries.\c\nIf you catch one and come back to show me its\nPokédex entry, I can pay you for your trouble!
I heard that [VAR COLOR(0001)]Crabrawler[VAR COLOR(0000)] love Berries and\ngather under trees.
What? You’ve caught Crabrawler?\nThen would you mind showing me your ’Dex?
They fight over their favorite Berries and punch\neach other... I see...
Actually, I want to get one of these Crabrawler\nfor myself now!\c\nLet me at least pay you like I promised first.\nThis is a little token of my appreciation.
Thank you, young Trainer!\nI’ll go look for some Crabrawler at once!
You there!\nI have a favor to ask you...
Sure
Not now
Oh, well. OK!
Seriously?\nWoo-hoo! Thanks!\c\nActually, I’m a fashion designer, and there is a\nPokémon that I want to get inspiration from\r\nfor my new collection.
The contrast between the black and pink...\nIt’s so seriously cool...\c\nThat’s why I want you to catch a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Salazzle[VAR COLOR(0000)] and\nregister it in your Pokédex!\c\nOf course, I’ll give you tons of money!\nI’m counting on you!
Come to think of it, I’ve never seen\nmale [VAR COLOR(0001)]Salazzle[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\c\nYou can find both male and female Salandit in\nWela Volcano Park, though.
You’ve caught a Salazzle?!\nLet me see it! Hand over that Pokédex!
Hah... It punishes Salandit that fail to gather\nfood by slapping them!\c\nI like it. Its strength and harshness...\nSalazzle is the inspiration my design needed!
Thanks!\nThis is for you as I promised.
Thanks to you, more and more ideas are pouring\nout of me! My new collection will be awesome!
Um...excuse me, but...could I ask you something?
Sure
Not now
Oh, I see...\nSorry to bother you then...
Thank you for giving me some of your time.\c\nI’m currently researching a Pokémon called\n[VAR COLOR(0001)]Corsola[VAR COLOR(0000)], but I’m terrible at fishing, and so\r\nI’m not making any progress at all...
Do you think I could offer you a bit of part-time\nwork as a research assistant?\c\nCould you try to catch a Corsola for me?\c\nIf you manage to catch one, please come and\nshow me your Pokédex data. I have enough\r\nin the budget to pay you, so please!
I need to see a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Corsola[VAR COLOR(0000)].\nPlease...help me out...
You’ve caught the Corsola?\nThen will you show me your Pokédex?
So there it is...\c\nCorsola’s coral branches are short because\nMareanie attack Corsola...\c\nI’m relieved that it doesn’t cause any pain to\nCorsola, but, wow...nature is harsh!
Thank you. You’ve been a great help!\nHere. For your assistance.
You’ve been a great help with my research.\nNow I should be able to make some progress!
Why, hello, Trainer.\nLooks like you’ve got a Pokédex on you.\c\nHow would you like to do a little part-time work\non behalf of the Aether Foundation?
Sure
Not now
Well, that is a shame.\nCome back if you ever have the time.
We at the Aether Foundation work to protect\nPokémon through conservation.\c\nRight now, we are surveying the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Goomy [VAR COLOR(0000)]that\nlive in Lush Jungle.\c\nThe foundation is collecting its own data, of\ncourse, but we would also like to know what\r\ndata the Pokédex records about them.
So your job, if you should choose to accept it,\nwould be to register Goomy in your Pokédex\r\nand then show us the data.\c\nWe will pay you for the work, of course.\nI hope you’ll help us out.
Please show us the data that your Pokédex\nrecords about the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Goomy[VAR COLOR(0000)] living in Lush Jungle.\c\nThey seem to appear during SOS battles...and\nwon’t appear unless it’s raining...
You’ve caught a Goomy?\nThen would you show me your Pokédex?
I see... Because most of the body is water, it\nappears only during the rain so that it won’t\r\ndry out.\c\nThe biology of this Goomy is one that we hadn’t\nyet uncovered in our own research...\c\nThis is just the level of detail that I knew we\ncould expect from the Pokédex!
Thank you very much!\nHere is your pay.
Thank you for helping us with our research.\c\nI think we’ll have an even better understanding\nof Goomy thanks to this.
Whooooa! You have a Rotom Dex!\c\nI have a perfect job for you!\nPlease help me!
Sure
Not now
Wha-a-at?!\nOh, well...too bad...
I’m an employee of the Aether Foundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR COLOR(0001)]Natu[VAR COLOR(0000)], but I’ve had no luck finding any\r\nof them, and I’m in a real tough spot now...
If you happen to catch a Natu, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
[VAR COLOR(0001)]Natu[VAR COLOR(0000)] live in the Akala Outskirts.\c\nAccording to reports, they are often seen in\nthe morning.
You caught a Natu?\nThen I’ll have a look at your ’Dex.
So, that’s it... They can’t fly, but they can jump\nreally high...\c\nThere must be a reason why they appear only\nin the morning, too.\c\nI guess there are things that we can’t learn\nfrom the Aether Foundation’s data alone...
I appreciate your cooperation.\nHere, this is for you!
Thanks to you, we’ll know more about the\nbiology of Natu.\c\nI truly appreciate your cooperation with the\nAether Foundation!
Whooooa! You have a Rotom Dex!\c\nI have a perfect job for you!\nPlease help me!
Sure
Not now
Wha-a-at?!\nOh, well...too bad...
I’m an employee of the Aether Foundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR COLOR(0001)]Hoothoot[VAR COLOR(0000)], but I’ve had no luck finding\r\nany of them, and I’m in a real tough spot now...
If you happen to catch a Hoothoot, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
[VAR COLOR(0001)]Hoothoot[VAR COLOR(0000)] live in Lush Jungle.\c\nAccording to reports, they are seen often\nduring the night.
You caught a Hoothoot?\nThen I’ll have a look at your ’Dex.
So, that’s it... People in ancient times used\nHoothoot as a clock.\c\nThere must be a reason why they appear only\nduring the night, too.\c\nI guess there are things that we can’t learn\nfrom the Aether Foundation’s data...
Thanks for your research! Here, this is for you!
Thanks to you, we’ll know more about the\nbiology of Hoothoot.\c\nI truly appreciate your cooperation with the\nAether Foundation!
Um, could I borrow a moment of your time?\nJust a moment, mind you.
Sure
Not now
O-oh... Of course. You’re busy.\nHow silly of me to try talking to you...
Th-thank you very much.\c\nYou see...I’ve fallen in love at first sight!\nWith a Pokémon called [VAR COLOR(0001)]Minior[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nI love it to bits... I love it so much that I can’t\nbear to even catch one for myself!\c\nSo I wanted to ask a favor...\nCould you catch a Minior for me and then\r\nshow me its Pokédex entry so I can see it?
I think you’ll find some adorable Minior\naround the observatory.\c\nThey look like meteorites, so I’m sure you’ll know\nas soon as you see one.
Of course, I’ll pay you for your trouble.\nPlease find an adorable [VAR COLOR(0001)]Minior[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
What?! You actually caught a Minior?!\nThe Pokédex! Give it here! At once!
Oooh... My little Minior...\nHow adorable you are...\c\nThe beautiful core wrapped in that hard shell...\nIt’s so very dreamy...
Oh! This is the best! Just wonderful!\nHere is your payment, as promised!
I got to know my beloved Minior even better\nthan before!\c\nThank you for this! Have a wonderful journey!
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right?\nWanna do a little job for me?
Sure
Not now
Hmph. Fine then.\nIf you change your mind, though, come see me.
I’m looking for information about a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR COLOR(0001)]Garchomp[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nSo I want you to catch a Garchomp and show\nme the data that your Pokédex records for it.
People say they saw it in Haina Desert, but\nI haven’t been able to find it.\c\nSo go find one for me. If you do a good job,\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble.
My coworker told me that Gabite sometimes\ngets called into battles as an ally when there\r\nis a sandstorm raging...\c\nBut why just Gabite?\nWhat I want is a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Garchomp[VAR COLOR(0000)].
Caught a Garchomp?\nThat’s awesome! Show me your ’Dex!
...I knew it! Just trying to find it wouldn’t work!\c\nYou have to evolve a Gabite that appeared in an\nSOS battle into a Garchomp...\c\nI’m so glad that I asked you for help!\nThis is my job, but to be honest, it’s hard.\c\nI’ll copy the data in your ’Dex and report it\nto my boss...
Thanks a bunch, pal.\nNow I won’t get chewed out by my boss.\c\nTake your payment. No need to be shy about it.
I joined the Aether Foundation ’cause I thought\nthe white uniforms were really cool looking, but...\c\nPokémon conservation and all is actually a lot\nmore hard work than I expected... I sometimes\r\neven get bitten by Pokémon...\r\nIt’s no good just following a whim, you know?

Thank you, [VAR PKNAME(0001)]...\nAnd do not worry.\c\nThose star pulses that you bestowed upon me\n30 years ago have all been made safe.\r\nI entrusted them to a group of wonderful men.
Thank you, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady...\c\nI think I can go home now...\nThanks to the power of your [VAR PKNAME(0001)].
Back to space!
Here... This is my thanks.\c\nI hope you will take it, without holding back,\ntogether with my thoughts and wishes.
I will never forget...the people of this world.
And now...I think I’ll see myself out.
Fare thee well!
Hm...?\c\n... ... ...
That Pokémon you journey with...\nIt is Sol...\r\nSolgaleo?
That Pokémon you journey with...\nIt is Luna...\r\nLunala?
No... That’s not it...\nIt’s all wrong...
Where is it?\nThe Pokémon that always protected me?\r\nThat round body... That rugged form...\r\nThose sharp, burning eyes...
Where is it?\nThe Pokémon that always held me close?\r\nThat curved body... That perfect arc...\r\nComing to the most exquisite points...
If only I could see it once more...\nI think...I might remember something...

Aerodactyl is a fast Pokémon. I wonder how\nyou’ll use its speed in battle.
Your party and your Boxes are full?! I can really\nfeel your love for Pokémon!
Well, if you do decide you’d like to battle\nalongside Aerodactyl, come let me know!

Want me to sell you this Dusk Stone?\nIt’s yours for just $[VAR NUM4(0000,002C)]!
Sigh...\nDoesn’t anyone want this thing?
What?! You can’t even carry it!\nI can’t sell you it if you can’t take it from me!
But you don’t even have that much!\nAnd I’m not lowering the price, either.
Here you go! Your very own Shiny Stone!
There are Pokémon that can evolve if you use\nthat on them, but I don’t know which. See ya!
Here you go! Your very own Dusk Stone!
There are Pokémon that can evolve if you use\nthat on them, but I don’t know which. See ya!

I’ve been waiting for you!\c\nNow let me explain about the Reassembly Unit.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Have you been collecting Zygarde’s Cells\nand Cores?[VAR 0114(0026)]
You’ve collected fewer than 10 Cells\nand Cores combined...[VAR 0114(0027)]
You’ve collected 10 or more Cells\nand Cores combined.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Anyway, I’ll explain![VAR 0114(0026)]
The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with the Pokémon Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Assembly is...to create a Pokémon\ncalled Zygarde!\c\nNow, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
To separate Zygarde...\nit means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...then why is it in Alola...?\c\nIs it a sign that something is about to happen?[VAR 0114(0027)]
If you collect Zygarde’s Cells and Cores, you\nmay get the answer. Anyhow...\c\nwe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

Welcome to the Trainers’ School!\nI’m the principal.
What an honor for me and the school!\c\nTo think that our teachings would not only give\nrise to a captain but to a League Champion!
Despite your lofty accomplishments, though, I’d\nhazard that you still don’t know everything that\r\nthe Trainer School has to teach you, eh?\c\nThen allow me to give you a special, expert\nlesson from the principal herself!
Just as the saying goes, even the fool may\ngive the wise man good counsel if he listens.\c\nI may have lost, but heed my advice and use\nthis. It is one of my favorite items.
If your Pokémon is holding the King’s Rock, its\nattacks may make an opponent flinch.\c\nAnd that’s the end of what I can teach you.\nI’m glad I was able to meet you here.
If I can defeat h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer, then that will mean that our\nschool’s principal is stronger than a Champion.\c\nAnd even if I lose, we can still boast that we’re\nthe school who helped create a Champion.\c\nOh, it’s too good!

Oh ho ho ho!\nOh ho ho ho!
I am the buffet queen!\c\nThe empress ruling over all worldly buffets...
I have made my way through life\ndevouring all goodies in my path![VAR 0114(002D)]
I happened to see you eating the other day.[VAR 0114(002D)]
The way you eat is so cute and exciting!\nStay just the way you are! You’re fabulous![VAR 0114(002D)]
I mean... What I’m trying to say is...\nI think you’re just so lovely![VAR 0114(002D)]
I was hoping we could have a battle just once.[VAR 0114(002D)]
What do you say? Wouldn’t you like to see\nwhich of us is fit to be boss of the buffet? [VAR 0114(002D)]
All right, bring it on then!\nLet’s go grab a seat, shall we?[VAR 0114(002D)]
We’ll have 10 turns.\c\nGrab as many delicious goodies\nas you can in the allotted time.\r\nWhoever walks away with the fullest belly wins![VAR 0114(002D)]
Well then, let’s get this buffet battle started![VAR 0114(002D)]
What, are you too busy?\nFine. We don’t have to battle.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Come back when you feel like battling! If you\nkeep me waiting too long, I might lose interest![VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh, you came by to see me again!\nHow about it? Wanna battle me?[VAR 0114(002D)]
[~ 66]
[~ 67]
[~ 68]
Time’s up! The buffet is finished![VAR 0114(002D)]
OK, time to see who walked away from the\nbuffet more satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
My level of satisfaction is...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Mmmm! Delish! I’m pretty satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
How satisfied are you?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hmmm...\nAs far as I can tell...[VAR 0114(002D)]
You look like someone who’s totally\nsatisfied by your belly full of delicious goodies![VAR 0114(002D)]
You look pretty full! You must be satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
What a stern look! Looks like you didn’t get\nenough to eat![VAR 0114(002D)]
You look terribly disappointed!\nLooks like your body and mind are still hungry![VAR 0114(002D)]
Well, the results are in! Looks like...[VAR 0114(002D)]
I’m the big winner! Oh ho ho ho![VAR 0114(002D)]
It’s a tie...I guess. That’s pretty cool...I suppose![VAR 0114(002D)]
Come back whenever you feel like battling!\nI’ll be ready and waiting for you![VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ll always be happy to take you on whenever\nyou like![VAR 0114(002D)]
[~ 84]
You won! No way! Ooh, I’m so mad![VAR 0114(002D)]
Thanks, though. That’s the first taste I’ve ever\nhad of defeat.\r\nKinda bitter, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Heehee. Way to go!\c\nI knew you could do it when I first laid eyes\non you![VAR 0114(002D)]
I have to give the title of buffet queen to\nyou now![VAR 0114(002D)]
From now on, you’re the new buffet queen![VAR 0114(002D)]
From now on, you’re the new buffet queen...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh, wait, no. You’re a boy, so you’ll be the\nbuffet king![VAR 0114(002D)]
Keep eating lots of delicious goodies\nso you can grow big and strong![VAR 0114(002D)]
Good-bye then. I hope we can meet\nagain someday.[VAR 0114(002D)]
What’s that? What am I going to do now?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hehe. There’s a whole world of delicious\ngoodies out there you know nothing about!\r\nI’m gonna go eat ’em all up![VAR 0114(002D)]
Hmmph![VAR 0114(002D)]
To eat or not to eat?\nHmmm...\c\nAllow me to consult my stomach.
After consulting with my stomach,\nit seems that we’re fated to battle!
[~ 99]
What should I eat next?\nLet me know, stomach...
The food of commoners always looks so quaint.\c\nWo-wonderful!
You seem to have your eye on it, so it must be\ngood commoner food.\c\nI’ll be taking my share—all of it!
[~ 103]
What a quaint idea this “buffet” system is!\nI do enjoy being around you commoners!
*slurp*
Heh. Looks tasty, doesn’t it? That’s because I\nmade it all!\c\nI take the responsibility of tasting everything\nvery seriously!
[~ 107]
I became a Cook because I love food, but all I do\nis cook, not eat! It’s really frustrating...
What sort of cuisine do they serve here?
Ooh, so before we partake of the main course,\nwe can start off with an appetizer of a\r\nPokémon battle!
[~ 111]
There are many kinds of cuisine in the world.
Hi-yah! I need all the nutrients I can get\nbefore I head to the mountains for my training!
You have to fight if you want to eat! In other\nwords, welcome to the Battle Buffet!
[~ 115]
The sadness of being unable to eat what I want\nis intense. If I can get over it, I’ll become\r\neven stronger!
Strong Trainers gather to eat popular dishes...\nThis is going to take some skills!
I’m normally just a Pokémon Breeder!\c\nHere at the buffet I become a warrior loyal only\nto my appetite!
[~ 119]
I’m the type who gets all excited when\nI’m hungry.
Eating is truly the greatest pleasure we have\nin life! You’ll understand when you get older.
I feel like if I can just eat this delicious food,\nmy meeting will go better!
[~ 123]
Ah, who cares about my boss?\c\nIf I don’t get something good to eat,\nI don’t think I can take it anymore!
Don’t worry about me. I’m just looking.\nNo, really, I’m just looking.
Hang on a second! I can’t help it!\nI do want to eat after all!
[~ 127]
What do you think of girls who eat a lot?
Only the strong can eat! Muwuhahaha!\nSounds like my kind of place!
Your food is my food now!\nAnd I’m about to devour my food!
[~ 131]
No food for the weak...\nAnd I thought this was my kind of place...
I’m gonna fill up on some tasty food.\nIt might be tough...
What do you think you’re doing?!\c\nI saw it first! You think I’m\ngonna just let you take it?!
[~ 135]
They always have plenty of\ndishes no one likes left over...
I’m no Youngster!\nI’m a starving monster!
My favorite things, huh? That’s easy!\nTasty treats and Pokémon battles!
[~ 139]
I guess Youngsters can’t\nactually become monsters...
The law of the jungle is the only rule here\nat the Battle Buffet!
Hey, stop that! That’s mine!\nI told you, it’s the law of the jungle!
[~ 143]
I thought it had something\nto do with a jungle gym...
For this amount of food...\nand these ingredients...\c\nLet me see...\nAccording to my calculations...
OK! This dish will be indispensable\nif I want to get my money’s worth!
[~ 147]
What a fool I was...\nCalories had nothing to do with it...
I like this tense atmosphere.\c\nTo eat is to live, so everyone here is so serious.
Hey, if you can beat me,\ndo you want me to feed you?
[~ 151]
Open up, here it comes!
I can keep going.\nI can still eat more...\c\nI’ve got to eat a ton to make this worth it!
Whether you get to eat or not,\nit’s $1,200!\c\nIf that’s the case, I’ve got no choice but to eat!
[~ 155]
Your Pokémon and your appetite sure\nare healthy!
Dine here

Come back later
I’ll have some!

Hello, darling...\c\nI brought you some flowers today.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
...What do you think, darling?\nThey are lovely, aren’t they?
Hyah! Hiii-yah!\nHyah! Hyah!
Shhh, quiet now.\c\nThere are many others resting in these plots.
Hiii-yah! Hyah hyah hyah!
Come now, dry those tears.\nWe’re all done with tears, aren’t we? You and I.\c\nIf we come here, we can see him again any\ntime that we want to.\c\nAnd as long as we don’t forget him, he will\nalways be with us...
Hyah...
Hyah?!
Oh! Hello, young Trainer.\nI’m sorry for all of this one’s noise.
Hyah!
This is my husband’s grave.\nAnd this silly one here was his Pokémon.
Hyah! Hyah! Hiiii-yah!
It was...an accident.\c\nBut my husband sent Machamp back into its\nball at the moment of the crash.\r\nIt was a miracle that Machamp survived.\r\nBut my husband...\c\nWell, ever since the accident, Machamp here\nhas hated being inside a Poké Ball.\r\nIn fact it flung its own ball off somewhere.
Hi-yaaaaaahhh!
Of course I was devastated when my husband\npassed away.\c\nAnd there were times when I hated that other\nman, who caused the accident.\c\nBut that man...\nHe had a family, too. A young wife.\c\nWhen I saw her face, I just couldn’t go on hating\nanyone for what happened.
Oh, I’m sorry...\nI didn’t mean to say all that...
Thank you for letting an old woman ramble so.\c\nThis belonged to my husband, but I’d be happy\nif you could use it.
Do you also use Ride Pokémon to get around?\c\nIt is fun and quite convenient, but please do\nbe careful not to get in any accidents.\c\nTake care, young Trainer.
Good night for today, darling...\nWe’ll come visit again tomorrow night.

Then I’ll update your PC Boxes for you.\c\nWith this, you can get your Pokémon judged\nanytime that you’ve got access to a PC!

Are you out and about on your island challenge?\nWhen you’ve completed it, come on back.\r\nDon’t forget about me here, OK?
That [VAR PKNAME(0000)] of yours...\nI don’t know why, but it sure takes me back!
You know Mankey, right?\nI’m actually the one who came up with it!\c\nThe boss told me to make a Pokémon with a bit\nof this and a bit of that, and that’s what I drew!\c\nI’m pretty fond of it myself!
You know, I thought up the Pokémon moves\nmyself and programmed ’em in myself, too.\c\nSo I never really wrote down the details or\nanything. Sorry about that...
We had a poll in the company once a long time\nago to see which Pokémon was most popular...\c\nand back then the winner was Exeggutor!
Tauros used to be real strong, huh?\c\nI was the one who thought up that one.\nBut Blizzard was a bit too strong, eh?
You know Diglett, right?\c\nIt’s actually basically just a character that I\nhad made up when I was a little kid.\r\nI even drew up a flip-book featuring it then!
You know Mew, right?\c\nI made it. Everything about it. The pixel art,\nits cry, its Pokédex entry, everything.\c\nI just barely finished in time, too! It was right at\nthe very end of the game’s development!
Can I tell you a little something, just between\nyou and me?\c\nSee, the Japanese version of Pokémon Blue was\nan exclusive release when it first came out.\r\nOnly certain people could get it.\c\nFrom what I heard, that was a real pain for the\npeople working in the shops that sold it...
We were all young folks in the office back when\nwe first made Pokémon Blue to be sold in Japan.\c\nNow we’re all a bunch of middle-aged coots.
Back in the day, the programming used up all\nthe space on a cartridge, so if we wanted to\r\nadd something new, we had to clean it up first...\c\nFirst we’d find enough space, then we could\nmake what we wanted... It was a pain!
In that one game, you could talk to the Pokémon\nfollowing you to find out how it was doing.\r\nI was the one who came up with that idea!
I heard something from Masuda one time...\c\nApparently the sound that plays when you save\nis different in each version...\c\nI gotta tell you...I can’t tell any difference at all!
Just between you and me, but...\c\nWhen we were working on these new titles once,\nI got told to come up with version differences...\r\nBoy, I was gobsmacked!\c\nBut in the end, I’m glad I helped make them.
You know Shuckle, right?\nI was the one who thought it up.\c\nBet you were surprised to find out that giving a\nShuckle a Berry to hold in Gold and Silver would\r\nturn it into a Berry Juice after battling!
You know Piloswine?\nI designed that Pokémon.\c\nI felt like I had to get all 12 animals in\nthe Chinese zodiac together, you know?
The Time Capsule was pretty awesome, right?\c\nBoy, it still sounds like a dream...\nTo be able to go back and forth in time, popping\r\nback to the past or into the future as you’d like!\c\nBut making it work was a real pain.
I loved the Bug-Catching Contest!\c\nDid you know that you can win it even by\ncatching a Caterpie or Metapod? It’s true!
Boy, when we were told halfway through\ndevelopment to make Kanto, too...\r\nI thought I might just expire on the spot!\c\nBut I’m glad we made it that way.
When we were having trouble fitting all the data\nin for Gold and Silver, and we were really in a\r\npinch, this amazing guy came along and made\r\na program for us that solved all our problems.\c\nHe went on to become the amazing president\nof a real big company soon after that, too.
Your lead Pokémon’s Nature is [VAR ITEM1(0001)].\nThat means its Attack stat will grow easily.\c\nMy explanation could grow pretty easily, too,\nbut I’ll keep it short and sweet for you.

I’d say I’m pretty up to speed on Pokémon\nbattling. And the director...\r\nWell, he’s not as good as me, but he’s not bad.\c\nSo what do you think?\nWant to take us both on in a Pokémon battle?
Let’s battle
Let’s not
But you don’t have two Pokémon that can fight!
Good.\nThen let’s do this!
Hey, Iwao!
Yup, I’m here! What did you...\nHuh?! A battle?!\r\nAll right! Then I’ll be aiming for victory!
Oh yeah? Well, that’s a real shame.\nI’m really good, after all.
You’re really good, too.\nI really thought we might whip you, but...\r\nWell, you sure got us in the end!
Very good! Really!\nYou’ve raised some great Pokémon!\r\nLet me heal them up for you.
We’ll fight you again sometime, if you want.\nJust once a day, though, OK?\c\nSo come back tomorrow.\nThough I’ll probably have forgotten you already.
We’re not gonna fight you again today.\nYou’ve got to come back tomorrow.
Oh, you’re a player!\nWe’ve been making games here.\r\nWhat color would you choose?
Red
Green
Blue
Yellow
Red, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who stays\r\ntrue to your heart and says what you want.
Green, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re pretty dedicated to our game,\r\nthen. Are you a fanatic, maybe?
Blue, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who does what\r\nyou want, even if it’s not the popular thing.
Pi! Pikachu!\nPika pika chu!
And look at you!\nThat [VAR PKNAME(0000)] you’ve got with you...\r\nThat tells me you like to delve into history and\r\nthink about how things come to be.\c\nI’ve got a set of Poké Balls to give to a Trainer\nlike you!
You received a set of Poké Balls that have been\ncrafted from Apricorns!
Go on, and catch your favorite Pokémon in\nthe balls you like best!
Clefairy is the cutest, isn’t it?\nOooh, I just want to hug it and squeeze it!
Ciao!\c\nYou know, I just love getting to meet so many\nTrainers no matter where I go in the world!
Getting to have everyone play the game that\nI helped make... It’s a dream come true!
Everybody here at GAME FREAK loves sweets!\c\nIf you leave candy or anything sitting around,\nit will be gone in no time...\c\nHere, I’ll share a sweet drink with you, too.\nTake it from me!
[~ 54]
Have fun on your adventure with your Pokémon!
And here. I’ll give you this, too.\c\nWith one of these, the Pokémon you drop off at\nthe Pokémon Nursery will have a better chance\r\nthan usual of finding a Pokémon Egg.

It was always one of his favorite TMs.\c\nHe won so many trophies when he entered\nbattle competitions with the Pokémon that\r\nhe’d taught to use Swagger.

Eggcellent!\nSince you’re here, let me show you something!
Shiny Exeggcute!\nGolden, shining Exeggcute!\r\nAll six of them glitter so eggcellently!
I’d love to share one with you, but even though\nthey look like six Exeggcute, they are just one!\c\nBut if I can’t give you one of my shiny gold\nExeggcute, these should be close enough!
I’ve heard that Exeggcute in Alola evolve with\nsome kind of stone.\c\nBut I’m afraid that Nuggets don’t ever evolve\ninto Big Nuggets, no matter what you do...

...Ora?
It is holding something out to you...\nWill you take it?
Take it
Leave it
There you are!
...Mmm.
This fellow here’s my partner, Gru the Oranguru.\c\nBut he just hasn’t really taken a liking to me.\nMaybe he hasn’t known me long enough yet.\c\nHe often gets out on his own like this.\nI don’t know, maybe he feels stressed?
Mmph.
Did he maybe give you something?
Let me remind you that lying to an officer is an\noffense! I could have you up on charges!\c\nSo let me ask you one more time...
Ohhh, Gru...!\nThat was locked up in our safe!\c\nOranguru are clever Pokémon, so I’m sure Gru\nhere had no problem getting the safe open.
Mmm.
Sigh... Fine.\c\nYou take it then.\nUse it however you’d like.
Mmm.
I guess Gru must’ve gotten this nasty habit of\nlifting things from his old Trainer.\r\nSmart as a whip, but real sticky fingers.\c\nIt makes him a handful to control, but it’s not\nlike I can just ignore him till his old Trainer\r\ngets out of jail and comes back for him, right?\c\nSorry for complaining to you about my problems.\nHere, take this and be on your way.
And don’t feel like you’ve got to pay me back in\nkind for that Return.\c\nFavors don’t always need returning.\nThat’s not why I’m doing any of this.\c\nI just hope this fellow here can straighten out\nbefore his old Trainer gets back.
...Mmph.

I came all the way from this faraway region\ncalled Johto to visit Alola.\r\nIs it true you can’t use Fly to fly around here?
I don’t know. Is it?
Yes, it is
Seems like! I got told off for trying it!\nThey said it was some kind of law or something!\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
Wow... So it’s really a thing?\nThis really is a whole different region.\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
On Charizard
With a Ride Pager
Wow... So everyone just rides around on special\nCharizard that’ve been raised for the job?\c\nSounds weird, if you ask me, but I’ve gotta admit\nthat riding on a Charizard would be a blast!
Ho, so that’s how it works, huh?\nSpecial gear that can call Pokémon?\c\nI’d heard that Alola had a great transportation\nsystem, but it’s really true, huh?
Thanks for teaching me about how things are\nhere in Alola.\c\nHere, I’ll give you this lovely TM for your help!
Back where I’m from, in Johto, this kind of TM\nis a real big deal.\c\nThey’re called Hidden Machines, or HMs,\nbecause they’re so hard to get your hands on.\c\nBut here I guess it’s just another TM.\nMaybe you can use it in battle or something!
The way people live can be different depending\non where they live.\c\nThe value of things also depends on where you\nhappen to be.\c\nOne of the best things about traveling is getting\nto feel and understand that up close.

Hiii there. ♪ Yes, you. ♪\nWe’re the Hidden Maidens! ♪
See we’re, like, here in Alola for a shoot. ♪
But we’re taking all the shots ourselves. ♪\nWe don’t have a cameraman. ♪
We don’t have an agent or anyone to help us,\nbut we’re going to be big someday, soon. ♪
That’s why we need your help, stranger. ♪\nWe need shots for our PV.\c\nA promotional video for our work. ♪
We were thinking, like, maybe a Multi Battle. ♪\c\nThere’d be this big, bad Trainer who is so, so\nmean to the poor Hidden Maidens... ♪\c\nAnd we’d be all cute and, like, “Oh no!” ♪
So could you take us on in a Multi Battle? ♪
No way
Sure
Awww...\nIf you ever come around, we’ll be here. ♪\c\nAnd of course we’ll give you a reward if you\ncan help us get some, like, savage shots. ♪
Yaaas! ♪ I, like, totally love you right now. ♪\nLet’s do it. ♪
Um, you do know that there’s, like, a certain\nnumber of Pokémon you need for Multi Battles?
OK, Scene 1...\c\nThe Hidden Maidens run into some trouble at\nthe beach! ♪\c\nAnd...action! ♪
That’s a cut! ♪\nThat was so savage!
We’re going to have the best photos. ♪\nWe really owe you this time. ♪
Here. Take these as your, like, reward. ♪\nUse them every day and think of us,\r\nthe HMs! ♪
We call these Hidden Machines where we’re\nfrom, get it? ♪
Truth is we’ve got our own hidden sides, yeah?\c\nMaybe we’re, like, high key stars, but we’re\nlow key HM makers.\c\nNo, seriously, we make Hidden Machines.
Yeah, we’re like national treasures back in the\nKalos region because of our HM skills. ♪\c\nBut there’s no money to be made in making HMs.\nYou can’t even sell them!
But we heard that people don’t need HMs\nhere in Alola, so we figured...\c\nLike, maybe we could sell them here as regular\nold TMs, right?
And we thought we could sell tons of them if we\nmarket them ourselves, since we’re so cute! ♪
Surf and Waterfall are both super strong TMs!\c\nYou should, like, at least try teaching them\nto one of your Water Pokémon pals.

There is something written on his chest...\c\n“I’m just a poor Hypno.\nShare some love.”\c\nThe eerie Hypno keeps on staring at you...
Ignore him
Give him $1
Give him $100
Give him $1,000
Bah!
Hmph!
Zzz.
Wowzers!\nYou’re really giving me this?!
It looked like a Hypno, but it’s actually just a\nperson wearing a Pokémon costume...
Look at you, big spender!\nI figured someone might give me money if only I\r\npretended to be a Pokémon, but I had no luck...\r\nuntil now, that is!\c\nYou’re the first big donor I’ve had!\nA shining example of humanity!\c\nI’m so touched that I’ve got to do something\nto pay you back for this. Here, take this!
Rest seems like a good move for a Hypno, right?\c\nI won’t give you back your money, of course,\nbut I’d be happy to let you have that!
Now, I guess I’d better get back to work!\c\nI can’t get anything if my cover is blown, so\ndon’t you talk to me no more either!

I heard that other regions have these “Pokémon\nDay Care” places...\c\nApparently you can leave Pokémon there, and\nthey’ll raise your Pokémon for you.
We’ve got nurseries here in Alola, but all we\ndo is hold on to your Pokémon for you.\c\nWe don’t help them get stronger or learn any\nmoves, but I’d guess we’re easier on your wallet!
Oh, and there is something else!\nIf you leave two Pokémon together at the\r\nnursery, you sometimes end up finding an Egg!\c\nSince we’re talking about it, do you want one of\nthe Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
Thanks for taking it off my hands!\c\nAnd don’t go trying to crack it just because you\ncan’t wait to see what’s inside!\c\nThough I’ve never heard of a Pokémon Egg\ncracking except when it’s ready to hatch.
Oh, yeah? Well, I’ll hold on to it for now, but if\nyou change your mind, this Egg can be yours!
Do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the\nnursery recently?
If you carry a Pokémon Egg around with you,\nit will hatch into a Pokémon.\c\nI bet it must feel pretty happy being surrounded\nby your team, even before it’s born.
Whoa! You can’t even take an Egg?!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?!\c\nI guess I’ll hold on to it for now, but it’s yours\nif you ever want it.

Would you just look at those biceps!\nThey’re bulging with strength!\r\nThey’re practically big enough to burst!
Can you even imagine how far you’d be able\nto drive a golf ball with muscles like those?!
Mah...
The Machamp seems uncomfortable...\c\nShould you stop them?\nYou’ll probably get dragged into a battle...
Stop them
Let them be
Uh, excuse you?\nWhat do you think you’re doing?\c\nWe hired this big fella to be our caddy.\c\nAnd we’re in the middle of something important\nright now, so how about you get out of my grill?
Yeah, just get lost, would you?
Are you even serious about this?\nYou’ve only got one Pokémon that can fight!\c\nThere’s no point in even battling someone like\nyou!
What is up with you...
I know, right? Just totally killed the mood.\nLet’s just go...
Geez, you little...\c\nWhat was that, huh?\nYou trying to be a hero or something?\c\nWhat’d you go and do that for, huh?\c\nI’m not a Pokémon...\nI’m a born-and-bred human being, duh!\c\nThis is just a costume!
Like, seriously, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0404)]dudelady...\nAre you just here to ruin my day?\c\nGoing and blowing all the hard work that I put\ninto disguising myself as a Machamp caddy...\c\nI was going to make some real bank off this job!\c\nAnd then...you had to come along and try to\n“rescue” me...\c\nMan, I want to cry right now...\nBut I know you were just trying to help.\c\nI can’t get mad for what you did...\nSo here... Just take this...
Now get lost...\nAnd don’t you talk to me again...

Hey. I’d like to say welcome to my shop,\nbut I’m afraid I just can’t do that right now.
Peli peli!
That fellow is my partner.\nPelly the Pelipper.\c\nHe helps me out with making deliveries, using\nthat big old beak and that throat pouch of his.
Peli peli.
I normally travel around the islands, dealing my\nwares wherever I come ashore.\c\nBut I’ve been here at Poni for quite a while now,\nand my supplies have pretty much run dry.
I’m in a real slump, and Pelly here is pretty much\ncrying out in boredom.
... ... ...
Hey! You’re supposed to be crying out, I said!\nWhat kind of partner are you?!
... ... ...
Why you...
Anyway, I do appreciate you taking the time\nto stop by anyway, so I hope you’ll take these.
Those two are real valuable power boosters!
I know it’s a generous gift, but that’s just who\nI am! Right, Pelly?\c\nPelly?
... ... ...
Come on! Throw me a bone here, Pelly!\nI thought you were my partner!
I really should be heading out onto the waves\nagain soon, but it’s so nice around here.\c\nWe seafolk and our chief and even me, we all\ncouldn’t seem to help but fall in love with Poni.

I’m [VAR TRNAME(0000)]

Oh, sure! I remember now.\nSorry, I’m no good with names.
...You sure about that?\nHow long have you known him then, hm?\c\nGa ha ha! I’m just joshing you, kid.\nI like to see a kid with confidence.\c\nBut I think I know who you really are.\nYou’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], ain’t you?
I’m Kiawe’s old man.\nI’m glad he’s made friends like you.\c\nYou’re the first-ever Champion in Alola,\nain’t you?\c\nAnd at that tender age even!\nThat’s quite the accomplishment, kid.
I reckon I ought to give you a little gift to help\nyou celebrate becoming Champion, then.
Give that there to a Rhydon to hold, and then\ntrade it with a friend. You’ll see what happens.\c\nCourse there are no Rhydon native to Alola, but\nif you ever find one, give it a try for me, eh?
That boy of mine was pretty happy to hear that\nyou’d become Champion like that.\c\nI hope you’ll stay friends with him. He may not\nlook it, but he’s always been a lonely child.

If you want to know about the weather, you’re\nin the right place! This is the Weather Class!
But you’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nThen how about a quiz that takes weather into\nthe arena of Pokémon battles?\c\nIt will take a bit longer doing it like this, but I’ll\ngive you a reward if you can keep up!
It looks like you have what it takes.\nThen tell me, my good Trainer...\c\nWhich item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Rain Dance to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m not beaten yet!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Damp Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Hail to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep falling for eight whole turns!\c\nBut I’ve still got some HP in me!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Icy Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep on falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want sunshine that goes on for ages?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m still in this match!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Heat Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want a sandstorm to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Smooth Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
The most important part of any education is\nputting it to work in the real world.\c\nIt’s not enough to understand it in your head.\nYou’ve got to know it in your bones!\c\nThat’s why I’ll give you this set of rocks I’ve\ncollected for your own use.
There are lots of ways to use the weather to\nyour advantage in battles, so give it a try.\c\nLike you could use rain to power up your\nWater-type moves or to weaken the Fire-type\r\nmoves someone might use against you.\c\nOr you could call a sandstorm to deal damage\nevery turn to any Pokémon that isn’t a Rock,\r\nGround, or Steel type.
An Icy Rock
A Smooth Rock
A Heat Rock
A Damp Rock

Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!
...Hold on a second there, pal.\c\nYou look to me like a kid...\c\nbuuut I can tell just by looking at you that you’re\na pretty decent Trainer.\c\nSure, I’m just a part-time worker now, pounding\naway at the register with a smile on my face,\r\nbut once I was a Trainer, traveling around on\r\nmy island challenge, too.
I even made a pretty fair name for myself.\nKagetora the Eevee User, that was me.\c\nBut then I got a wife, and then I had a kid...\nNow I face a new trial called a mortgage.\c\nAnd I work here to prepare me for the most\ngrand trial of all: old age and retirement!
...But never mind all that.\c\nLook, there’s something I’d like to ask an able\nyoung Trainer like you to do for me.\c\nBack in my heyday, there were these eight older\nTrainers I was always trying to beat.\c\nThey all used Pokémon that evolve from Eevee.\c\nHow would you feel about taking them on?\c\nIf you say that Kagetora sent you, I’m sure\nthey’ll agree to a battle.
If you can beat them all for me, I’ll have\nsomething to give you. It’ll be worth it.\c\nSo just ask me if you want to know more about\nany of ’em.
Oh, it’s you again.\c\nSo how’s that favor coming along?\nNeed me to tell you about an opponent?
The Vaporeon User
The Flareon User
The Jolteon User
The Espeon User
The Umbreon User
The Glaceon User
The Leafeon User
The Sylveon User
No, I’m good
The Vaporeon User, Polly...\nThey called her the Wild Whirlpool of Alola.\c\nShe was a cool drink of water, all right.\nA bikini-clad beauty who beat all the boys.\c\nHer Vaporeon’s Hydro Pump could blast through\nsolid steel plating...\c\nShe was from Melemele originally, and I think\nshe trained to be a teacher...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The fiery magician, brimming with life...\nChad the Flareon User.\c\nHis temper burned as hot as any flame, and he\nwas always quick to find a fight.\c\nHis Flareon’s fire attacks were relentless, going\nafter opponents like a living thing.\c\nI know he always stayed at the Tide Song Hotel\nback in those days...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
Oh yes. The electrifying ball of energy that was\nJane the Jolteon User...\c\nShe looked like a lovely young Lass, but beneath\nthat sweet face was the heart of a tyrant...\c\nHer Jolteon slammed into opponents like a bolt\nof lightning from a blue sky...\c\nLast I heard, she was working somewhere\non Ula’ula Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The Espeon User, Ishaan...\nThe sun itself was charmed by his sweet looks.\c\nHis Espeon danced past enemy attacks, letting\nthem slide right off it like some kinda miracle.\c\nIshaan worked at the Geothermal Power Plant\nback in those days, but now...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
The immortal ruler of the night...\nBraiden the Umbreon User.\c\nThe rumors say that he died once and came\nback to life. Everyone was afraid of him.\c\nHis Umbreon gave off its horrifying aura all the\ntime and never let up...\c\nHe used to hold some kind of ceremony in the\ncemetery on Melemele Island every night...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
Miss Absolute Zero...\nRea the Glaceon User.\c\nThat cool beauty seemed to have a soul of ice\nwhen she mercilessly pursued her opponents.\c\nEven time froze around her Glaceon!\c\nI know that she originally came from some small\nvillage on Melemele Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
A goddess of beauty in full bloom...\nLinnea the Leafeon User.\c\nShe was a world-famous model and a powerful\nGrass-type Pokémon user.\c\nWhen her Leafeon cried out, even withered and\ndead trees burst into bloom once more...\c\nShe used to always stay at the Hano Grand\nResort when she was between gigs...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The queen of Fairy Pokémon...\nYes, Sakura the Sylveon User.\c\nThat pure young maiden was adored by Fairy-\ntype Pokémon, who saw her as a queen.\c\nEven wild beasts were captivated when her\nSylveon appeared before them...\c\nI heard that she was a descendant of the\nnomadic seafolk...\c\nThat’s the best hint I can give you to find her.
Got it.\nRemember, I’m counting on you, kid.
Oh, it’s you.\c\nWait, what?! You beat them all?!\nWhat happened then?!
... ...\n... ...\c\nTime truly is cruel to us all, isn’t it?\c\nFine then. I’m ready now.
I have one last favor to ask of you.\nWould you let me have a battle?
Of course
Hold on
If I do this, I think I’ll be ready...to let go.
I understand... I’ll wait.
Enough. It’s enough.\nOur day has come...and it has gone.\c\nBut I haven’t forgotten your reward.\nHere. I want you to take this.
I used that crystal back when I was a young\nTrainer, but I don’t need it now.\c\nYou use it and you build a new age.\c\nI’ll stay here and take care of the mortgage and\nthe old age.
You’re not one of the students, are you?\nWhat do you want from an old cleaning lady?
Are you the Vaporeon User?
It’s nothing...
...Well, yes, I suppose I am.\c\nWhat’s that? Kagetora sent you to battle me?\c\nI don’t mind. But no complaints out of you for\nhaving to take on this bent old woman!
Every rain cloud has its end...\nAnd no one can win against time’s march.\c\nNow I’m retired from training, and I spend my\ndays with Vaporeon cleaning these windows.\c\nBut how is that boy Kagetora doing?\nIs he well?
...Yes? What is it?\nDo you need something from me?
Are you the Flareon User?
It’s nothing...
Oh...\nAh...\c\nI see...\nSo you know Kagetora?\c\nYou would like a Pokémon battle from me?\nHow...nostalgic. It’s been quite some time.
A fire needs fuel to keep on burning.\nBut once the fuel is burnt up, only ash remains.\c\nMy working life is over. I’ve reached retirement.\nAll that is left of my life is the ashes.\c\nMe and Flareon are done with battling.\nI’d rather just go to lomi lomi and relax.
Ya-a-awn...\nThe old eyes are getting tired...
Are you the Jolteon User?
It’s nothing...
...Why, yes, I suppose I am. I’m Jane.\c\nEevee? Kagetora?\nI’m sorry, child. I don’t remember them...\c\nI do remember Pokémon battles, though...\nThough I’m not sure if I’m still up to one...
When lightning strikes the earth, it is swallowed\nup...and it disappears.\c\nEven if you try to whip an old body into action,\nthere are simply limits to what it can do.\c\nAnd besides...I really don’t remember anyone\ncalled Kagetora.
I suppose I should be moving...\nI’ll need to fix Espeon some supper...
Are you the Espeon User?
It’s nothing...
Why, that’s a question I haven’t heard in many\nlong years. I am Ishaan, if that’s what you mean.\c\nKagetora?\c\nOh! Oh yes! I remember that boy!\nNow that is a tale that takes me back...\c\nAnd you want to have a battle with me?\c\nI suppose I could, but please keep in mind\nthat I am an old man.
Even the sun itself, who rises with such glory\nin the morning, must eventually set.\c\nSo it is for human life, and I think...\nI think that I see the moon rising on the horizon.\c\nBut what about that Kagetora?\nHe’s not that much younger than me...\c\nDo tell him I said hello.
I suppose that’s enough for today...\c\nI’d better hurry home or that son of mine will\ngo berating me again for wandering off...
Are you the Umbreon User?
It’s nothing...
...That tale is decades old by now.\nHow old are you, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl?\c\nWell, you’re not wrong.\nI was once known as Braiden the Umbreon User.\c\nAnd you know young Kagetora?\nHow is that little whippersnapper?\c\nSure, I don’t mind battling with you...\nThough I’m due to check in to the hospital soon.
No night can ever be endless.\nDawn comes and snatches away the dark.\c\nI feel that light creeping into my life, blotting\nout the stars and stealing away the night.\c\nPeople used to talk about me once.\nSaid I was immortal and such nonsense.\r\nI was just in the hospital a long while, that’s all.\r\nBut human life does end.\r\nAnyway...you give Kagetora my regards.
It’s about time for my appointment with\nthe beautician...
Are you the Leafeon User?
It’s nothing...
W-well...yes, I suppose I am.\nWho might you be, child?\c\nOh! A friend of sweet little Kagetora’s?\c\nOf course I’d be delighted to battle you!\nI still have some spirit left in me!
The flower that blooms will wilt and fall.\nThe stalk will wither and return to the earth.\c\nBut not for Leafeon and me!\nWe refuse to accept such a reality.\c\nI will do everything that money and medicine\ncan do to keep my looks!\c\nBut my bones can’t help telling the truth.\nAt any rate, do say hello to Kagetora for me.
When is that grandson of mine coming home?
Are you the Glaceon User?
It’s nothing...
Well... I am Rea, who used to always use\na Glaceon in battle.\c\nYou’re friends with that Kagetora?\c\nSure, I’ll battle you.\nI’ll get it over with in no time, don’t you worry.
Even the drifting snow will melt away.\c\nThe only thing I want out of life now is to spend\nas much time as I can with my grandchildren.\c\nYou tell Kagetora that’s my biggest worry now.\nI don’t want him sending more Trainers after me.
Then I’ve got to go and get Sylveon some snacks\nat the malasada shop...and...
Are you the Sylveon User?
It’s nothing...
...You’re looking for the Sylveon User Sakura?\nThat’s my grandma!\c\nAnd that Kagetora guy asked you to come\nvisit her?\c\nBut my grandma died last year, you know?\c\nOh, I know!\c\nHere, I keep Sylveon now, so how about I battle\nyou instead!
The sweetest part of life is when you’re cute.\nBut the sweetest part is also the shortest.\c\nThat’s what my grandma told me.\c\nMaybe you can tell that to your Mr. Kagetora\nor whomever!
Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!\c\nHmm. You look like a Trainer, but I can tell that\nyou’re still just getting started.\c\nIf you can become the strongest Trainer in all\nAlola, why don’t you come talk to me again?

Lomi lomi is the style of massage we practice\nhere in Alola.\r\nHow about a treatment for your Pokémon?\r\nIt will make them feel more friendly toward you.\c\nWhat do you say? Can I do a little lomi lomi on\nthat [VAR PKNAME(0000)] you have there?
If you ever want to experience the joys of\nlomi lomi massage, just stop by our shop here.
Then allow me to just take [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nthere for a moment...
[~ 3]
There we go!\c\nIt was a really productive session of lomi lomi.\nI think you’ll notice a lot of friendly feelings!
There we go!\c\nI think that lomi lomi session helped inspire\nsome good, friendly feelings toward you.
There we go!\c\nI think this session was a good start. It’s feeling\na bit more friendly toward you already, I’d say.
I can only manage one session of lomi lomi per\nday, but do feel free to come again tomorrow!
Do you want to know if your Pokémon feel\nfriendly toward you or not?
I understand. Sometimes knowing can be\nworse than not knowing.
Then I’ll have a look at your [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\nthere, shall I?
My! It feels incredibly close to you!\nNothing makes it happier than being with you!
You clearly love your [VAR PKNAME(0000)], and you\nmust spend a lot of time together.
Hm. I’d say that you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)] have\nthe potential to be an even greater combo.
Hmmm. I think...it feels friendly toward you.\nAt least a little...
Hmmm... I’d say that you and your Pokémon\nstill have a long way to go.
What is going on here? Do you let it get knocked\nout a lot in battles or something? This is bad.
Oh dear. You must be a merciless Trainer...\nDo you use Frustration or just not know better?
Oh tapu! How could you leave it like this?!\nTake it to a Pokémon Center right now!
You’re curious about an Egg?\nYou must want to meet whatever is inside soon!

This place here is a haven where children and\nPokémon can rest and be at peace.\c\nBut I’m in the middle of cleaning right now, so\nI’ll have to ask you to leave.
I know you. Thanks to your efforts, both the\npresident and the foundation were saved.\r\nThat’s what I’ve heard.
I would like to entrust you with a very precious\nPokémon, as a show of gratitude from myself.\c\nWill you take this Porygon from me?
It looks like your Boxes are full, though.\nPlease make some space and come back again.
Porygon is a miracle born of science.\nA Pokémon with a digital brain.
Science exists to lead us to a brighter future.\c\nAnd I am here to protect those who will inherit\nthat future.
The Aether Foundation funds this facility.\c\nPeople and Pokémon can all live here, as equals\nand as family.
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], aren’t you?\nI heard about you from Ms. Wicke.\c\nAs a member of the foundation, I’m grateful to\nyou...so please take this.
I believe that the foundation will change after...\nwell...all that ruckus that happened.\c\nWe will reflect on our errors and remake the\nfoundation as something even more than it was.\c\nWe will work hard to update and improve.
I can admit that I did wonder for a time about\nwhether I should quit the foundation.\c\nBut I want to keep protecting the smiles of the\nchildren and the Pokémon here.

That’s right.\nYou don’t need anything more to carry now.
But you can’t carry any more!

Bwo! Bwo!\nBwooorrrrrr!
I wouldn’t tease that one.\nIf you do, he’ll buck and kick you.
Tauros are generally known as spirited Pokémon,\nbut this fellow is pretty feisty even for a Tauros.\c\nBut I guess it’s not that surprising, considering\nhow new he is to the ranch.
I’d like him to train to become a Ride Pokémon.\c\nBut I can’t even put him through his paces if\nhe bucks at every little thing like this.
I guess we’ll need the mistress’s skill for\nthis one!
The mistress?
Is that you?
The mistress of Paniola Ranch, of course!\nShe can get even the most unruly Tauros\r\nsnapped right into line!
Me? Ridiculous!\nHahahahah!\c\nYou think the mistress is some weak little girl?
Right then.\nIt’s time we call the mistress!
Here she is...the mistress of the ranch!\nMiltank!
Moooo moooo!
One roar from Miltank and even the most ornery\nTauros is instantly as quiet as a little Litten!
Mil moooooo!
Mooo!\nMo-mo mo moooooo!
Mroooowwwrrrr!
Mooooooooo!
Hff! Mooo!\nMooorrrrrrrrr!
Well, they do say the stronger the Tauros is,\nthe harder it is to control.\c\nLooks like even the mistress is having a tough\ntime with this one.
Maybe if he burns off a bit of excess energy,\nit’ll be a bit easier to bring him to heel...\c\nWhat do you think?\nHow about taking on Tauros in a battle?
Sure, I’ll battle
Maybe later...
Then don’t hold back!\nGo all out against this one!
Really? I thought it’d be a great help to us if\nyou could do it...
Looks like you worked up a fine sweat!\nI think Tauros feels pretty satisfied, too.
Bwoooooor!
Moooooo!\nMo-mo mooo!
Mo... Hff...
Even Tauros couldn’t stand up to the combined\npowers of the pair of you and Miltank!
Thanks, sweetie!\nJust what we expect of the ranch’s mistress!
Mil-mooooooooo!
Thanks to you, I think we can finally start on\nthis fellow’s Ride Pokémon training.\c\nSo I hope you’ll take this Scope Lens from me!\nGive it to a Pokémon to hold, and its moves\r\nwill be more likely to land as critical hits!
With Ride Pokémon, even people who aren’t\nPokémon Trainers can enjoy a convenient life.
Bwooorrr!
None of our Tauros dare slack off as long as the\nmistress is watching! Hah!
Mil-moooooo!

So...so...
Cooor!
This Pokémon seems to be hurt...\nWhat will you do?
Use a Potion on it
Take it to a Pokémon Center
Sorry, sorry, sorry!\nI know! I took way too long!\c\n...Huh?
I just left my Pokémon here to play for a little bit\nwhile I was shopping in town.\c\nI checked that there weren’t any Pokémon here\nthat would bully my Corsola but...\c\nBut there was a Mareanie hiding in the rocks!\nOooh! I want to fish it up and show it my wrath!
Mareanie love breaking off and eating Corsola’s\nbranches more than anything else in the world!\c\nThey hunt Corsola down mercilessly to gnaw\nand nibble on their branches!\c\nSure, the Corsola’s branches can regenerate\nand they’ll eventually grow back, but...\r\nThat doesn’t make it any less scary for Corsola!
You were worried about my Corsola and trying\nto help them, weren’t you?\c\nThank you. You’re a really nice Trainer.\c\nHere, take this from me. If your Pokémon is hit\nwith a Water-type move while holding this,\r\nits Sp. Def will get a boost!
Come on, let’s get you both all better.\nOff to the Pokémon Center!

This is a resort, right?
Oh, my dad owns the Hano Grand Resort, so...\c\nAnyway. You’re the Champion now, right?\nSo are you out there training every day?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Of course!
Uhhh...what?
Just what I would expect of a Champion!\nThat is very wise thinking.\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You’re the Champion, aren’t you?\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day![VAR 0114(0019)]
I think it’s important to keep training every day,\neven if it’s for just a bit.\c\nI’ll give you this. It should help you aim for\neven loftier goals![VAR 0114(0019)]
Many Flying-type Pokémon are fast, right?\c\nThat’s why I use Trick Room to up my handicap.\c\nIt forces me to train in battles where the slower\nPokémon get to move first.[VAR 0114(0019)]

Hi, can I get a table?[VAR 0114(0009)]

This right here! This is it!\c\nI may live on my own, but sometimes even I need\nthat familiar taste of home cooking.\c\nDig in, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], before it gets cold![VAR 0114(0009)]
*munch munch munch*\nUgh! What is this?\c\nThe thick soup is sour, and the fish fillet is\nfull of little bones!\c\nThe patty is too moist and leaves sticky juices\ndripping down your chin...\c\nAnd whatever the mysterious grayish thing is\non the side, it doesn’t taste of anything...
It was delicious!
Ugh... It’s no good...\nYou can’t eat another bite...
Ah... That was delicious.\c\nMaybe it’s about time I find someone to cook for\nmyself, huh?\c\nOh! But look at your plate, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’ve barely touched a thing!\c\nLocal flavors not your thing?[VAR 0114(0009)]

*slurp slurp*\nMm! It’s delicious!\c\nThe clear soup has a light, refreshing taste\nbut also a certain richness to it.\c\nThe thin noodles are slippery, but they have\njust the right amount of chewiness, too!
*slurp slurp*\nMm! It’s delicious!\c\nThe noodles and the vegetables are balanced\nand portioned perfectly. It’s pretty filling...\c\nbut the taste is so enticing that it feels like you\ncould keep eating bowl after bowl!

And here it is!\c\nWhen I am too busy working our fields to get\na proper meal in, I always depend on the good\r\nfolks here to help keep me fed.\c\nYou sure end up with a mighty appetite after\na pleasant bit of work![VAR 0114(000B)]

Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon’s\nHP for them.\c\nYou can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one\nhold a Berry and they’ll eat it when they need it.
By the way, young one.\c\nAre you interested in becoming a Berry master?
You look quite promising.\c\nAll right. First of all, get a Persim Berry!
Oho? Are you being shy?\c\nIf you want to become a Berry master, don’t be\nshy. Just talk to me.

Let me see.\nDid you get a Persim Berry?
Whoa! You have a Persim Berry!\c\nI don’t know if you picked it from a Berry tree\nor your Pokémon had it, but that’s a great\r\nstart to becoming a Berry master!\c\nI’ll offer this as a reward.
A Persim Berry heals confusion!\nA Pecha Berry heals poison status!\c\nAnd a Sitrus Berry restores more HP than an\nOran Berry!
Alola is great!\c\nYou can get plenty of Berries without planting\nBerries in a Berry field!\c\nBut some Pokémon gather around trees trying to\nget Berries as well!
Mufufu! If you get a Persim Berry,\nplease show it to me.
If you’re ever looking for more Berries,\nyou won’t have to look Berry hard!\c\nWa ha ha ha!\c\nBerries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola,\nso feel free to pick up any you find!

What is it? Has something happened?\nOr do you need some information from me?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Tell me about the UB
Tell me about the Beast Balls
I finished the mission!
Never mind
UB-01. Code name: “Symbiont.”\nYes, I can tell you about Nihilego!\c\nNihilego is a terrifying, parasitic beast that\ncan use humans or Pokémon as hosts.\c\nThe sightings report a single specimen.\c\nSightings were made in two locations.\c\nThe Wela Volcano Park...and Diglett’s Tunnel!\c\nIt seems highly likely that the creature is on\nthe move around Akala Island.[VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-02. Code name: “Absorption.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt appears to be quite a dangerous UB that\ncan boast of some fantastic musculature!\c\nSightings were made in Melemele Meadow.\c\nAnd the sightings report two specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect two individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-02. Code name: “Beauty.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt appears to be a very dangerous and beautiful\nUB that can move with great speed!\c\nSightings were made in Verdant Cavern.\c\nAnd the sightings report four specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect four individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-03. Code name: “Lighting.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt appears to be an Ultra Beast that can wield\ntremendous electric power—as its name implies!\c\nSightings were made in two locations.\c\nLush Jungle and Memorial Hill!\c\nIt seems highly likely that the creatures are on\nthe move around Akala Island.\c\nThe sightings indicate two specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect two individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt seems to be a horrifying beast that can cut\nthrough absolutely anything!\c\nSightings were made in two locations.\c\nRoute 17 and Malie Garden!\c\nIt seems highly likely that the creatures are on\nthe move around Ula’ula Island.\c\nThe sightings indicate four specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect four individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-04. Code name: “Blaster.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt seems to possess a fearsome energy that\nwill burn through anything at all!\c\nSightings were made in two locations.\c\nHaina Desert and Malie Garden!\c\nIt seems highly likely that the creatures are on\nthe move around Ula’ula Island.\c\nThe sightings indicate two specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect two individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
UB-05. Code name: “Glutton.”\nYes, yes, I can tell you about it.\c\nIt possesses a fearsome appetite that allows it\nto be devouring mountains!\c\nThe sightings report a single specimen.\c\nNanu should be leading it deep into the heart\nof Resolution Cave.\c\nBut Resolution Cave—it is really so far away.\c\nYou have to go farther and farther from the\nAncient Poni Path—even past Poni Meadow.\c\nThat’s where Resolution Cave is.\c\nIt must be tough to reach there, but you should\ndo your best, I implore.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh ho, how funny you are, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWe’ve caught all the UBs already, haven’t we?\c\nI’m certain that black refractor that I thought\nI saw on Melemele was just my imagination![VAR 0114(001F)]
Beast Balls are incredibly valuable Poké Balls!\c\nI asked Madam Wicke, who works in the secret\nlabs, and she said a single ball costs millions!\c\nIt appears you still have some on you, as well.\nBe very careful about using them![VAR 0114(001F)]
What?! You mean you ran out of Beast Balls?!\c\nWell...then I suppose I must give you one of the\nextras that I have been holding in reserve![VAR 0114(001F)]
You have succeeded in the capture of...[VAR NUM1(0001)] UB[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s!\c\nYou’ve nearly done it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDo your best, young friend![VAR 0114(001F)]
You must not lie to the International Police!\nI will overlook it this once, but be warned![VAR 0114(001F)]
Amazing! Bravo! You have done it!\nI must call the chief back at once![VAR 0114(001F)]
Roger that, my young companion.\nThen be careful as you go on your way![VAR 0114(001F)]
Ah yes, the matter of the UBs.\c\nDisclosing info on this is prohibited, so let’s\nplease keep this between you and me.\c\nFirst, please take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The International Police asked me to pass them\nto you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What are they?
Poké Balls?
Those are Beast Balls, which the Aether\nFoundation developed in great secrecy...\c\nThey are a special kind of Poké Ball that are\nspecialized for capturing Ultra Beasts.\c\nAs a result, they are very expensive to make, so\nwe have not been able to mass-produce them.\c\nPlease consider your timing very carefully for\nwhen you will use them during a battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The appearance of the UBs is something that\nwe at the foundation are to blame for...\c\nThat is why I will do whatever is within my\npower to assist you in this.\c\nFor now, perhaps you should return to Ms.\nAnabel at the motel in Akala.\c\nShe may have discovered new info.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Please just ask if there’s ever anything that\nI can help explain, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
Tell me about the Beast Balls
What’s special about the UBs?
Show me the UB data
Nihilego
Buzzwole
Pheromosa
Xurkitree
Kartana
Celesteela
Guzzlord
Never mind
Ultra Beasts are life-forms from another world.\c\nIf you try to throw a regular Poké Ball at one,\nthe ball will have a difficult time recognizing the\r\ncreature as a Pokémon, and so the capturing\r\nfunction will be significantly impaired.\c\nBut these special balls should allow you to\ncapture beasts quite normally.\c\nThey could be considered the foundation’s\nnegative assets, but I hope they will help you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The UBs surround themselves with an aura\ncalled the Beast Boost.\c\nThe truth of this aura is that it is the energy\nthat flows within the Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWhen the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole,\nthey are bathed in a great deal of this energy\r\nand likely store it within their bodies.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There are also Pokémon on our planet that\npossess this same kind of energy.\c\nI think you know what I mean.\c\nThe so-called Totem Pokémon that you faced in\nyour trials.\c\nThis is because the energy pours down upon\nour planet when the holes open.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Which Ultra Beast would you like to learn\nmore about?[VAR 0114(0016)]
UB-01. Code name: “Symbiont.”\nProperly known as Nihilego.\c\nThere have been sightings reported of this\nbeast in Alola’s past.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its parasitic\ncapability.\c\nWhen Nihilego latches on to a host, it does not\nmanipulate its actions directly.\c\nRather it awakens the host’s own capabilities\nand boosts them to an extreme extent in order\r\nto protect itself.
It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to\nachieve this effect.\c\nThis neurotoxin of Nihilego’s is incredibly\nstimulating and inspires feelings of extreme\r\nexcitement and a lack of inhibition in its host.\c\nIn other words, anything or anyone that a\nNihilego latches on to will have its native skills\r\nforcibly activated to their fullest extent and will\r\nthen act as it naturally desires to.
UB-02. Code name: “Absorption.”\nProperly known as Buzzwole.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its skill to\nstrengthen itself.\c\nBuzzwole is able to absorb energy and then\nachieve a chemical reaction between the energy\r\nit has absorbed and its own body fluids.
As a result, Buzzwole’s body swells to an\nalmost explosive extent.\c\nIts muscles bulge and are so thick and dense\nthat they are stronger even than steel.\c\nBoth its Attack and Defense experience a clear\nleap in power.\c\nIt also displays a habit of striking a pose each\ntime that it takes any sort of action...\c\nIt is thought this might serve as a method of\ncommunication, but it is not well understood.
UB-02. Code name: “Beauty.”\nProperly known as Pheromosa.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nThis UB can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph\nin just an instant.\c\nThis speed is greater than any other living\ncreature that has been discovered to date.\c\nBut its most distinctive features may in fact be\nits beauty and its powerful pheromones.
Most any creature that squares off against a\nPheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by\r\nthe beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight.\c\nIt is still a subject of research, but it’s thought\nthat Pheromosa may possess some sort of\r\norgan able to produce a pheromonal substance\r\npreviously unknown to science.
UB-03. Code name: “Lighting.”\nProperly known as Xurkitree.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is an organ that\ncan generate power.\c\nThis UB’s bodily makeup is highly reminiscent\nof electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct\r\nelectricity with great efficiency.
It can discharge as much as a million volts of\npower at a time.\c\nWhen it begins to run out of power, it stabs its\nlegs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike\r\nstate as it absorbs electricity from the ground.
UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nProperly known as Kartana.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-\nsharp body, of which every edge has as cruel\r\na cutting edge as any well-honed blade.\c\nThe edges on its arms are particularly in a class\nof their own.
Any opponent who tries to attack it will be\ncut down with a single strike of its “blades.”\c\nIts thin body also allows it to evade attacks by\ndancing lightly out of the way.\c\nThis is a very dangerous creature, considering\nits excellent offensive and defensive\r\ncapabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it\r\nis also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.
UB-04. Code name: “Blaster.”\nProperly known as Celesteela.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is the energy that\nit stores within itself, a flammable gas that it\r\ncan shoot from its two huge arms.
This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and\nfor battle, but it is thought to have sufficient\r\npower and lift to even fly into space.\c\nIts bodily construction closely resembles that of\na plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.
UB-05. Code name: “Glutton.”\nProperly known as Guzzlord.\c\nThis UB has been sighted in the Alola region\nin the past as well, according to our reports.\c\nIt seems it was targeted by the International\nPolice in a top-secret mission at that time.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its limitless\nappetite. It feeds without pause every moment\r\nthat it is awake.
It uses the two large tongues that protrude from\nits mouth to catch and devour everything in its\r\npath, be it organic or inorganic matter.\c\nAnd while it eats such an inordinate amount,\nGuzzlord excreta has never been discovered.\c\nIt is thought that it might fully convert the\nthings that it eats into energy for it to use.
Please...do be careful.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hm? What is this Pokédex data,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\n...Necrozma.\c\nIt’s black, yet it’s refracting light...\c\nBut we haven’t had any word from HQ about\nsuch a UB.\c\nIt must be simply a rare Pokémon.\nStill, it’s quite remarkable, though![VAR 0114(001F)]

Hey. You.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You are the one they call [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am
Not me
Hm...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I can see right through any lies you tell, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0030)]
A certain...interested party sent me here\nto you...to give you this.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You should have a look at what it says.[VAR 0114(0030)]
But take care where you read it.\nNo one else is to know of my visit or that card.[VAR 0114(0030)]
So you actually came...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Mustn’t you?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Please, you’ll have to forgive me for my stunning\ndisguise earlier.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m very grateful that you accepted my invitation\nto join me here in my room.\c\nMy name...it is Looker.\nI am a member of the International Police.[VAR 0114(0030)]
And this figure here is my boss...[VAR 0114(001F)]
It is an honor to meet you, of course,\nthe first Champion of Alola.\c\nPlease forgive our rude summons.\c\nMy name is Anabel.\c\nI am the head of a secret division within the\nInternational Police. We are the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Please forgive me for the most sudden question,\nbut I must ask...\c\nis it true that you encountered UB Symbiont?[VAR 0114(001F)]
UB?
Symbiont?
The UBs are the beasts...\notherwise known as Ultra Beasts.\c\nThey are unidentified life-forms that reside in\na different world from the one we live in.\c\nThat Nihilego creature you encountered was\none such beast.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, UB-01...Symbiont.\nI suppose you knew it as Nihilego.\c\nThe International Police refers to all of the\nUBs by code names, like Symbiont there.\c\nI believe you might recognize it as the Pokémon\nthat the woman Lusamine fused with?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now that we have cleared that up, please allow\nme to ask once more.\c\nDid you come in contact with Symbiont?\nThat is, with Nihilego?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I did
I beat it
Just as we had thought...[VAR 0114(0029)]
That seems to settle things, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Listen. Everything that we are about to share\nwith you is highly classified information.\c\nWe must ask that you keep all that you learn\nhere to yourself.\c\nThe incident that Ms. Lusamine caused...\nSymbiont wasn’t the only UB to appear from\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole that was temporarily\r\nopened at that time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We have confirmed the presence of another\nSymbiont, other than the one you encountered.\r\nAnd we have received reports of sightings of\r\nseveral other types of UBs...\c\nThe UBs are dangerous beings whose powers\nexceed the boundaries and logic of our world.\c\nAnd they were dropped rudely into this world\nagainst their own will...\c\nWe can only expect that they will be extremely\nwary and combative.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And so we have been tasked with three duties.\c\nThe first is to investigate the ecology of these\nunidentified UBs.\c\nThe second is to look out for UBs and protect\nthe people from any harm.\c\nAnd the third is to either protect the UBs...\nor destroy them...[VAR 0114(0029)]
If the UBs are destructive beings that will seek\nsome sort of revenge upon our world, then the\r\norder from above is to erase them completely.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But neither myself nor Looker would like to see\nthat happen.\c\nEven if they are UBs, they are living creatures.\nWe would like to protect them and save them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But protecting the UBs...\c\nit would seem to amount to catching them,\nand that is a more difficult task than simply\r\ndestroying them would be.\c\nWe do not currently have the battle power\nnecessary to achieve such a goal.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And so we finally arrive at the point.\nLet us dispense with any pretense...\c\nWe wish for you, the Champion of Alola, to\nlend us your assistance.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nwe want you to join our team.\c\nPlease give your aid to the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Sure!
What?!
Please...\nWe want to save the UBs.\c\nBut to do that, we will need your strength...[VAR 0114(0029)]
You accept?\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0029)]
So that means, Chief...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I know, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
It is only a formality, but I still must test you\nto ensure that you can handle this job.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nMay I ask you to join me in a battle?\c\nI will wait until you are ready, so do whatever\npreparations you need and then speak with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You will want to prepare quite well for this.\nMy boss is a very tough lady.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So you’re ready for me?\nLet’s begin then, shall we?\c\nLet me see your talent in its entirety.\nNo need to hold back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you...\nI believe the testing is complete.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I see no problem at all with your skills.\nRather I would have to praise you for them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope that we will do fine work together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So now you are a member of our team, young\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You are most welcome!\c\nThen there is no time to be wasting.\nLet us begin your first job!\c\nThe chief and I will set out to gather more\ninformation about the UBs.\c\nWe want to ask you to visit the secret labs in\nthe bottom of Aether Paradise![VAR 0114(001F)]
There you should find our other partner in this\nendeavor. The vice-chief of the Alolan branch\r\nof the Aether Foundation: Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
She will know why you’ve come.\c\nNow set forth, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
The lower floors of Aether Paradise.\c\nThat is where you must go to find the secret\nlabs and to meet with Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Welcome back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
It would seem that you managed to meet with\nMs. Wicke.\c\nI also expect Mr. Looker will return shortly...[VAR 0114(0029)]
È un disastro![VAR 0114(001F)]
Is...something the matter, Mr. Looker?\nIf you spoke in English, I might understand.\c\nWhat has you so bothered?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! It is a terrible habit I picked up.\nBut we do have a disaster in the making!\c\nSightings are being reported of another UB-01!\nIt is Symbiont!\c\nAnd the perp has been right here in Akala,\nright under our very noses![VAR 0114(001F)]
I understand.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nyou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and coordinate\nour backup, if we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I see...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Backup is a vital part of any operation,\nMr. Looker.\c\nWe are entrusting our safety to you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I will be going ahead.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], stay safe![VAR 0114(0029)]
Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
Young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDo take care and keep yourself safe out there!\c\nIf you ever are in need of more information,\nyou may come talk with me![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWith this development, I think we will be able\nto solve the mysteries surrounding Nihilego.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well! Regardless of all that, congratulations are\nin order, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI, the great Looker, think I shall provide a great\nfeast to celebrate your great success and\r\nyour addition to our team!\c\nThere are some rather tasty restaurants here\non this island, after all![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? But how would you know that, Mr. Looker?\c\nWe have only just arrived in Alola...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Urm! I read about them in a magazine they had\nat the local Pokémon Center!\c\nD-don’t you worry yourself about the details!\nI’ll go and ask if they don’t do delivery.[VAR 0114(001F)]
My goodness...\nThat Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh yes.\nThere was one other thing I wanted to tell you.\c\nThe original plan was that the UB you caught\nwould be collected by the International Police.\c\nHowever, we have been able to secure official\npermission for you to keep it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
It was a bit of a hassle to get all the details\nironed out, but...\c\nIf we take the UB to headquarters, it would\nend up as a research subject.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I expect it will be much happier staying with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
C’est une catastrophe![VAR 0114(001F)]
M-Mr. Looker...\nYes? What is it this time?\r\nIn English, if you please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! It is just a habit of mine!\nBut never mind that—we have a disaster!\c\nI got a tip about a new UB sighting!\c\nThis time the sighting was on Melemele Island.\nI’m sorry, but we’ll have to put off our feast![VAR 0114(001F)]
I understand.\c\nLet us hurry to Melemele Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
I will go ahead to Melemele Island and set up a\nnew base of operations at the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you’re ready,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
We make for Melemele at once!\nWe’re trusting in you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nDon’t forget: the Melemele motel is on Route 2![VAR 0114(001F)]

Oh? Looks like you’re a trial-goer, eh?\nI’ve got a favor to ask of you then.
I’d be happy to help
I’m too busy
...Oh. So that’s how it is, eh?\c\nNo time to listen to an old lady’s problems,\nis that right?
Route 10 here is long and wide, and it’s a great\nplace to let your Pokémon play a bit.\c\nMy Stufful hadn’t been getting much exercise\nlately, so I let them out of their balls to have\r\nthem run around a bit...\c\nBut they haven’t come back!\c\nI want to go look for them, but it’s hard for\nan old lady like me to traipse all around...
If you find one of my little Stufful, you just tell\nthem to come back to me.\c\nThey’re impish creatures, but smart as a cookie\nand with noses that could sniff out anything.\r\nThey’ll find their way back home to me.
Will you help me find my Stufful along\nRoute 10?
Sure
I’m too busy
I’ve got [VAR NUM1(0000)] Stufful lost out there somewhere.\nMaybe they’re hiding?
...Oh, I see.\nSympathy is a real rare commodity these days.
*sniff sniff*
Grrrr!
The Stufful ran off in a hurry...
Hmm...\c\nWell, [VAR NUM1(0001)] of them have come back so far...\c\nBut where [VAR NUMBRNCH(0002,0D0B)]is the lastare the other [VAR NUM1(0002)] still hiding?
Oh! You, child!\c\nAll of my Stufful have made it back, thanks\nto you!
You’ve been a great help to me here.\nI surely do owe you, my young friend.\c\nHave this Muscle Band from me, as a token\nof my appreciation.
Cute and strong and just a little bit wild...\c\nThat’s what a Pokémon should be like!\nAnd that’s why Stufful is the best.
Glistening sweat! Slippery goo!\nThe perfect tune that keeps Hano Beach going!\r\nPyukumuku chuckers are desperately needed!\r\nWon’t you become a Pyukumuku chucker?
What’s that?
I’m too busy
Now that’s a shame!\nThe job pays pretty good, you know!
I’m one of the staff members responsible for\nkeeping Hano Beach spotless for our guests.\c\nBut Pyukumuku sometimes wriggle up on our\nbeach from the sea.\c\nI don’t know why they do it, but we can’t just\nleave them there.\c\nThey shrivel up on land and that’s not all...\nOur guests get grossed out seeing them and\r\nsometimes even get hurt stepping on them!
So we end up with no choice but to chuck\nthose poor Pyukumuku back into the sea!\c\nI’ll explain the job to you. It’s pretty easy.\c\nStep one! Catch Pyukumuku!\c\nStep two! Throw the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea!\c\nStep three! Report back to me once every last\nPyukumuku on the beach is returned to the sea!
So what do you say? Think you’ve got what it\ntakes to be a Pyukumuku chucker?
Sure, I do
I’m too busy
Then get every last Pyukumuku on this beach\ndiving right back into the sea!\c\nLet’s see... I can still see [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pyukumuku left on\nthe sand and in need of saving!
We really need some more hands to get this job\ntaken care of. Come back if you ever have time!
Puke?
Muke...
You chucked the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea...
Hey there, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve gotten [VAR NUM1(0001)] Pyukumuku safely back into\nthe sea so far.\c\nWhich means that you’ve still got [VAR NUM1(0002)] more to\nreturn to the sea!
Good job, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve got every last Pyukumuku that was\nstranded on the beach back into the sea!\c\nNow they are safe back where they should be,\nand the beach is safe for our guests.
You’re a real good worker, you know?\nYou have a real knack for Pyukumuku chucking.\c\nAnd I’ve got your pay ready for you right here.\nTake it! You’ve earned it!
Pyukumuku are one of the most famous of all\nthe Alolan Pokémon.\c\nBut a lot of tourists from other regions don’t\nunderstand their appeal. It’s a real shame.
But no matter how many times we toss them\nback into the sea, they come wriggling back up\r\nthe next morning like clockwork.\c\nFeel free to come back and help again whenever\nyou have some spare time!
It looks like all of the Stufful have gone back\nto their Trainer...
It looks like all the Pyukumuku are gone from\nthe beach...
Back for another day working as a Pyukumuku\nchucker? I wish I could help you out with that...\c\nBut I’m so worried about that Pyukumuku that’s\nlooking downhearted that I can’t focus on work...

Thank you for joining us, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker has already set out to gather more\ninformation about the UB.\c\nI have been waiting here on standby.\nI expect we will have another visitor soon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
A visitor?
Who?
A mysterious person who claims to have some\nknowledge of the UB.\c\nHe insisted that he would not share any more\ndetails with me until we met in person...\c\nBut if he does have any real insight into the UB,\nthen we cannot let this opportunity pass us by.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So I think it is best if you and I wait to take any\nfurther action now. And that we trust Mr. Looker\r\nto handle the fieldwork.\c\nThough I do feel bad asking him to do all the\nwork for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I must applaud Mr. Looker for that remarkable\nenergy of his.\c\nHe is in a class of his own, even within the\nelite members of the International Police...\c\nI would never have expected someone like him\nto serve under my command...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Don’t mind if I let myself in.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Y-you are...?[VAR 0114(0029)]
How you been doing? You’re well?[VAR 0114(000A)]
M-Mr. Nanu...\nMy, it really has been a long time...\c\nbut why in the world are you—?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m your contact.\nYou want to know about that monster, right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Monster...\c\nSo you were the one who reached out to us?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I forgot about this kahuna meeting we were all\nsupposed to go to.\r\nThat’s how I ended up stuck as the messenger.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And here you are, boy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And here you are, girl.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You’re acquainted with [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Guess you could say that.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And...do you have some information for us about\nthe UB that has been sighted on the island?[VAR 0114(0029)]
It’s not like I’ve seen it or anything.\nJust heard rumors. You know.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes. So then...could I trouble you to tell us what\nit is that you do know?[VAR 0114(0029)]
What was it you guys were calling it?\nAbsorption or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Melemele Meadow.\nNot just one of ’em either. Two of the suckers.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What was it you guys were calling it?\nBeauty or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Verdant Cavern.\nNot just one of ’em either. Four of the things.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wait... Wait just a moment!\c\nHow do you know our code names?\nThat is highly classified information![VAR 0114(0029)]
Hmph. No one wants to hear about that.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Nanu was in fact a superior of mine when\nI first joined the International Police...\c\nI never dreamed that I would meet him once\nagain under circumstances such as these...[VAR 0114(0029)]
But if the information that he shared with us is\ncorrect, then there are multiple UBs this time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The situation is dangerous.\nIf we don’t act at once...[VAR 0114(0029)]
¡Es un desastre![VAR 0114(001F)]
M-Mr. Looker...\nIn English, if you would...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! But please!\nThis is no time to care about my odd habits!\c\nThe UB sightings! I’ve gotten a hot tip!\c\nThe perp really is right here on Melemele![VAR 0114(001F)]
It appears that it might be UB Absorption!\c\nIt seems to be a UB of great strength and\nformidable muscles!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one creature, but two!\r\nIn Melemele Meadow![VAR 0114(001F)]
It appears that it might be UB Beauty!\c\nIt seems to be a beautiful yet dangerous UB\nthat can move at incredible speeds!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one specimen, but four!\r\nIn Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(001F)]
So it appears that his information was correct...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hm? What’s that?\nDid you say something just now, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
No... It’s nothing.\c\nI understand, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and act as our\nbackup once again, in case we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hold it right there!\nNot again! This time I insist that I...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Please understand, Mr. Looker.\c\nYou do not have a partner Pokémon with you.\c\nI cannot allow you to operate in a place where\nyou are likely to encounter danger![VAR 0114(0029)]
And besides that...having such an experienced\nveteran as yourself serve as our backup is a\r\nvital task in an operation like this one.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Understood, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I must be off.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
You take these, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI received them from Madam Wicke.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I trust that you will be careful out there, my\nyoung [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAnd one last thing before you go...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on Nihilego, AKA UB Symbiont.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nNow it is time we get to work.\nAnd I’m here if you need to ask me anything![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Absorption...\r\notherwise known as Buzzwole.[VAR 0114(0029)]
With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Beauty...\r\notherwise known as Pheromosa.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ugh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s the matter, Chief?![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m fine... I’m fine.\c\nThere were just so many of them this time that\nI was nearly run off my feet...[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
What? I’m fine, really!\nPlease don’t stare at me like that![VAR 0114(0029)]
Y-yes. Of course, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
You two must also be tired.\nWhat shall we do now?[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you are terribly exhausted, there is only one\nnatural conclusion to make...[VAR 0114(001F)]
The one thing that takes away all weariness!\nIt is, of course, a feast!\c\nThis time, indeed, we must have a great feast\nto celebrate our successful mission!\c\nAnd there is a restaurant here on this island\nwhere we can eat to our stomach’s content!\r\nI speak of course of the Battle Buffet![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? How curious. How is it that you are once\nagain so familiar with the local restaurants?[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ...\c\nI-it’s just by chance! The chanciest of chances!\nNot the Chansey-est, mind you. Just chance!\c\nN-never you mind that! The most important fact\nright now is that it is a very popular place!\r\nI will go at once to make a reservation![VAR 0114(001F)]
Mr. Looker is simply hopeless, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0029)]
And Mr. Nanu...\c\nhe was an excellent police officer years ago.\c\nHe was on par with Mr. Looker even...back then.\c\nI’m really only here in this position now because\nof him...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Es ist ein Desaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? Mr. Looker?\nBack so soon again?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Could it be...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, it could indeed! In fact it is, Chief!\c\nI’ve gotten a tip about another UB sighting!\c\nThis time it is on Akala Island!\nWe must delay our feast once again![VAR 0114(001F)]
Roger that, Mr. Looker.\c\nThen we must hurry to Akala Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
We will return to the motel that we formerly\nused as our base of operations on Akala.\c\nI hope you will join us there as soon as you are\nready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
Back to Akala!\nWe are still counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThe motel on Akala’s Route 8!\nThat is the place you must come![VAR 0114(001F)]

Oh! Here you are at last, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve already been able to gather all of the intel\nwe need about the UBs this time.\c\nSo the chief has already left to help secure the\nsite and protect the surrounding areas.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Hallo![VAR 0114(0012)]
This precocious young lady here was my\ninformant this time![VAR 0114(001F)]
They sent me here on an errand.\nSince I’m not busy doing trials or anything.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hmm?\nWho is that?[VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s a secret.\c\nOh, and I had one more order I was given.\nOr was it a request? Either way...[VAR 0114(0012)]
What might that be?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I was told I should have a real serious battle\nwith [VAR TRNAME(0000)] before I came back.\c\nI don’t really know why, but it seems like maybe\nit’s some sort of trial of strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So come on! Let’s have a battle!\nHave a Pokémon battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
Sure
Hold on
Shocking! You want me to wait?\nFine then. I guess I can wait.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Is that precocious young miss powerful?[VAR 0114(001F)]
All right!\nThen let’s get going already!\c\nTime for Mina to show you her full power!\nWe’ll get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
Whoa, you’re surprisingly strong!\c\nThen it’s no problem.\nTurns out, you’re strong enough,\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
It seems that my precocious young miss here is\nnot to be trifled with either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
OK, I’m out of here![VAR 0114(0012)]
She is rather odd, isn’t she?\nA real individual spirit...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But now we should get our heads on straight\nand get to work!\c\nI do not like it, but I am in charge of backup\nonce again![VAR 0114(001F)]
And for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nThe Beast Balls you will need for this mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWe should unravel the mysteries of Xurkitree,\nalso known as UB Lighting.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ngh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Are you all right, ma’am?![VAR 0114(001F)]
Y...yes...\nI’m fine, Mr. Looker.\c\nI just felt a passing vertigo...but I’m fine.\nPlease do not worry yourself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I must! I insist on worrying!\c\nYou have always had the stamina of a\nMachamp, Chief! I cannot believe this is nothing![VAR 0114(001F)]
No, please... It is nothing so serious...\c\nI’m sorry for causing you to worry about me.\nI insist that I really am fine...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Putting all that aside, I must say that we have\nfound a great ally in [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nWhat a fantastic Trainer...\c\nIt was all that I could do to simply keep that\nXurkitree away from the town...[VAR 0114(0029)]
The UBs seem to get terribly aggressive when\nthey spot me...\c\nIt’s like they are treating me as prey or an\nenemy...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I am sure it is only your imagination, Chief!\nYou must be exhausted![VAR 0114(001F)]
[~ 31]
[~ 32]
...I let myself in.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Nanu...[VAR 0114(0029)]
You been keeping well?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Y-y-you are...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Heh. So it’s you, 100kr.\nOr...\r\nSorry. What is it now? “Looker”?[VAR 0114(000A)]
...Yes. It is.[VAR 0114(001F)]
What’s this? No smile for me?\c\nHere I am, coming out of my way to bring you\nthe info about the UB that you’re searching for.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you really?[VAR 0114(0029)]
That monster you’re calling Blade...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That monster you’re calling Blaster...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And your information...\nIt is all true?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m the kahuna of Ula’ula Island.\c\nIf you don’t do something about that monster\nfor me, our guardian’s not gonna be happy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thank you...for the information, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
See you around then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Mr. Looker?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes...yes, ma’am?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Mr. Looker... Do I take it that you are acquainted\nwith Mr. Nanu?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I knew him once. I thought.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Never mind that...\nRight now we need to focus on our mission.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Of course... Yes, of course you’re right.\c\nIf we have reports of a new UB sighting, then\nour mission is our first priority...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I will move to Ula’ula island and prepare our\nnew base in the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you are ready,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
I will go to Ula’ula...\nI trust that you will, as well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nThe motel on Ula’ula Island is on Route 13...[VAR 0114(001F)]

I’ve been waiting for you...[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
Once again we have already gathered the intel\non the UB we are targeting.\c\nMr. Nanu provided us with everything that we\nneeded to know.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blade...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that is apparently able\nto cut through anything at all...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blaster...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that apparently\npossesses a fearsome energy that will\r\nburn anything...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
We cannot afford any delays.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I will protect the populated areas as usual.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] will go to the site.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker, you will stand by.\nWe will ask you to handle backup.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ngh![VAR 0114(0029)]
Are you all right, Chief?\nI think you are pushing yourself too far...[VAR 0114(001F)]
If you would agree, I would be happy to go into\nthe field myself this time and...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m fine!\nI can still handle this!\c\nI have you to watch my back after all, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0029)]
...Yes, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I will be off now.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
Do not push yourself too hard, Chief.\nPlease...be careful.[VAR 0114(001F)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], these are for you.\nYour Poké Balls known as Beast Balls for\r\nthis mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Kartana, also known as UB Blade.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Celesteela, also known as UB Blaster.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And...we have also had word from HQ.\c\nThere is only one UB left for us to take care of.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And we had our hands full with so many\nindividuals for this last UB...\c\nIt was a rather dangerous situation.\nBut you were all right, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yes, of course!\nBoth me and my Pokémon were fine!\c\nOf course we ran into some difficult situations...\nBeing surrounded by the UBs and outflanked by\r\nthem made it rather touch and go for a while...[VAR 0114(0029)]
As I’d feared...[VAR 0114(001F)]
What is it, Mr. Looker?\c\nYou have been acting rather odd for a while\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah... No... It’s nothing.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Could it be...\c\nCould it be about our long-delayed feast?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh...\c\nYes! Yes, indeed! What a disaster that you\nhave found me out!\c\nThe truth is that I am starving, just starving!\nHow a Snorlax feels, I know exactly now![VAR 0114(001F)]
Hee... How hopeless you are, Mr. Looker.\c\nBut I suppose we have been putting it off for\nrather a long time. You must be hungry indeed.\c\nThen allow me to take point this time and find\na delicious restaurant for us all. ♪[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah... Yes, ma’am! Thank you, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’m actually\nquite famished myself!\c\nSo you two stay here and relax while I go and\nfind us a place to eat![VAR 0114(0029)]
The chief can’t take much more of this...\nShe must be exhausted.\c\nShe acts particularly cheery when she is feeling\nunwell to hide her weakness from others.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I know it may be a bit late for this...\nBut there is something I would like to tell you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It is something that happened about 10 years\nago now...\c\nI came to the Alola region at that time as part of\na three-person team to eradicate a UB...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Of course we did not know them as UBs back\nthen. It was simply a dangerous creature.\c\nMy team succeeded in chasing down the UB.\nAnd then we tried to put an end to it...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But somebody screwed up.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Nanu...[VAR 0114(001F)]
This halfhearted fool here felt sorry for the\nmonster, even if only for a moment.\c\nThat moment was enough to get the third\nmember of our team done in by the UB.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This I cannot deny...\nI made an error of judgment.\c\nI failed to consider the fact that she was not\ntrained for combat...[VAR 0114(001F)]
She was just bait for the UB...[VAR 0114(000A)]
And the International Police knew it...\c\nThe UBs relentlessly seek out those who have\npassed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nThe passage must change them somehow...as\nthough they’ve been bathed in some energy...\r\nSomething that the beasts can smell or sense...\c\nIt is thought that the UBs can track such\npeople as though sniffing them out.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s not like the monsters come here by choice.\nThey don’t want to be here.\c\nSo they smell that familiar scent and think\nthere’ll be a wormhole. That they’ll get home.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Nanu, you called her bait...\nShe really was, wasn’t she?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Faller...[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is what the International Police calls them.\nHumans who appear from an Ultra Wormhole...\c\nand those who are bathed in a great deal of\nthe energy that pours out from them.\c\nShe had come through a wormhole.\nShe was from another world.\c\nAnd she was put on our team to help draw\nthe UB to us...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, boy. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, girl. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes...\nIt’s true. [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe passed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] was exposed to the energy,\nso [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she may indeed be a Faller.\c\nBut...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m back...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nBut let us continue this talk another time.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m sorry, you two...\nI couldn’t get a reservation at the restaurant...\c\nIt seems like it’s a very popular place...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hey, missy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Nanu...\nI didn’t realize you were here.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Another one of those monsters appeared.\nThis time on Poni Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there. We’ll meet\nat the floating restaurant in Seafolk Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This next one seems like a real tough opponent.\nBe sure you’re ready for it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
O-oh... Yes, of course we will.\nThank you again, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Um...Mr. Looker?\nIs everything all right?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Of course... It is fine...\nNot a problem at all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I will make my way to the floating\nrestaurant at Poni Island.\c\nOnce you are ready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], please do\ncome and join us there.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So it is on to Poni next...\nI will be counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nLet us meet again at the floating restaurant in\nSeafolk Village...[VAR 0114(001F)]

So you came...young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
The chief has already left to set up protection\naround the populated areas...[VAR 0114(001F)]
You sent her off to the wrong location?[VAR 0114(000A)]
What choice did I have?\nShe is reaching her limit.\c\nWe have to force her to stand by to regain\nher strength...[VAR 0114(001F)]
So now we can finish our little talk.\nYou’ve got one Faller right here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
and the other one is Anabel.\nThough I don’t think she knows it herself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Nanu and I, we found her here ten years ago, \nunconscious on the shore of this very island.\c\nWe’d just finished our mission here.[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
She had lost most of her memories, but four\nthings she could tell us.\c\nThat her name was Anabel...\nThat she came from the Hoenn region...\r\nThat she had protected some tower there...\r\nAnd that she was a powerful Trainer...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Then she was placed under observation by\nthe International Police.\c\nAll because they detected an insane amount of\nUltra Wormhole energy from her.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It may be that she was wandering lost in the\nwormhole for some time...\c\nRegardless of that, she then entered the\nInternational Police herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And then got promoted right up past you, her\nsenior, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gotta hand it to the International Police.\nThey really are terrible.\c\nUsing the same strategy and setting up another\nFaller, even though the same thing failed before.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Your assumptions, you are half right in.\c\nHowever...this mission, she chose herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Perhaps something in her laments, whether she\nis conscious of it or not...\c\nPerhaps she feels some grief over the fate of\nthe UB, which came to this world just as\r\nshe did.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But she is still a Faller.\nIt is her fate to be targeted by the UBs.\c\nWith a Faller right before them, the UBs will run\nwild with excitement.\c\nNo matter how good she might be, everyone\nhas their limits.\c\nThat is why I had hoped to distract the UBs—\nto divert some of their attention.[VAR 0114(001F)]
That is why I asked you to help with the\ncatching of the UBs...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But you’re out of luck now.\c\nWith Anabel in that condition...\nShe’ll be done for if she runs into any UBs now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hm...\c\nYes, and I imagine that the false lead I sent her\nout on will not buy us much more time...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But before we’re out of time, boy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But before we’re out of time, girl...[VAR 0114(000A)]
How about a battle with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
No problem
Why?
Why not?\c\nIf you’ve got some preparation you need to do,\nthen I’ll wait here for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Maybe you already know this, but that guy is a\nreal tough opponent when he’s being serious.[VAR 0114(001F)]
What a good little boy you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
What a good little girl you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Then let’s go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’ll do, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.\nI think that’ll do fine.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Don’t let me down.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I won’t...000.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Well then, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nIt is our time to get down to work, is it not?\c\nOur final UB. Code name: Glutton...\c\nNanu said he would lead it deep into the heart\nof Resolution Cave...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Here you are. As usual.[VAR 0114(001F)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThis is your final assignment!\c\nBut first, my young friend...let us get the regular\nreports out of the way.\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nthen you should speak with Madam Wicke in\r\nthe Aether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nNow we will be able to learn all there is to know\nabout Guzzlord, otherwise known as UB Glutton.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We’ve done it, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yes...\c\nwe have successfully contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you so much for all of your hard work\non these missions, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0029)]
And Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Not at all!\nAll I did was provide backup to the two of you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It was all you and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now that we have finally completed our\nmissions, I will treat us all to a feast of—[VAR 0114(001F)]
One moment please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Wh-what is it, Chief?\c\nWe have finally reached it—our grand finale!\nWhich we should end with a big feast...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Our truly final mission requires that we go to\nAether Paradise and report to Ms. Wicke that\r\nwe have contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh! Indeed you are right!\nAnd we must thank her for the Poké Balls\r\nknown as Beast Balls![VAR 0114(001F)]
We will be going to Aether Paradise to report to\nMs. Wicke about our success.\c\nIf you are free, why don’t you come along as\nwell, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
We make for the secret labs in the lower floor\nof Aether Paradise!\c\nWhy don’t you join us, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001F)]

We have been waiting for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’d like to thank you first for all of your hard\nwork containing the UBs.\c\nOn behalf of the entire foundation, I would like\nto offer you our most sincere thanks.\c\nWith this, all the UBs that appeared from the\nUltra Wormhole, which opened in the earlier\r\nincident, have been caught.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh no, we’re the ones who should be thanking\nyou, I think...\c\nWe could not have done it without the use of\nthe Beast Balls that you provided for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
They are negative assets of the foundation...\nI am happy to see them put to some good use.\r\nI hardly know how I can thank the two of you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
The three of us
Don’t forget Looker
Yes, Mr. Looker also did a great deal to help us\nwith this mission.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I thought that he left before us.\nWhat is taking him so long to get here?\c\nI know that I told him that we would meet here.\nCould something have happened?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Taihen da![VAR 0114(001F)]
R-really, Mr. Looker!\nEven after all this time...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry!\nI know it’s a terrible habit, but I can’t help it!\r\nAnd more importantly...it’s a disaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
I would imagine it must be.\nWhat happened that made you so late?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I was on the way here when I stopped by\nMelemele Island to get some of their famous\r\nand delicious malasada as a gift for you all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But just when I had finished my purchase,\nI chanced to look up at the sky and there...[VAR 0114(001F)]
there it was![VAR 0114(001F)]
A mysterious black...something was zipping\nacross the bright blue sky over Alola![VAR 0114(001F)]
It was black and yet it was shining somehow!\nIt was...it was like it was refracting light![VAR 0114(001F)]
It might have been a UB!\nNo, I’m certain of it! It surely was a UB![VAR 0114(001F)]
But it couldn’t be...\nWe haven’t had any word from HQ about there\r\nbeing more UBs![VAR 0114(0029)]
Please rest easy.\nI do not think it was a UB.\c\nWe have a hundred of our foundation members\nworking in parallel with the International Police\r\ninvestigation and scouring Alola for UBs.\c\nWe have not detected any UBs other than\nthe ones that you already contained for us.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So you see?\nWe should be quite safe now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I suppose...\c\nPerhaps I was just dazzled by the brilliant,\nshining sky that stretches over Alola...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And it is little wonder if you were dazzled.\nYou all have been working so very hard.\c\nYou must be very tired, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0016)]
W-well...yes, I suppose I could do with a nice\nlittle break...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now you can have it.\c\nI received a message from HQ saying that our\npaid leave has been approved.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Paid leave?! You mean...actual vacation time?![VAR 0114(001F)]
They say we are free to do whatever we would\nlike until we get our next orders from HQ.\c\nI hope you will also use this chance to relax\nfor a little while, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I think that I will stay here and have a good\nlook around the Alola region.\c\nNot for work this time, but just as a regular\ntourist doing some sightseeing.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then I think that I will go and eat my fill of\ndelicious Alolan cooking!\c\nThere are simply too many restaurants and\neateries that I wish to visit!\c\nAnd the traditional dishes at Sushi High Roller\nare absolutely sublime![VAR 0114(001F)]
Sushi...High Roller?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh no! I completely forgot!\nI was supposed to be meeting someone![VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s this?! A date?![VAR 0114(001F)]
N-no! Not a date!\nI am meeting with Mr. Nanu!\c\nWe owe him quite a bit for all his help![VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes...I suppose we do.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So if you will excuse me...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], everyone...\r\nI’m afraid I must be going.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I really do thank you all.\nI hope we will all meet again someday![VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, my young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI also owe you my thanks.\c\nIt was because of your efforts that we were\nable to keep the chief safe until the end.\c\nThe folks at HQ thought that you needed to be\npaid for your work, so they sent this. Take it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now...I think that it’s time I went.\c\nI’ll be staying at the motel on Melemele Island,\nthough, so feel free to stop by anytime.[VAR 0114(001F)]

Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!
I know! Look at you!\nYou look like a Pokémon Trainer with sense!
I’ve got something I’d like to ask a promising-\nlooking Trainer like you!
What do you say?
I’m listening
I’d rather not...
Hmm... Hrmmmmmmm...\nWell, that is a real shame...
Oh! Oh, thank you!\nThat’s wonderfully kind of you!
You see, I’m here doing some research on\nvarious Pokémon.\c\nI need to record the differences between 10\nspecies of Pokémon for my survey sample,\r\nbut I’ve been working so hard and my back is\r\njust killing me...
But then you came along!\c\nYou look like a sensible young Trainer, which\nis just the sort of person I need to help me!\c\nI’d like to ask you to catch 10 different species\nof Pokémon for me.\r\nIt’s not too much to ask, right?
Oh! But—! Oh, look at you! Already?!\c\nYou’ve already caught more than 10 species of\nPokémon! Then show me!
Oh, yes. This is perfect!\nThis is all the data that I needed. Thank you!
Here. Why don’t you take this?\nAs a little thank-you for helping me out.
I’m really grateful for your assistance, my\nsensible young Trainer!\c\nI look forward to seeing what a promising young\ngo-getter like yourself gets up to!
Good luck out there!
I want you to catch 10 different species of\nPokémon for me.\r\nAny kind that you like. Just 10 different ones!

You there!\nDo you know of the Pokémon called Genesect?[VAR 0114(002B)]

I don’t
Then I have no choice but to admit that you are\nall I would expect you to be![VAR 0114(002B)]
Then allow me to inform you![VAR 0114(002B)]
Genesect is a Pokémon that lived 300 million\nyears ago.\c\nThen an organization called Team Plasma\nmodified it, attaching a cannon to its back.[VAR 0114(002B)]
The cannon’s abilities could be activated using\ncertain drives created by the scientists in the\r\nP2 Laboratory.\c\nI think that you might be able to use them as\nthey should be used.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Simply believing in your Pokémon will not\nguarantee that you can do everything you want.\c\nBut there are many things that are guaranteed\nto fail if you do not believe in them.\c\nIt is the trust between a Trainer and a Pokémon\nalone that can overcome those hurdles![VAR 0114(002B)]
You there!\nYou should know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree.\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of Trainers\nand Pokémon I can encounter there![VAR 0114(002B)]
You there!\nYou know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree, don’t you?\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of battles\nyou might have there![VAR 0114(002B)]

What in the world is the secret of the pond in\nthis garden?
Oh! Listen to this! I’ve finally figured out the\nsecret of the pond in this garden!\c\nIf you could see this whole garden from above,\nthe pond here would look like a Pokémon!\c\nHow about I give you a little quiz?\nWhat kind of Pokémon does this pond look like?
Yungoos
Spinda
Pikachu
Crabrawler
Wingull
Mareanie
Gyarados
Pyukumuku
Sharpedo
I don’t know
Don’t just say you don’t know and give up!\nWhy don’t you try walking around the pond?
No way! You’re way off...\nWhy don’t you go have a good look at the pond?
Bingo! That’s it!\nGive the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl a prize!\c\nYou got the right answer! The pond in this\ngarden is totally shaped like a Gyarados!\r\nAnd to reward you...I’ll give you something nice!
And that’s the end of our quiz!\nGone as quick as an Air Balloon pops!\c\nMaybe I shouldn’t have made it a multiple-\nchoice quiz, after all. It was way too easy!
I wonder if whoever designed this garden really\nloved Gyarados or something?\r\nMaybe there’s some really deep meaning to it!

Ow! Arghhh!\c\nI’ve got dust in my eyes! Dust in my everywhere!\nEven my Pokémon are rubbing their eyes!
I’ve been getting so much dust in my eyes in\nthis awful desert, you know?\c\nAnd my Pokémon have been rubbing their\neyes a lot, too...\c\nHow are your Pokémon doing?\nAre their eyes holding up in this mess?
They’re burning brightly
They’re sniffling all the time
They’re looking pretty bleary
Well, that sounds like they might not be getting\nenough sleep. Warm them up and let them rest.
Wouldn’t that be their noses, not their eyes?\nIf they’ve got snot running down their faces,\r\nbe a good Trainer and wipe it away for them!
Well, that doesn’t sound good!\nI’ll give you these, so put ’em on your Pokémon.
This Haina Desert, though... It’s a beast.\nI’ve been wandering lost through it for...\r\nWell, I guess it’s been about a year now.\c\nWhen am I ever going to get out of here?
Ow! Arghhh!\c\nMore dust in my eyes! What I wouldn’t give for\na pair of Go-Goggles right about now...

This may be a bit sudden, coming from me,\nbut I’d like you to have these.
They are all items related to Pokémon that\nMadam Lusamine hoped to meet someday...
If you like, I can tell you what any of them does.
DNA Splicers
Prison Bottle
Soul Dew
No need
Ah, the DNA Splicers...\c\nThey are said to be able to fuse a Pokémon\ncalled Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom.
Yes, the Prison Bottle...\c\nApparently it allows a Pokémon called Hoopa\nto change its appearance.
Yes, Soul Dew...\c\nIf the Pokémon Latios or Latias holds it, the\npower of their Psychic- and Dragon-type moves\r\nwill both go up by 20%.
You can also view the explanations for any\nof the items by checking them out in your Bag.
But you know...\neven if it comes from the desire to keep all of\r\nyour beloved Pokémon beside you always...\c\nusing Pokémon moves to put them into a\ncryogenic sleep is too much.
The Pokémon who sleep now...\c\nI will keep them safe so that they can someday\nreturn to their previous state...

It’s about time for them to start appearing...
Tally-ho!\nHey, friend! Isn’t this beach just the best?\c\nThat’s what you’d think, right?
But you’d be dead wrong if you did!\nThis beach has a dark secret behind it...\c\nDo you know this beach’s true form?\nThe one it takes on in the dark of night?
Hah! So you do know!\c\nYou can’t really know this beach if you only\nsee it during the day. Oh no, you can’t!
We make sure that people can enjoy the beach!\nAnd that Pokémon can live in peace!\c\nAnd you can help us do both at once, with one\nfantastic part-time job! What do you say?
Fine, fine. I won’t force you or anything.\nI can try to keep chucking ’em all myself...
Oh! Thanks a mil’, pal!\nThis job really wears a person out, you know?\c\nCan you wait around here until they start\nappearing? Should be any moment now...
You see? They gather quick as anything and\nbury themselves in the sand of the beach.\c\nIf we leave them like that, the tourists end up\nstepping on them as they flock to the beach.\c\nSo every night we chuck ’em back into the sea\nso they get back home safe.
You watching? So the most important thing is\nthat you grab ’em good...
then spin around real good before letting go\nto chuck ’em right back into the sea!
Kinda like the hammer throw, you know?\nDo your best!
Chuck all the Pyukumuku that’re on the beach\nback into the sea!\c\nI’ll reward you for your hard work if you do!
Now they won’t have to get all dried out on\nthe beach. Mm-hmm!\c\nWe do this every night, so come back again\nanytime you want to help!
Phew... I’m beat!\c\nChucking all these Pyukumuku by myself is\nenough to leave me dizzy!
Pyuk! Pyuku!
You spun around 10 times and then flung the\nPyukumuku back into the sea!
Looks like that last one you chucked really was\nthe last one on the beach.
Thanks, friend!\c\nChucking all these critters by myself leaves me\ndizzy as I can take!\c\nAnd here’s your reward for helping.
Once they’ve come to like a place, those\nPyukumuku will just keep on coming back to it.\c\nSo we end up having to do this every single\nnight. Come help again anytime you feel like it!
You gonna give up without finishing the job?

Hurry! You’ve got to find it!\nOh my precious little Rocky!!!
I’ve never even heard of a Rockruff getting lost!\c\nEveryone says that they’re clever enough to\nsniff out their Trainers and return to them...
That’s why I’ve been saying that he was\nkidnapped! Pokénapped! Whatever!\c\nI was just a little distracted while shopping...\nand someone must have taken advantage of\r\nthat moment to steal my little Rocky!\c\nIt is simply too adorable! That’s why!\nIt must have been stolen from me by someone!
Well, I wouldn’t say it MUST be that...\nThere could’ve been an accident...\r\nor it could be lost or could have run away...
Ex-CUSE me?!\c\nRun away?! My little Rocky?!\nNever in a million years!!!
Well, it certainly is missing.\nWe don’t refute that.\c\nSo the question is what to do next...
Pardon the intrusion. Captain Ilima here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wuff!
Oh! Captain Ilima! How good of up you stop by.\nDid you need something from Hau’oli’s finest?
It seems this adorable little Pokémon is looking\nfor its Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Is it indeed! I see!\nThen this must be...
Wuff!
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!\nROCKY!!!
Wuuuffffff!!
Allow Captain Ilima to explain.\c\nI found this little bundle of fur waiting for\nsomeone outside the apparel shop for ages.[VAR 0114(000C)]
...Y-you did?\c\nWell, yes, I suppose I did tell Rocky to wait\noutside the shop so that I could focus on my\r\nshopping and trying on outfits...\c\nand then four hours passed before I knew it.\nI’d completely forgotten about poor Rocky...
...\c\nMa’am...
Sounds like you had a tough day, Rockruff.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Wuff!
I-I’m so sorry, Rocky!\nI did it again, didn’t I! I’m a terrible mother!
Wuff!!
I’m so sorry for troubling you all!\nI made all this fuss and it’s all my fault!\c\nPlease, I want you to accept this.\nI hope this whole thing can be our little secret.
W-well, that takes care of that!\nI think I will absent myself now!
Come, Rocky!\c\nI’m going to fix you a veritable feast as my\napology for forgetting about you yet again.
Wuuuff!
Looks like that Pokémon’s got more sense in\nits head than its Trainer has in hers.
There are all kinds of Trainers, just as there\nare all kinds of Pokémon.\c\nI’ll just see myself out now.\nGood seeing you, [VAR PKNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Most of my work comes down to finding lost\nkids or Pokémon, or helping lost tourists.\c\nThe only thing we never seem to lose in Alola\nis the peace and quiet! Same goes for today!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 581
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All right! I’d say we’re about done, yeah?\nLet’s call it a day and get on home.
Griiime...
Hey! What are you doing out here, kid?!\nThis is a restricted area! We’re working here!
Seriously, boy? Aren’t you a Malie native?\nWe are famous for our hospitality! Tch!\c\nAnd kids need to explore and see the world.\nHow else are they gonna learn? I swear...
Y-yes, Fath—er...I mean...sir! Yes, sir!\c\nIf that’s what you really want...then I will tell this\nrandom trespasser about what it is we do here.
This is where we take care of all of the garbage\nproduced in the Alola region, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady.\c\nWe Janitors work together with our Pokémon\ntoward this goal, in fact.\c\nThe garbage that the human workers gather is\nconsumed by Muk and Grimer, like this one here.\c\nOur president here beside me has a Muk that\ncan eat 10 tons of rubbish in a single day!
Though, me and Grimer here are still just\ntemporary contract workers...
...But isn’t that an island challenge amulet you\nhave there?
I took on the trials myself, when I was a kid!\c\nThough...it was a bit too much for me, and so I\nactually ended up giving up right away...
Look here, kid.\c\nSeems to me that my Muk’s had a bit too much\nto eat today...
How about you join me in a battle and provide it\nwith a bit of exercise to aid the ol’ digestion?
I’d be happy to
Not right now
What, you got other plans or something?\nLet me know if you change your mind.
Good! You’ve got chutzpah, my friend!\nThen let’s get this thing happening!
Heh! Not too shabby...just like I’d figured!\nYou’ve got something in you, kid.
Amazing... You even beat my fa—\c\nI mean, my boss’s Muk...
What’re you doing standing there like a lump?!\nYou’re up next, you useless dullard!
Wh-what?! Me... Me and Grimer?!\nThere’s no way we could win against this kid!
You see! It’s just like you did with your trials\nwhen you were a kid!\c\nThe moment something starts to look tough,\nyou give a cry and off you run! You give up!\r\nAnd you’re supposed to be my son!\c\nHow can I leave this plant to you if you never\nlearn the value of a bit of hard work?\c\nI can’t ever leave things in your hands if you\ndon’t give me reason to trust you can handle it!
F-Father...
... ... ...\c\nFine! We’ll do it!
I will not run away anymore!\nI will give this everything that I’ve got!
Then I’ll take you on
Give me a minute
I’m counting on you, kid. Help me out here.
I am a man now!\c\nJust you watch, Father!\nI mean, sir!
Blast it all!
You...
I...I’m sorry, Father...\nI really am...just a weakling...
You’re hired!
F-Father?
I’m not your father! I’m your boss!\nAnd I’m saying that you are hired, boy!\c\nFrom this day forth, I’m making you the head\nof the plant! And I won’t hear another word of\r\ncomplaint about it from you!
Wha—?
You saw that this Trainer was stronger than\nyou or even me...\c\nand still you and your Grimer went up against\nh[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer with everything that you had in you.\c\nThat’s what I’ve always wanted to see from you!\nThat kind of persistence and drive!\c\nAnd that’s why you and Grimer...\nThat’s why you’re going to take over for me.
Th-thank you, sir! Father, sir!\nI mean, Mr. Former President, sir!
Sorry for using you to teach my boy a lesson.\c\nBut when I saw that island challenge amulet\nyou had there, it just hit me, you know?\c\nTake this for your troubles.\nIt may be twisted, but it’s not garbage!
Now that I’ve got my successor sorted out,\nI can finally retire to a life of peace and quiet.\c\nI think I can trust my boy’s crew to keep\non eating up all of Alola’s garbage from now on!
Yes, sir! You can, sir!
You again, young trial-goer!\c\nThanks again for helping me set my son to\nrights before.
Me and my Grimer have been working really\nhard ever since then.\c\nYou do your best, too.\nI’ll be hoping you succeed in your own dreams!

Mallow, like, totally saved me.\nI wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her.\c\nShe got me this job when Team Skull fell apart\nand I had nowhere left to go.\c\nOh, but she didn’t want me to tell anyone about\nthat either ’cause she’s so modest. Huh.

Say, do your Pokémon know any moves that\ncan restore HP in battle?\c\nThere’s this move called Roost, you see...\c\nIf you’d like to know more about it, why don’t\nyou show me that you can defeat every Trainer\r\non Route 3 first.
So you’ve defeated all of the Trainers along\nRoute 3, have you?\c\nYou have shaken me from my calm repose!\nMy heart was a still water, but no longer!
I feel my heart trembling!\nSo you’ve come again!
Shall we start?\nLet’s have a soul-shaking battle!
I accept
I refuse
My soul is calm and unruffled.
That is a good reply.
I will stand before you as a Roost move user!
It was a fine battle.\c\nMy heart feels as light and clear as the blue\nsky that appears after a storm passes through.
This is proof of the battle between your team\nand my own.\c\nTake it, my strong friend!
You will likely find other Trainers like me on\nthe routes of Alola. Searching for strength.\c\nChallenging them together with your Pokémon\nwould not be a bad reason to take a journey. 
Hehehe...\nYou there!\c\nIn battle, the sky’s the limit! Are you ready to\nsend your opponent into the atmosphere?\c\nWhat do you say? Might you be interested in\nthe move Sky Drop?\c\nIf you are, beat every other Trainer on Route 8\nand we can talk.
You beat all of the Trainers along Route 8?\c\nThen it looks like it’s finally my time to shine!
What a wicked little Trainer you are for making\nme wait like that...
Now let’s get this thing started, shall we?
Yes, please!
No, wait!
If you make me wait too long then I’ll run out\nof power for my full-force attacks!
Then here I go!
It’s time for me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-Powered performance!
Well, that’s the end of me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-Powered performance!
Thanks for taking part in the show!\nTake this with you as a souvenir!
I bet you can find other Trainers who use\nparticular moves and items, just like me, on the\r\nvarious routes of Alola.\c\nWouldn’t it be fun to take a little detour and\nsearch them all out?
Looks like you’re a fellow Trainer who can use\nZ-Power in battle.\c\nLet’s find out whose full-force strength is the,\nuh, fullest!\c\nBeat all of the Trainers in this tunnel if you\nthink you can take me on!
Looks like you did what I asked and beat all of\nthe Trainers in this tunnel, huh?\c\nWell then, my Z-Powered challenger...\c\ndo you want to compare Z’s with me?\nWe’ll see whose Z is the best!
I’ve been waiting for you!\nTrainer who can wield the full force of Z-Power!
Then let us have a Z-battle to Z-prove who\nhas the best Z-Moves!
Let’s start
Hold on
Being cautious, are you?\nThen you must not have a lot of Z-Power!
That’s a good answer. But I hope you’re ready.\nMy Z-Power is not to be trifled with!
Our full-force Z-Power competition begins now!
Very well done! That is some real Z-Power!\nYour Z is the most Z of any Z!
Let me award you with this token to show how\nhighly I value and respect your Z!
There are probably other Z-Trainers like me out\nand about in Alola.\c\nIf you want to achieve the ultimate in Z, then\nsearch them out and challenge them all.
Dragon Tail is a move that’ll send an opponent\nflying in battle!\c\nDon’t you want to learn such a peerless move,\nthat no one can possibly stand against?\c\nIf you do, then beat every last Trainer on Route\n12 before you come talk to me again!
It appears you have completed your training\nand defeated Route 12’s other Trainers...\c\nThen I, the kahuna of Route 12, will honor you\nwith a battle!
I’ve been waiting for you.\nMy reckless little challenger.
I’ll show you the Z-Power of a Route 12 kahuna!
Let’s do it
I’m not ready...
And I was just getting warmed up, too!\nCome on, kid. Don’t make me wait too long...
Hee hee hee...\nSo you think you’re ready, do you?
This is the devastating Z-Power of the great\nkahuna of Route 12!
Rgh!\nI have been...done in...
I yield to you the title of Route 12 kahuna...\nand this as well...
I cannot allow myself to be satisfied with the\ntitle of kahuna in such a small area as this...\c\nI think it’s time that I start setting my goals\non the wider world as well!
Let me guess. You were wondering what a\nGolfer would be doing in a meadow like this.\c\nIf you want an answer to that question, then\ndefeat all of the Trainers in this meadow first.
Ho! Congratulations to you!\nYou’ve beat all the Trainers in the meadow!\c\nThen I’ll tell you why I am here...\c\nI am here waiting for a worthy Trainer like you!
Ho! So you’ve come again?\nI’ve been practicing my swing as I wait for you!
So what do you say?\nWill you have a Pokémon battle against me?
I will
No thanks
What, really?\nCome on! We should have a battle!
My special strategy hinges on my use of an\nitem called the Flame Orb!
This Golfer’s on fire!\nHere comes my full-powered best shot!
Mm-hmm. Just as I’d thought...\c\nYou have what it takes to be the next wielder\nof my precious Flame Orb...\c\nMm-hmm!\nI’m glad that I waited here for you so long.
Take it...my Flame Orb...
There! And that’s that!\c\nI don’t know if it’s simply a part of getting older,\nbut lately I’ve been completely hooked on golf.\c\nI’d gotten a bit burnt out as a Trainer and could\nno longer use that Flame Orb as I should have.\c\nUsing it wisely takes a bit of tricky thinking, but\nif you figure it out, it’ll pay you back in spades!
It takes a great deal of endurance and spirit\nto keep dancing without any pause. ♪\c\nIf you’d like to battle me, then you’ll have to\nshow that you have the endurance and spirit\r\nto rout all of the Trainers in the area first. ♪
Lovely. So you’ve defeated all the other Trainers\naround here, have you? ♪\c\nIt looks like you’ve got endurance and spirit. ♪
Oh, lovely. So you’ve come back to me! ♪
My Pokémon have plenty of endurance and\nspirit both. ♪\c\nEach also has a Focus Sash.\nWhat do you say? Will you try taking them on?
I’ll try
Not yet
Then be on your merry way. ♪\nI’ll be waiting here anytime. ♪
What a wonderful response! ♪\c\nI can’t wait to see just how long you’ll be able to\nstay on your feet against me and my team! ♪
Let’s find out which one of us really has the\nmost endurance and spirit, shall we? ♪
Oh, how lovely! ♪ Just lovely! ♪\c\nYou and your team really do have a great deal\nof endurance and spirit. ♪
But I’ll still give you this so that you can reach\neven higher levels of endurance and spirit. ♪
You use that and become a Trainer with most\nexcellent endurance and spirit! ♪
Oh! You’re the one from the great composition!\c\nI just did a hundred sketches, so now I’m taking\na break.\c\nI beat all the Trainers around here, too, so now\nI’m totally bored again...\r\nI wish there was someone to go all out against.\c\nThat’s it! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIf you can beat all the Trainers around here, too,\r\nI’ll give you a battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh! The one from the great composition!\c\nLooks like you’ve beaten everybody else in\nthis place, huh?\c\nThen have a battle against Captain Mina!\nLet’s get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
Hey, welcome back![VAR 0114(0012)]
I hope you’re ready for the extraordinary\nZ-Power of me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll take you on!
Not yet!
OK, I guess I’ll wait.\nI’ll wait ri-i-ight here. And not move an inch.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Then here I go!\nI’m going all out, big-time![VAR 0114(0012)]
Me and my team are all full-powered to the max![VAR 0114(0012)]
Hrmmm! Well, this is frustrating.\nI failed to really use my full power...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But it was a fun battle, so take this, big-time![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’d like to draw a picture of the way you\nlook when you’re battling, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLet’s have another full-power Pokémon battle\nagain sometime, yeah?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m one of the Trial Guides that’s here to help\nout young trial-goers on their island challenge.\c\nFeel like learning a mysterious move, maybe?\nIts effects change based on where you use it.\c\nLet’s see if you can beat all of the Trainers on\nRoute 5, for starters.
So you were able to beat everybody on Route 5\nat least, huh?\c\nThen I’ll give you a little trial of my own!
Hey, welcome back, friend.\nYou’re that trial-goer, aren’t you?
You think you’re ready to take on my little trial?\nI’ve got a Z-Power Ring myself, as you can see.
I’d be happy to
Please give me some time
Yeah, sure, no problem.\nI’ll be waiting here, so come back whenever.
I’d heard that the latest batch of trial-goers\nare a feisty lot. I’ve been looking forward to this!
This ol’ Trial Guide’s little trial is about to start!
That’s the end of my little trial!\nPhewee, you’ve got some solid skills, kid!
Yup, I’ve got to congratulate you on this win!\nHere’s a reward for clearing my little trial!
Seeing you young kids giving it your all like that...\c\nyou all shine as bright as the sun over Alola!\c\nThis may just be a volunteer position, but I’m\nsure glad that I decided to be a Trial Guide.
I’m one of the Trial Guides that are here to help\nyou kids out during your island challenge.\c\nBut the job that I was tasked with is actually\nto test how your skills are coming along.\c\nSo why don’t you show me you can beat every\nlast Trainer on Route 15? Then come back here.
Looks like you didn’t waste much time going\nthrough all the Trainers on Route 15!\c\nIf you’re that good, then I guess I’ll pull out my\nZ-Power, too.
Hey! Back again?\nHow’s it going, little trial-goer?
Think you can take on my little trial?
Yes, please
Not yet
You sure you’re up to this?\nPrepare real good before you come back.
I like your spirit, kid.\nI think I’m getting fired up, too!
Then the full-powered little trial of this Trial\nGuide is about to start!
Nice! You cleared my little trial.\nYou’re a real tough little trial-goer.
Here’s your reward from me.\nTake it and carry on with your adventure!
All the trial-goers I see out and about on their\nisland challenges have such great smiles...\c\nThey’re as beautiful as the brilliant moon that\nhangs in Alola’s night sky.\c\nThe work doesn’t pay a lick, but I can’t give it\nup when it lets me see those happy faces.
What? You want a little tête–à–tête with a\nZ-Power Ring user like yours truly?\c\nThen become the number two Trainer in all of\nPoni Plains, baby.
Looks like you managed to claw your way up\nto the number two spot in Poni Plains, huh?\c\nThen I guess you’ve earned a little rendezvous\nwith the number-one Trainer: me!
Hey, number two!\nYou planning to make me wait forever?
What do you say?\nIs it time for our little showdown?
Let’s battle!
Not yet!
OK...but I’m not going anywhere.\nThe number-one Trainer doesn’t run away.
You can’t just choose the cool-looking Pokémon\nand think you can win...
The full power of the number-one Trainer is\ngoing to finish you off for the day!
Oh, baby! I’ve gotta give you a hand!\nYou are worthy of being the next number one!
So here you go, babe.\nA little present from me!
There aren’t too many Trainers who’ve mastered\nusing their Z-Power Rings.\c\nSo don’t forget I’m one of those special few!\nPlease, baby!
Sorry, youngster, but I can’t fight you.\c\nMy Pokémon are like brothers to me.\nAnd they’re not interested in battling weaklings.\c\nIf you want me to ask them to fight against you,\nthen beat all the Trainers on Mount Hokulani.
Are you the one who defeated all the Trainers\non Mount Hokulani then?\c\nAll right then. Fair enough.\nI like kids with a bit of pep.
Made me wait, didn’t you?
I’ll be using my Z-Power against you.\nYou ready for a scuffle?
Sure I am
Not yet
Hmph. Fine, kid.
I think I feel something coming over me...
Sorry, kid, but my Pokémon don’t know the\nmeaning of the word “moderation”!
You...\nYou’ve got some good Pokémon, kid.
Thanks for showing my brothers a good time.\nHere’s your thanks.
You know, Z-Power is more or less the power\nof the pledge you’ve made to your Pokémon.\c\nAnd my relationship with my Pokémon is closer\nthan that of a parent or a brother or anything.

Miss Lusamine can be rather egotistical, I find.\nDon’t you think that someone like me, who\r\nalways has the foundation’s best interests in\r\nmind, would be more fitting for the position?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re right
You think so?
You are surprisingly intelligent for a child![VAR 0114(0015)]

So you came...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I guess I’ve got to thank you again for all you’ve\ndone for my family...\c\nEspecially...for Lillie.\c\nI never knew she could smile like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
My mother’s desires to reach Nihilego...\nand what she did in order to achieve that goal...\r\nI know she was completely out of control.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t understand it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It was my father who started it.\c\nHe was the one who first confirmed the\nexistence of Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But my father...\c\nHe disappeared during an experiment.\nTrying to connect to an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nAll that he left behind was a weakened Cosmog\nand his papers about Nihilego...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lusamine’s obsession with Ultra Wormholes...\nand her obsession with the Ultra Beasts...\c\nI think it was all basically her way of trying to\nreach him again.\r\nThat’s what I had to believe. To get through it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s not an apology or anything, but...\nI hope you’ll take this fellow.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 7]
And I’ll give you all the memory drives that let\nits Evolution, Silvally, change its type...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
This is a different Type: Null.\nNot the same one that I ran away with...\c\nIt was kept in Secret Lab A. Its very existence\nwas a secret.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But I think I know you well enough.\nI think I can trust you to show it the world.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmph...\c\nMaybe it’s time I see a bit more of the\nworld myself...\c\nand starting with that Pokémon League, I think.\c\nI hear that Alola’s got a real strong Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can’t even take Type: Null?\nHow many Pokémon have you collected?\c\nI can’t even believe you...\c\nFine. Come back when you’re ready to take it.[VAR 0114(0013)]

M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWelcome back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Young Master Gladion also left something with\nme for you. It is Type: Null.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll also entrust you with all of the memory drives\nneeded to change the type of Type: Null’s\r\nEvolution—the Pokémon Silvally.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
Type: Null...\c\nIt was being researched as a possible weapon\nto be used to fight the Ultra Beasts, but I think\r\na Trainer like you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nMaster Gladion thinks you will be able to show\nType: Null that there is much more to this wide\r\nworld than that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But you have so many Pokémon already that\nyou cannot accept Type: Null now.\c\nPlease come back to get it.\nI will be here, in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Master Gladion left to travel Kanto and Johto,\nso far away from here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
For training?
Taking a vacation?
Yes, that’s right!\c\nHe went to defeat Trainers like you, young\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], and Master Hau.\c\nHe chose to go on a journey to train himself,\nrather than take part in Alola’s island challenge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you do the same thing as everyone else,\nit is unlikely you will surpass them...\c\nI think Master Gladion must remember the tales\nI have told him of catching Pokémon in regions\r\nlike Kanto and have been inspired to action.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Honestly, I cannot imagine Master Gladion ever\ntaking a vacation...\c\nBut I know he can make it anywhere he goes on\nhis own...\r\nNo. Not on his own. With his Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve heard that he even patched up his own\nclothing when it got torn up by his partner,\r\nType: Null...\c\nMaster Gladion is once again taking charge of\nhis own life and is this time heading to Kanto\r\nand nearby regions to train himself.
I have to tell you how much I appreciate what\nyou did for Miss Lillie and Madam Lusamine.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Miss Lillie asked me a last favor before she left.\c\nShe wanted me to explain to you why\nshe and her mother had to go to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You see...\c\nwhile we do not know if it was because of\nNihilego’s neurotoxins, her fusion with that\r\nbeast, or the strain of the Z-Power...[VAR 0114(0016)]
the ill effects of this episode on Madam\nLusamine’s body and mind have been undeniable.\r\nShe has hardly roused since.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But Miss Lillie found a ray of hope in a book\nthat she remembered reading long ago.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It was regarding a man named Bill, who invented\nthe Pokémon Storage System used in our PCs.[VAR 0114(0016)]
This inventor, who lives in the Kanto region,\nonce combined himself with a Pokémon in an\r\nexperiment that apparently went awry...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Just like Lusamine...
Why would he do that?
Yes, perhaps there are even more examples in\nthe world of people fusing with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I suppose it was the same sort of curiosity\nthat led him to develop our storage system.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The records of this event, however, say that\nhe was separated from the Pokémon by using\r\nhis Teleporter and a Cell Separation System.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Perhaps using the same kind of procedure on\nMadam Lusamine will be able to remove the\r\nlast of the beast’s poisons from her system.\c\nThat is what Miss Lillie was hoping when she\nheaded to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It pained me greatly when both Miss Lillie and\nyoung Master Gladion left Aether Paradise...\c\nbut I am so proud to see the fine young people\nthat they have become.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even sheltered little Master Gladion tried to\npatch up his own clothing, he said, when his\r\npartner Null tore them...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh! I’m sorry. You probably aren’t interested\nin hearing about that sort of thing, are you?\c\nHere, please accept this.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...\c\nOh! And take another, too![VAR 0114(0016)]
Now I’ll be returning to the conservation area\nto look after the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I heard that you became the Alola Champion.\nCongratulations![VAR 0114(0027)]
While you were getting stronger, doing the\nisland challenge...[VAR 0114(0026)]

It’s so mysterious...\c\nto be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a\nregion so far away from Kalos...[VAR 0114(0026)]
But we are Trainers.\c\nRather than explaining it all in words, why don’t\nwe just show you what Mega Evolution is![VAR 0114(0027)]
The Trainer holds the Key Stone!\c\nThe Pokémon holds the Mega Stone!\c\nAnd that’s how you can make your Pokémon\nMega Evolve during battle![VAR 0114(0027)]
You can use the Z-Power Ring!\c\nSo you must be able to use a Key Stone that\nmakes Mega Stones resonate![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you have a Key Stone, you’ll be able to make\nyour Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone\r\nMega Evolve![VAR 0114(0027)]
This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam\nMega Evolve. It’s called an Alakazite!\c\nI’ll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
You know, when you think about it, the Z-Power\nRing helps the feelings of a Trainer reach their\r\nPokémon so it can use its Z-Move, right?\c\nIt only follows that it should be able to achieve\nMega Evolution, too![VAR 0114(0026)]

So... I see you’ve had [VAR NUM3(0000)] battles against\nother Trainers...
It seems you understand how Pokémon types\nmatch up perfectly!
Oh ho! And you take advantage of Pokémon’s\nAbilities in battle, too!
I wonder if any Trainer can defeat you\nand [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
You’re so powerful... You may have gotten the\nattention of the tapu.
How...how powerful can one become?! You\nseem to have pursued victory above all else!
Battle after battle...even when you have to\nstop, it’s not long before you’re up and at it.\c\nKeep striving for victories—find something there\nthat only you can find!
I see... You’ve had more battles than I could\npossibly count!
Now then... I wonder if you can seize victory\neven from me?
I will
I don’t think so
No need to force yourself if you’re not feeling it.\nThat’s important if you want to keep winning.
I’ve also experienced many battles—maybe even\nmore than you!\c\nNow, it’s time to see who is truly the better\nPokémon Trainer! No holding back!
Everything will work out, if you choose to keep\nfighting for victory! Oh, and speaking of choice,\r\nlet me give you Choice Specs! If a Pokémon\r\nholds them, they’ll be stuck using only the first\r\nmove they chose in battle, but their Sp. Atk will\r\nbe boosted by 50 percent!

I see, I see. You have [VAR NUM2(0000)] TMs!\c\nAsk for a Ride Pokémon’s help, and look all over\nfor TMs.
Oh! You have [VAR NUM2(0000)] TMs!\c\nRumor has it that there is a place somewhere\nin Alola where strong Trainers gather and\r\ncompete against each other.\c\nI’ve heard that you can obtain various\nTMs there.
Wow! You have [VAR NUM2(0000)] TMs!\c\nYou’re a great Trainer! You use TMs to show\na whole new world to your Pokémon!
TMs... They can teach moves to Pokémon just\nby using them... What are they, really?
Do they bring out Pokémon’s potential to use\nmoves?\c\nAssuming that’s so, if they are used on a\nhuman like you, can you learn a move...?\c\nI guess we can’t try that.
Love TMs, and teach a lot of moves to\nyour Pokémon!

Congratulations once again on completing the\ntrial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
I have a favor I would like to ask of such a\nlovely Trainer.\r\nYou would be willing to help me out, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I would like you to go to the deepest part of\nVerdant Cavern instead of me, the captain,\r\nand place a piece of Normalium Z on the\r\npedestal that is found there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And so... I give you this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m afraid I have to take the stage to fill a\nlittle role in my mother’s place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But there are many young trial-goers starting\ntheir island challenge now, inspired by your\r\nsuccess, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nDon’t let them down![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m the Trial Guide.\c\nThank you for helping out our captain this time.
All you need to do is place the Normalium Z you\ngot from Ilima on the pedestal deep inside.\c\nHowever, you WILL be attacked by the Totem\nPokémon! To the totem, any and all who enter\r\nare opponents who must be defeated. That’s\r\nwhat it means for a captain to train a totem!
But you made it through your own trial,\nright, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nI’m sure you’ll be fine!\nNow let’s test what you’re really made of!
You feel a piercing gaze that seems to cut right\nthrough you...but from where?
Will you place the Z-Crystal on the pedestal?
[VAR PKNAME(0000)], the Totem Pokémon of\nVerdant Cavern, has appeared!
Thhhh!
Thhhh!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] disappeared back into the\ncave somewhere...
Will you place the Z-Crystal on the pedestal?
You reached out to place the Z-Crystal on\nthe pedestal!
What an incredible Trainer you are!
Hahaha!\nDid I sound like Captain Ilima just now?
But you did just as well as we might have\nexpected, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nEven the totem that Ilima has been training up\nwas no match for you.
In the place of our captain, I present you with a\nfine gift so all may know what a great job you\r\ndid for us!
You received a Trial Guide Cap and a Trial\nGuide Tee!
You received a Trial Guide Cap and a Trial\nGuide Tee!
We’ll be sure to call on you again the next time\nwe need a favor done!
Head right into the heart of Verdant Cavern,\nand place that Normalium Z on the pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, look at you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou could not only pass for a captain...\nEven that Trial Guide outfit fits you to a tee.\r\nUntil we meet again, then.[VAR 0114(000C)]

My favorite has got to be the lovely Meowth\nto my left!
Mreh heh.
It’s SO cute and lovely and smart, it’s almost too\nmuch to take!\c\nOh! Sorry! Once I start bragging, oh, how the\ntime does get away from me!\c\nAhem!\nNow, as I was saying...
Are you taking photos of your favorite\nPokémon for them?\c\nThe more photos you take of your Pokémon at\nthe Alola Photo Club, the more affectionate\r\nthey become toward you!\c\nIn fact, I can see how affectionate your Pokémon\nare feeling toward you. Mm-hmm...
Impossible!\c\nY-your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is just as affectionate\ntoward you as Meowth is toward me!\c\nIf you love your Pokémon that much then I must\nname you a member of the Pokémon Fan Club!\c\nWhich means that I should also give you access\nto our exclusive heart-themed background,\r\nwhich only our members can use for photos!\c\nYou should head off to an Alola Photo Club at\nonce to snap some shots with your Pokémon!
Ahhh, but your Pokémon could still be more\naffectionate toward you than it is now.\c\nBecome true friends with that Pokémon, and\nI’ll recognize you as a proper Pokémon Fan!
W-would you like to hear about how wonderful\nmy Meowth is?
Oh!\c\nYou see, my favorite Meowth here is the cutest!\nIt’s SO cute and lovely and smart, it’s almost\r\ntoo much to take!\c\nPlus, it’s really just amazing when you stop to\nlook at it. Don’t you think so?\c\nOh yes. Its looks are so stunning and its heart\nso kindly, you can’t help but love it!\c\nAnd when you hug it tight when it’s sleeping,\nit’s so warm and cuddly...\c\nPlus, it looks spectacular when you pose\ntogether with it in photos, of course.\c\nOh, and it’s simply ravishing when...
...Oops! Look at the time!\nI kept you too long!
Oh...\nWhat a shame...
Ho! You’re not only a Champion in battle\nbut even an ace at loving your Pokémon!\c\nBut I won’t be outdone when it comes to loving\nPokémon the most. I’m the true Champion there!

Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
I’ve even got a special gift for a Trainer like you,\nwho managed to clear Acerola’s trial!\r\nWhich would you like to take?
Fresh Water
Normal water
Here’s a Fresh Water for you!
Fresh Water gets expensive because it has to\nbe shipped here to Alola over the ocean.\c\nThe Fresh Water from Mt. Silver is really great.
Oh! Sorry...\nThe normal water is actually mine!\r\nBut I’ll give you this Fresh Water instead!
I store up this normal water by catching my\nPoliwhirl’s Water Gun and filtering it through\r\ncloth into a cup. Water is precious in the desert!
Oh, and take an Adrenaline Orb, too!\c\nIf you use one, it’ll make wild Pokémon more\nlikely to call allies in battle.\c\nAnd the Pokémon they call are sometimes extra\nstrong or even different-colored Shiny Pokémon!
Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
Alola, Champion!\c\nBeyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!

An old photo dropped out from between\nthe pages...
You picked up an old photograph!
The old photograph shows a girl, a Mudsdale,\nand a garden.
Oh...a photo. Maybe I can find out who it\nbelongs to by checking who borrowed the book.\r\nHere, I’ll hold on to the photo for you.
You handed over the old photograph.
Mu-hiiiiiin!
Mudsdale is looking at you intently...
Oh, you’re the one who found the photo at\nMalie Library, right? One of the staff there let\r\nme know about it, and about you finding it.
Do you see, Mudsdale? That’s the two of us in\nthe photo, back when I was young.
Ni-hiiiiiiiin!
Oh, this brings back memories...
Mu-hiiiiiin!
Mudsdale, calm down!
Muhiin...
It must be so frustrating to keep losing... I know\nit makes you furious. But don’t worry, I’ll always\r\nbe with you, OK? We’ll always be together...
Let’s train hard and do our best to beat the\nyoung kahuna’s grand trial.
Mudsdale and I have been together since then...\nAnd before I knew it, Hapu came along as well.
Although, it seems Hapu has made friends other\nthan Mudsdale, too.
I am very grateful for that... This Heart Scale is\na symbol of my thanks.

I can tell how many times you’ve had opposing\nPokémon call for help during battle!\c\nIf I use a mysterious machine that an enigmatic\nman gave to me, that is.
I can tell your opposing wild Pokémon have\ncalled for help [VAR NUM4(0000,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s!
Your opposing Pokémon have called for help\ncountless times!
Wild Pokémon...\c\nThey call for help when they’re backed into a\ncorner—for example, when their HP goes down.
But a Pokémon with a status condition—such as\nbeing poisoned, paralyzed, or asleep—won’t call\r\nfor help...
Just between you and me...\c\nthere may be some Pokémon that you’ll never\nencounter unless they are called on for help!
Here, take these Adrenaline Orbs!
Using an Adrenaline Orb makes wild Pokémon\nmore likely to call for help.
Your opposing Pokémon have called for help\ncountless times!\c\nYou must be a great Pokémon Trainer!

I’m not a Trainer! I just really like Poké Balls.\nAn infinite world, in such a small, round space!
Oh, so I see you caught your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nwith [VAR iCOLOR2(0001)][VAR ITEM2(0001)]!
Wait, is that a M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-\nM-M-M-M-M-Master Ball?!\c\nA seriously, for-real Master Ball?\c\nThe ultimate Poké Ball—the ball that can\ncatch any Pokémon without fail!\c\nIt’s the master-est of Poké Balls—truly\nthe most masterly!\c\nI’ve never seen one before, but everything\nabout it screams master!\c\nIts color, its roundness...\nEverything is so masterfully crafted!\c\nI bet [VAR PKNAME(0000)] in there is enjoying a\nmasterlike environment!\c\nI don’t know what a masterlike environment is,\nbut still...
No matter how many times I see it,\nthe Master Ball just takes my breath away!
Oh, yeah, Ultra Balls are awesome!\c\nWhat’s so cool about them is that they’re\ntwice as effective as normal Poké Balls, and\r\nfour times as expensive!
The Great Ball is just great, isn’t it?\nYeah, the Great Ball is really great.
How about that, a Poké Ball! And\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] is inside it!\c\nIt’s the most basic way of catching Pokémon,\nbut basics are really important!\c\nI hear there are some Pokémon Trainers out\nthere who use only Poké Balls to catch\r\nall of their Pokémon!
H-hey, a Net Ball! It makes catching\nWater- and Bug-type Pokémon easier,\r\nfor some reason.\c\nMaybe it makes them feel safe, just like\nif we were using a real net!
Ooooh, a Dive Ball! Makes catching Pokémon\nthat live underwater a lot easier.\c\nDid you meet [VAR PKNAME(0000)] while fishing?\nOr maybe while going for a cruise on\r\nyour Ride Pokémon?
Nest Balls are sooooooo nice! Catching low\nleveled Pokémon has never been easier!\c\nI also like that it loses its effect if a Pokémon is\nabove Lv. 30! I mean, how can it even tell?
Oh, a Repeat Ball! These are always interesting.\nThey make catching Pokémon you’ve already\r\ncaught before a breeze!\c\nSo, does that mean you’ve caught a bunch\nof [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?\c\nI don’t know if you’ve caught on, but I use\nthe words catch and caught a lot!
You can have a good time with Timer Balls!\nThe longer a battle with a wild Pokémon\r\nlasts, the better your chances of catching it!\c\nIt’s super good for Pokémon that keep restoring\ntheir HP during battle!
Oh, a Luxury Ball! Really showing your\nPokémon that you care!\c\nIf you keep a Pokémon in a Luxury Ball in your\nparty, it’ll grow friendlier a lot quicker!\c\nI bet it’s super luxurious and comfy in there.
Premier Balls look so chic! Although I always\nwonder... What sort of event is it supposed to\r\nbe commemorating?\c\nStill, the sleek, white design is super cool!
Oh, a Dusk Ball... Good to use at night...or in\ncaves... Y’know, dark, gloomy environments...\c\nMakes catching Pokémon there easier...
A Heal Ball, I see! Taking good care of your\nPokémon, eh?\c\nIt heals up both a Pokémon’s HP and PP,\nmaking them ready for battle immediately!
Oh, hey, a Quick Ball! Here’s a haiku about it\nfor you.\c\nPokémon Trainers\nshould use a Quick Ball quickly\r\nfor met Pokémon.\c\n...It’s the best I could do, OK?
Wow, a Cherish Ball! Poké Balls made to\ncommemorate a really special occasion...\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] looks really comfy in there.\nI bet it’s a really special Pokémon, too!
Oh look, a Fast Ball! Those are handy,\naren’t they?\c\nGreat for when you want to capture those\nPokémon that are a little too quick on their feet!\c\nIf the Pokémon’s Speed is over 100, you\ngotta use a Fast Ball!
Oh, a Level Ball! This is an interesting one!\nThey make catching Pokémon that are at a\r\nlower level than your Pokémon easier.\c\nI always wondered how that works. Maybe\nthe Level Ball has some sort of powerful aura!
Nice, a Lure Ball! This ball makes going\nfishing a breeze!\c\nSo, where did you fish up [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
A Heavy Ball! Those are neat! This is definitely\nthe Poké Ball to use for heavy Pokémon!\c\nBut wait... Even if you catch a super heavy\nPokémon, the Poké Ball’s weight\r\ndoesn’t change...
Aww, a Love Ball! How nice! It works best when\nthe wild Pokémon is the same species, but\r\nopposite gender, of your own Pokémon.
A Friend Ball! Those are so nice! Any Pokémon\nyou catch with it is instantly your friend!\c\nThat means the Return move’s power is\nbumped up to 80, too!
A Moon Ball! This is a very unique Poké Ball.\nThis ball is good for catching Pokémon that\r\nevolve when you use a Moon Stone.\c\nThat means Nidorina, Nidorino, Clefairy,\nJigglypuff, Skitty, and Munna!
A Beast Ball?! What is that?!\nI bet it’s a beast of a ball!
Oh, that is a Poké Ball you don’t see often!\nI can feel the weight of history from it!\c\nI guess you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\ngo back a long way, huh?

You can set up to six Battle Teams to be used\nin different situations.\c\nThat way you can distinguish the team you use\nfor your journey from the special team that\r\nyou might use just for Battle Royals, for example!
Also, you can have the same Pokémon\nin different Battle Teams!\c\nPlease, please use Battle Boxes from your\nBoxes in your PC.
You use Battle Boxes! Great!\nI can happily call you my friend.\c\nI’ll give you something good because you’re\nmy friend!

There are many reasons why a Trainer might not\nbe able to return to their Pokémon, but when\r\nthat happens, either we have a relative take\r\ncare of them or we let them go from their\r\nPC Boxes.
But there’s one Pokémon that won’t go back to\nthe wild, no matter how many times we try to\r\nrelease it...
Cooped up in its Box, with nobody coming to\nget it... That can’t be good for the Pokémon.
It would be great if there was someone who\nknew its Trainer...
Do you want me to look?
That’s terrible...
There’s only so much I can do, even as a\nfoundation employee... So to be honest, I’d love\r\nit if you could help us out.
Thank you so much. Please, take this Poké Ball...
I wonder sometimes... Does the relationship\nbetween Pokémon and Trainers never change,\r\neven when one of them goes missing?
The Trainer who passed away... All we know is\nthat he was from Ula’ula Island. I hope you can\r\nfind something...
Hey, Mom? Do you know how Granddaddy’s\nPokémon are doing? I hope they’re OK...
I don’t know... Maybe they’re going on another\nisland challenge, with a new Trainer.
Dartrix jumped out of the Poké Ball entrusted\nto you!
Hoo...
Dartrix! You’re Granddaddy’s Dartrix,\naren’t you?!
Wait, why do you have Granddaddy’s Dartrix?!
You explained how you were entrusted with the\nPoké Ball.
You liked Granddaddy so much, you didn’t want\nto go anywhere, huh...
Well, don’t worry, Dartrix! From now on, I’ll be\nwith you all the time!
For the island challenge?
To battle?
I don’t know! All I know is I just want to be with\nit, all the time!
Heh heh...
You returned Dartrix to its Poké Ball.
You handed over the Left Poké Ball.
Thank you!
Here, take this Mental Herb in exchange!
Dartrix, you have to tell me all about my\ngranddaddy! Like, why did he never evolve you\r\ninto a Decidueye?

Are you feeling a bit calmer now, Dad?\nSee, even if we aren’t the strongest...\r\nwe want to do our best, just the two of us!\r\nNo, the four of us! With our Gastly, too!
Come on, honey!\nLet’s go get our marriage license!
Th-that’s right!\nAnd our Gastly can be together, too!
Phew... You understand, don’t you, kid?\nYour work’s not over once you catch a Pokémon.\c\nIt’s by battling and taking that time together\nthat you really get to know one another...\r\nand I’d say that a marriage is just the same.\c\nBut I just don’t know how to talk about those\nkinds of things with my baby girl.\c\nAt least I’ve shared my nugget of wisdom with\nyou, kid. And this glittering Nugget, too.
Now...I just have to see if I can summon up a\nsmile at the wedding ceremony...\c\nFool kids. If they both brought out their Gastly,\nthey probably could have beat me, too...
When our Gastly evolve, we should trade them\nwith one another!
If you use moves like Foresight or Odor Sleuth,\nNormal-type moves can hit Ghost types, too!

Hiyah! I challenge you to a battle!
I accept!
I decline!
Master! It is as you said—the true art of battle\nis to triumph without even fighting!
Master, please lend me your strength!
Master, I am sorry... I have failed you...

This is Master Bewear, to whom I have\nbecome an apprentice...
And who is a master of a mysterious, wild\nform of martial art...\r\nknown only as the Pokémon style!

Master was generous enough to act as my\nPokémon just now, but be warned!\c\nShould Master wish it, he could break\neven the most brawny of men in twain!
Hm, what’s this? Do I see in your possession\nFightinium Z?! \c\nProof that you have completed Kahuna Hala’s\ngrand trial!
Kahuna Hala and my master are rivals of old!\c\nBack in the day, they fought for one week\nstraight without pause, before calling it a draw!
Grrourrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
As you wish, Master!

So this is Aether Paradise...\nA fine facility you have here, Madam President![VAR 0114(002F)]
I... ... ...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Is something...the matter?[VAR 0114(002F)]
N-no, nothing...\nYou’re here for...a tour today?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yes! Please call me Mohn.\c\nI operate a series of islands known as Poké\nPelago, where we take care of Pokémon.\c\nBut nothing comes close to the care offered at\nAether Paradise, after all![VAR 0114(002F)]
Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYour Pokémon enjoy Poké Pelago, don’t they?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Sure do!
Well, uh...
Ha! OK! Sorry about that!\nI suppose I put you on the spot there.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Oops! I guess I shouldn’t put you on the spot\nwhen we’re right in front of the president!\r\nI don’t expect you to pick sides or anything![VAR 0114(002F)]
This is fascinating, though...\c\nI let the Pokémon mostly do as they please back\nat Poké Pelago, so I’m not sure how much I can\r\napply of what you do here at Aether Paradise...\c\nBut it’s a fine facility indeed![VAR 0114(002F)]
Heh heh... Is that so?\c\nWell, Aether Paradise is primarily designed for\nPokémon conservation efforts, after all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Though...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Though...?[VAR 0114(002F)]
No matter how hard we might work to heal a\nPokémon, in the end, it may simply end up stuck\r\nin some PC Box somewhere, depending on the\r\nwhims of its Trainer.\c\nSometimes I can’t help but think on that...[VAR 0114(0014)]
I see...\c\nIt’s true that each Trainer does end up deciding\nwhat to do with the Pokémon they catch...\c\nI suppose I’ll just have to find more islands,\nso I can expand Poké Pelago and care for even\r\nmore boxed Pokémon there![VAR 0114(002F)]
When that time comes, I do hope that we might\nbe able to work together, ma’am.[VAR 0114(002F)]

Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou look well.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey there, Champion! You already know how\nrad Z-Moves are, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yup!
Uhh...
So those Z-Crystals you collected on your\nisland challenge are comin’ in handy![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I guess you don’t have to use the\nZ-Crystals you collected on your\r\nisland challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But where does the awesomeness of Z-Moves\ncome from? That’s been one of the themes of\r\nmy research into Pokémon moves.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It all starts with your Z-Power Ring, yeah,\nforged from the Sparkling Stone you got straight\r\nfrom Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0005)]
When you use your Z-Crystals, it brings you and\nyour Pokémon together![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, it seems that some sort of invisible bond is\ncreated between a Trainer and their Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, a Trainer sends their physical and mental\nenergy, and their Pokémon are surrounded by\r\nan aura![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, what is it that allows a Trainer to send their\npower to a Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sparkling Stone?
Z-Power Ring?
Yeah, it’s that Z-Power Ring, made from a\nrefined Sparkling Stone, that changes a Trainer’s\r\npower into light and gives their Pokémon\r\nan aura![VAR 0114(0005)]
Then there is the light pouring into Alola from\nthe Ultra Wormhole that Solgaleo opened up...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Then there is the light pouring into Alola from\nthe Ultra Wormhole that Lunala opened up...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s an important point!\c\nCould Sparkling Stones have also come through\nthe Ultra Wormhole and landed here in Alola?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Long, long ago, Necrozma lost part of its body—\nat least that’s what the Ultra Recon Squad said.[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you combine my theory with what we’ve\nheard from the Ultra Recon Squad...[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Sparkling Stones themselves might be that\npart of Necrozma’s body that it lost![VAR 0114(0006)]
If that’s the case, then Necrozma...\c\nWhen it’s with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it can get\nback that part of itself that was once lost.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It might just be a theory, but you are one\nawesome Trainer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
And Necrozma, in its own way, is an\nawesome Pokémon! Hee![VAR 0114(0006)]
I heard about it from Colress, yeah...\c\nHe told me you can give Solgaleo’s light\nto Necrozma![VAR 0114(0005)]
I heard about it from Colress, yeah...\c\nHe told me you can give Lunala’s light\nto Necrozma![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, and then Necrozma can change back into\nthat brilliant form![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve heard old stories about how Necrozma was\ndriven back by the light, but maybe people were\r\njust giving it the light it needed.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Someday I hope I can use a Z-Move with a\nPokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All right! Thanks to my assistant Lillie, yeah,\nand the Champion h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imerself, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\r\noh yeah, I was finally able to unlock one piece\r\nof the Z-Move puzzle, woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
But the mechanism of exactly how Z-Moves\nwork remains shrouded in mystery, yeah...\c\nI’m still counting on both of you to help me\nfigure it all out![VAR 0114(0005)]

Huh? Did you open the barricade by mistake?\nWhat if I went through the gate?
You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
I really want to pass the trial with\nGhost Pokémon!\c\nBut Ghost-type moves won’t hit the\nPokémon there.
Please come back when you turn 11![VAR 0114(000C)]
Why?! I want to try!\nI want to try the island challenge!
I’m sorry, but...\nNo captain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
I haven’t done the trial, so I don’t think\nI can pass through this barricade.
You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
Hehe... No matter how many times I’m turned\ndown, I’ll keep coming back.\c\nAnd I’ll keep taking a peek at the Totem\nPokémon, and when I turn 11, I’ll clear the trial\r\nat my first go!

My bro is super strong at Pokémon, you know![VAR 0114(003E)]
I borrowed my bro’s Pokémon.\nWithout asking, actually, but do you want\r\nto have a battle?![VAR 0114(003E)]
Huh! Scared of losing, I bet![VAR 0114(003E)]
Heh! I’ll beat you, no sweat![VAR 0114(003E)]
What? Why?!\c\nMy bro’s Pokémon is super strong.\nWhy did I lose?![VAR 0114(003E)]
Hey, you![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh no!\nH-hey, Big Bro...[VAR 0114(003E)]
You brought my Pokémon out again\nwithout asking, didn’t you?![VAR 0114(003D)]
I-I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(003E)]
And it looks like you got soundly defeated, too.[VAR 0114(003D)]
Yeah... But all your Pokémon are super strong,\nBig Bro... I don’t get why...?[VAR 0114(003E)]
Even if they have potential, if you don’t let them\nfight properly, Pokémon can’t unleash their\r\nfull power![VAR 0114(003D)]
You can only understand how strong your\nPokémon are by giving them love and attention\r\non a daily basis.[VAR 0114(003D)]
If you want to win with borrowed Pokémon,\nyou need to train yourself, too![VAR 0114(003D)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(003E)]
I always blamed my Pokémon when\nI’d lose against friends...[VAR 0114(003E)]
but that’s what’s been preventing\nme from really becoming strong...[VAR 0114(003E)]
I’m going to spend more time\nwith my own Pokémon!\c\nAnd I promise I’ll beat you together\nwith them, Bro![VAR 0114(003E)]
Hah! I won’t let you win easily![VAR 0114(003D)]
Sorry you had to get tangled up in this\nweird situation. Take this for your troubles![VAR 0114(003D)]
Right, I’ll race you back home![VAR 0114(003D)]
Yeah!\nI’ll see you ’round![VAR 0114(003E)]

Now then...\nHow am I going to track them all down?
Oh. You look like an energetic young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.\nDo you think you could help me a bit?
Ah, how silly of me to think that I could hold\nup such a busy young person. My apologies.
Thank you.\c\nI’m actually back in Heahea City today for the\nfirst time in 30 years.\c\nI’m supposed to have a little reunion with a few\nclassmates from when I was a young man.
But I hadn’t been back in so long...\c\nThe building where we had always planned to\nmeet is gone now, and not a trace of it left.\c\nIt has been 30 years, though, so it’s hardly\na surprise.
I’m sorry to ask you, but could you search out\nmy three friends in Heahea City and tell them\r\nto join me here?
I think my friends must be somewhere here in\nHeahea City. Please find them for me!\c\nWe’re all a bunch of old folks now, so we don’t\nmove too quick.\r\nIt shouldn’t be much work to track them down.
Woo!
Hello there.\nDid you need some help with something?
You asked the gentleman if he is perhaps\nfriends with the old man in the Tide Song Hotel.
Why, I am precisely one of those friends!\c\nThank you for coming. You really saved me a lot\nof trouble! I’ll head to the hotel at once.
I was able to meet my old friend once again,\nthanks to you.
You, youngster. Have you seen a group of old\nfarts like me around here anywhere?
You asked the old woman if she is perhaps\nfriends with the old man in the Tide Song Hotel.
Yes, yes! That’s exactly who I was looking for!\c\nAhhh, what a relief!\nOur meeting place was torn down, you see.\c\nI’ll be off to that hotel at once then.\nThank you again!
Oh, why, look at you!\nYou used to be just a little Bonsly!\r\nIt’s good to see how you’ve grown!
Oh, sheesh, you guys!\nWhere have you all gone off to?!\c\nIt’s been 30 years! How am I supposed to\nknow where you would go to meet now?!
You asked the young woman if she is perhaps\nfriends with the old man in the Tide Song Hotel.
Oh! Yes, I am!\nThank you very much!\r\nSo it’s the Tide Song Hotel, is that it?
Who else was around in those days?\nDo you remember?
Boy, it really takes you back, doesn’t it?
You really remember everybody, don’t you?
Woo! ♪
You’re all just the same as ever.
You’re the one who is just the same! In fact,\nyou look younger now than you did back then!
And it’s not easy, I’ll have you know!\nI’ve been using that Mareanie treatment, see.\r\nA touch of that poison spike to your face, and...
Eeesh! No thank you!\nIt sounds so painful I don’t even want to hear it!
Hahaha!\nYou two haven’t changed at all!
My friends, the world may have changed around\nus, but we will never change!\c\nEven if they did make my old house into a\nPokémon Center!\c\nEven if folks go surfing on Mantine now instead\nof paddling around in boats like we used to!\c\nWe’re still alive and we’ll go on having a good\nold time! What do you say?!
Sounds good to me!
I’m about to get married for the sixth time...\c\nBut it’s nice to be back here on Akala.\nMaybe I should move here with my next hubby.
Oh! You beat our sweet pal Hala?\nThat’s wonderful!\c\nMaybe we should all go over to Melemele and\npay him a little visit.
Is that an island challenge amulet?\nHo, now that sure brings back some memories!
Oh! Thanks to you, we got the whole gang\nback together again.\c\nTake this with my thanks, if you please.
As you get older, the number of friends you\nhave left gets fewer and fewer...\r\nYou’ve got to treasure those you have left!

Text File : 640
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Um, excuse me...\nAre you a person of courage?
I think so
Maybe not
Is that right? That’s so nice for you...\c\nPerhaps a courageous person like you would\nlisten to my worries and be able to help me.\r\nDo you have a free minute?
You’re not? Then I guess you’re rather like me!\c\nBut I think perhaps you’re just being modest.\nYou might be rather courageous after all.\r\nDo you have a free minute now?
Oh...um... Right.\nThen maybe another time. Please.
Thank you for telling me about your inspiring\ndemonstrations of courage before.\c\nDo you...do you maybe have any new tales you\ncould share with me?\r\nYou’re the only one I can count on...
It’s taking all the courage I’ve got just to make\nmyself talk to you like this, I’m afraid.
That’s how easily my courage is all used up!\nJust striking up a simple conversation...\r\nIt really is pathetic, I know.\c\nSo please, please...\nCouldn’t you tell me some story of courage that\r\nwill inspire me to feel a bit braver?
But you’ve got nothing particularly new you\ncan think to tell him about!
If you do end up doing anything that you think\nwould make for a thrilling tale of courage,\r\nplease come and tell me all about it!
And so you told the boy about taking part in a\nBattle Royal.
Wow! That’s amazing!\nYou actually took part in a Battle Royal?\c\nEven just having a battle against one other\nperson takes plenty of courage...\c\nBut going up against three Trainers at once!\nYou can do that?!
You know, hearing about that gave me a bit of\ncourage! I’d say I’m at 20 percent courage now!\c\nIf you don’t mind, please come tell me about\nmore of your courageous deeds when you can!
You are something else, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nEvery time that I hear about your exploits,\r\nI begin to feel a little more courageous myself!
And so you told the boy about how you cleared\nKiawe’s trial.
Wow! That’s amazing!\nYou cleared Kiawe’s trial?!\c\nKiawe’s so loud when he talks, and the volcano\npark is so hot, and the people you meet up\r\nthere all seem pretty fired up, too...\c\nThere’s no way I could take all that on, but\nyou were able to go there and pass the trial!
You know, hearing about that gave me a bit of\ncourage! I’d say I’m at 40 percent courage now!\c\nIf you don’t mind, please come tell me about\nmore of your courageous deeds when you can!
And so you told the boy about your trip to\nAether Paradise and what happened there!
Eek!\nReally? That really happened?\c\nA mysterious creature, and you couldn’t even\ntell if it was a Pokémon or not?\c\nI would have been so scared that I never would\nhave had the courage to battle such a thing!\c\nBut you just took it upon yourself to fight it off?\nEven though there were other Trainers there,\r\ntoo? You really are amazing!
You know, hearing about that gave me a bit of\ncourage! I’d say I’m at 60 percent courage now!\c\nIf you don’t mind, please come tell me about\nmore of your courageous deeds when you can!
And so you told the boy about everything that\nwent down in Po Town.
Whoa!\nYou actually went into Po Town?!\c\nI heard that if you go there, you get forced to\njoin Team Skull and wear this strange outfit\r\nand make all these crazy poses...\c\nYou went to that kind of scary place, and you\neven took on Team Skull and beat them?!\c\nEven that kind of thing is possible for you...
You know, hearing about that gave me a bit of\ncourage! I’d say I’m at 80 percent courage now!\c\nIf you don’t mind, please come tell me about\nmore of your courageous deeds when you can!
And so you told the boy about riding through\nan Ultra Wormhole with Ultra Warp Ride!
Wh-what?!\c\nYou rode on the back of the actual Legendary\nPokémon [VAR PKNAME(0001)] to reach some other world?!\r\nIsn’t that, like, too unbelievable even for you?!\c\nYou just went off to a horrifying place like that,\nwith no idea of what might happen to you?\r\nNo hesitation at all?\c\nAll for the sake of Alola...?\nAll for the sake of...us...?\r\n... ... ...
I understand...\c\nI’ve been making up all kinds of reasons till now,\nand using my lack of courage as an excuse\r\nso that I could just run away from the truth,\r\nunable to do anything for myself.
But after hearing about all your courageous\ndeeds so many times, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nNow I finally feel like I want to try my hardest\nat something, too!
Yes! I’m at 100 percent courage now!\c\nPlease grant me the honor of a battle!\c\nMy first Pokémon battle against another Trainer!
Phew! I’m so glad that I gathered up my courage\nand talked to you that day, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nTake this as a token of my gratitude.\nI’m as grateful as anyone could ever be to you.
I’m going to keep trying to take on new\nchallenges, too! Thank you so much!

When I was young, I walked A LOT!\c\nFor example...\nStand on the white square...\c\nFrom there...pass the white triangle,\nthe black triangle, the black circle,\r\nthe white circle, the black triangle,\r\nthe black square, the white circle,\r\nand the white triangle,\r\nand come back to the white square.\c\nI was able to walk that much!
Oh, young Trainer.\c\nYou seemed to have followed the symbols\njust as I told you.\c\nI was watching your healthy walk or run!
Walk and walk in places where there are\nPokémon or no Pokémon.\c\nGo wherever your young heart leads you!\nBe healthy!
You stepped on the correct symbol.

You can aim to be a strong Trainer or an\nastronomer. You’re full of potential!

Hey, hey, hey!\nDon’t tell me...\r\nAre you maybe a trial-goer? Hm?
There’s a favor I’ve been just dying to ask a\nTrainer like you...
I’ll help you!
I’m a little busy...
Oh, well, aren’t you just the sweetest!\nThanks! No, thank you! I’m so glad!
I’m a muy excelente hair stylist, you see!\c\nBut I just came here to the Alola region...\c\nAnd I’ve heard this rumor that I just can’t help\nwondering about...
That’s right...
I’ve heard that there is a Pokémon in Alola\nthat has beautiful curly hair! ¡Hermosa!
I have got to see it, even just for a moment!\nAnd if I could, I’d love to touch its hair!\c\nI’ve been so distracted by my desire that I’ve\nbeen completely useless at work!
But I don’t even know what that Pokémon\nmight be called...
That’s why I came up with this genio plan!\nA trial-goer like you must know tons about all\r\nkinds of Pokémon!
Please, please catch that beautifully bemaned\nPokémon for me, and show me your Pokédex!
I’ll reward you, of course!\nSo please do me a favor here!
Ahhh... I just can’t wait to meet it!\nPlease show me those luscious locks!
Th-that’s...Jynx!\c\nYes, it surely does have luscious locks, but\nthat’s not the Pokémon I was looking for!\r\nThe rumors were about bouncy, curly waves!
No way?! You caught it!\nYou caught that masterfully maned Pokémon!
Oh! Please!\nPlease show me at once!
Oh! Look at what fantástico condition its hair\nis in! Not a single split end in sight?!\c\nI never imagined such a thing...\nA Dugtrio with hair!\c\nHuh? What do you mean it’s not hair?\nYou’re telling me it’s...whiskers?!\c\nAnd it’s called a regional variant?\nSo this is a special form unique to Alola! ¡Caray!
Well, I am muy contento now!\nI’m totally full of thanks for you!
I’ll give you one of my precious treasures to\nthank you for your hard work!\r\n¡Muchas gracias!
Now I’m off to get one of those fancy follicled\nfriends for myself!
I hope you’ll come check it out when I do!\nAlola!
Oh... Well, that is a real letdown, but please help\nme out if you ever find the time!

Oh? Oh, hey, hey, hey!\nYou’re that trial-goer!
I managed to meet a marvelously maned mate\nof my own after our last meeting!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, so thank you!
But, you know, if I were being completely honest,\nI do have one other teeny tiny problem...
My bemaned beauty just doesn’t seem to be\nvery affectionate toward me.\c\nI’ve tried giving it Poké Beans and petting it\nplenty, but what am I doing wrong?
Dugtrio seems to be staring at your hair...
... ... ...\n... ... ...
Deh...
¡Mira! You see that?\nIt’s gone all stroppy, and I don’t know why!
I wonder why that would be...\nCould it be something about your looks, maybe?
Now that I think about it...\c\nThere are these rare occasions when my\nluscious-locked lovely acts really\r\naffectionate toward certain customers...
Dug! Dug dug dug!
Dugtrio is wriggling furiously for some reason!
Dug-dug-dug-dug-dug!!!
Dugtrio just won’t stop!
Calm down, Dugtrio!
Is it OK?!
What got into it all of a sudden?!
Oh! B-but...could it really be?\c\nYes, that has to be it!\nMy precious pretty has got to be...
It’s undeniable! My baby is helplessly attracted\nto beautiful honey blond hair like yours?!
So the reason it wasn’t very affectionate to me\nwas simply that it likes blonds!\c\nMaybe it’s time I changed my look anyway...
Hon...
I’m sorry I’ve caused you so much trouble.\nHere, take this—it’s my favorite product!

Hello? That thing you have there...\nIs that... Could that be...
A Z-Power Ring!
Please! You must have a battle with me!\c\nI want Crabrawler to feel the power\nand energy in a Z-Move!
Once it sees your Pokémon at full power, I bet\nCrabrawler will feel ready for a brawl and finally\r\novercome its shyness and anxiety!

There, there...\nNow, are you ready?
Absolutely!
Give me a sec!
Great, you’re ready to rumble!\nThen let’s do this!
Oh, don’t worry, I’m very patient.\nI’m used to waiting.
Oh, that was wonderful!\nYou were almost shining with all the power!
Don’t you think so, too, Crabrawler?
Cra-blub!
Oh my! Your fighting pose looks wonderful!
Oh, of course... You always hated losing, didn’t\nyou, Crabrawler? You’ve seen other Pokémon\r\nshow their full power, and now you want to, too!
This is all thanks to you!
Cra-blub!
I know, I know...
This is from Crabrawler, as a sign of thanks!
Really, thank you so much...\nWe’re one step closer to our dream!
Um, um... We want to see you at your fullest\npower, holding nothing back.\c\nCome back again tomorrow, and show us \na Z-Move. Go all out!

Hey there, the Bewear costume show is\nstarting soon! Do you want to watch, too?
Oh dear, that’s too bad...\nWell, maybe when you have more time!
Great! One more customer, coming through!\nGo on, take a seat! The show’s about to begin!
Hello, hello! Welcome to the Bewear\ncostume show!
As I’m sure you know, Bewear may look cute,\nbut they’re actually very, very dangerous!
So, in this show, there will be no real Bewear\nmaking an appearance! Please relax, and enjoy!
Now, without further delay...\nHere are our lovely Bewear!
Wow!\nThey look so real![VAR 0114(003E)]
Alola![VAR 0114(0048)]
Wear Bewear wear![VAR 0114(0049)]
Just look at them, ladies and gentlemen!\nThey’re more active than usual!
...Huh?
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Now, who could be in that third\nBewear costume?
Are you a helper Bewear?\nThe more Bewear the merrier![VAR 0114(0048)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
The new Bewear is motionless...
Ooh, could it be...a real one?
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Bewear!![VAR 0114(0047)]
Eeeeek!\nIt’s real![VAR 0114(0049)]
Everyone beware the Bewear!
We gotta get out of here!
Everyone has ran off in a panic!
Wear, bewear, wear...?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Bewear has its gaze fixed on you...
Wear? Bewear?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Run
Wear!
Bewear!
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nYou can’t escape!
Weeeaaarrrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
The menace of Bewear has passed...
*pant pant*...\nHuh? Where did the Bewear go...?!
Did... Did you...?
Oh, thank you, brave Trainer!\nThanks to you, nobody was hurt...
Oh, I’m so relieved now I could cry!\nHow can I ever show my gratitude?\c\nPlease, would you kindly accept this small\ntoken of our thanks to you?
Still, I can’t help but wonder what the\nreal Bewear wanted...\c\nMaybe it wanted to show us how to\nproperly be a Bewear...?

N-no, I knew I couldn’t do this...
Are you OK?!
What’s wrong?
Huh? Oh... Well, you see, my dad gave me a\nDewpider the other day... But well, y’see...\c\nI really, really can’t stand Dewpider!
[~ 4]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
I know this isn’t good, but...
De-dew...
Dewpider is looking dejectedly at the girl...
Well, ’cause! It’s exactly like my dad!
My dad’s always drenched in sweat, no matter\nwhere he goes or what he does...
And so is Dewpider! I am so done with sweat\nbeing splattered everywhere!
Dew-dew-dew!
Dewpider shook its body, and water droplets\nglistened in the light...
See? See?! When it shakes its head, it splashes\nsweat around, just like Dad! How am I supposed\r\nto cope with this?!
Have a battle with it
Join forces
What? Me and Dewpider...together...?\nNo way... That could be a great idea!
If we join forces and have a battle together,\nI bet it’ll help create a bond between us!
I’ll do my best!
Hey, since you’re already here, do you think you\ncould be my opponent?
Sure!
Maybe later!
Thanks! Well then...c’mon, Dewpider!\nLet’s do this!
OK! But you promise you’ll come back, right?\nI’ll be waiting!
Oh man... I’m about to cry... Thanks so much for\nputting up with me. I know I must have sounded\r\nreal selfish! Here, this is for you!
All I wanted was to be able to battle like you\nand your Pokémon did, like a great team.\c\nI wanted to become an awesome team with\nDewpider. I honestly felt that!
Dew-dew!
Dewpider... You were really beautiful while you\nwere fighting!
I’m just so touched!!
My daughter! And Dewpider! Getting along so\nwonderfully! It makes a man want to cry!\c\n*sob sob*
Every time the Hiker moves, water droplets\nsplatter the area.
But they’re definitely not tears...
Wh-why are you here, Dad?! Come on—we gotta\nrun, Dewpider!
Haaahahahahaha! No need to be embarrassed,\nmy dear daughter!
But if it’s a game of tag that you want, you’ll\nfind out I’m no Slowpoke! Here I come!

You can feel a pair of eyes on you...
Keh heh heh heh heh...
Mimikyu?
Pikachu?
Everything went dark!
*tap* ... *tap tap tap* ...\n*hshhh* ... *hshhh* ...
You can hear footsteps in the dark...
Mi! Mi!
Mimikyu is staring steadily your way...
Try picking it up
Try looking under its cloth
Miii!
Mimikyu nuzzled up against you...
Kyu!
Pikachu and Mimikyu are staring steadily\nyour way...
Keh heh heh...
Kyu-u-urses!
Kyu!
Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
A piece of Mimikium Z, the exclusive Z-Crystal\njust for Mimikyu, is lying on the floor!
Oh?\nWhat’re you doing back here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Hey, is that Mimikium Z?!
Wow! I’ve never actually seen a piece before!
It’s really, really rare, you know?
How did you manage to get a piece?!
You explain what happened with Mimikyu...
Wow...\nYou really are some kind of Trainer, aren’t you?
I can’t believe Mimikyu would actually come to\nlike you that much. It’s usually so shy!\r\nI’ve never heard of it doing anything like this.
Yeah, I wonder why...
Is that right?
I’ve heard that some Mimikyu get down because\nTrainers say they’d rather have Pikachu...\c\nI bet our Mimikyu was probably delighted when\nyou were so kind to it.
You know, it’s pretty hard not to like someone\nwho accepts you for who you are.\c\nPokémon and people are alike in that regard.
Or that’s my thought anyway!
I’m glad that Mimikyu got the chance to meet\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThank you. From me and Mimikyu both!
Looks like there’s nothing left to do in here.

A trial-goer, are you?\nYou must believe in your partner[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0100)]s then.\c\nIn that case, I’ll be waiting.\nYes, waiting for you to overcome your trial...\r\nand waiting for the rain to fall once more...
I am waiting for the rain...\nThe rain that will wash everything away.
This is a fine rain...\c\nIt will wash everything away...\nincluding our painful defeat in battle!\c\nWhat do you say? Do you think you can handle\na little skirmish against my Pokémon?
Sure I can
I’ll take a rain check
The pain he left behind when he disappeared...\nThat’s what this rain really is...
Good! My team is perfectly tailored for the rain,\nand they are about to be unleashed upon you!
The power I hoped to gain from the rain...\nIt looks like it didn’t work on you, did it?
I had this friend. This crazy, great friend.\nAnd his name was Johnny, too.\c\nHe would use the move Rain Dance all the time,\nand he could beat absolutely anyone with it.
But then...he fell in love.\c\nHe fell for this right spark whose Pokémon used\nSunny Day...\c\nAnd that was the last anyone ever saw of\ngood old Johnny...
The team I battle with now are the Pokémon\nhe left behind when he up and disappeared.\c\nAnd every time the rain falls, these poor little\nblighters remember old Johnny...
Rainy days are the best...\nNo one can see your tears in the rain.

Hello there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nHow lucky that you would pass by.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You see, it seems that I, Captain Ilima, have\ngotten mixed up in a mysterious incident.\r\nI’m in quite the pickle![VAR 0114(000C)]
Upon returning from a family vacation, I found\nmy guard Machamp passed out on the floor.\c\nWhat’s worse, even though I had hidden it\ncarefully, deep in the back of my bookshelves...[VAR 0114(000C)]
My Nugget has vanished![VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course, I have already found some\nsuspects—these Hypno here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
They were loitering around my home, so I\nwent ahead and brought them in.\c\nAs a captain, it does pain me to cast doubt\non Pokémon, but...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Allow me to briefly introduce you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This Hypno is very skilled at using Hypnosis.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Zzzzzzz...
And this one! During the time of the crime,\nit was using Nasty Plot...\r\nOr at least I think that’s what it’s saying.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Heh heh heh!
The remaining Hypno seems to be able to use\nPsychic to move objects.\c\nIt was levitating a Granbull doll not a\nmoment ago.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Sych!
Well then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWhich Hypno is guilty? Which move could have\r\nbeen used to steal my Nugget?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hypnosis?
Nasty Plot?
Psychic?
The Hypno are upset about being accused!
You handled that well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI was able to deal with the\nother Hypno that were misbehaving.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But to think, Hypno trying to shield one\nanother from blame...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Captain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
Captain Ilima has solved the mystery![VAR 0114(000C)]
Under the guidance of Nasty Plot, they used \nHypnosis to put Machamp to sleep, and then\r\nused Psychic to steal my Nugget![VAR 0114(000C)]
Zzzzzzz...
Heh heh heh!
Sych!
Indeed, the Pokédex from a distant land says\nthat the arching movement and glitter of its\r\npendulum lull its foes into a deep\r\nstate of hypnosis.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I imagine that a Nugget polished with so much\ncare by Captain Ilima would be perfect\r\nas a weight for a pendulum.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Very well! I will gladly give the Nugget to you,\nso long as you promise to share![VAR 0114(000C)]
Zzzzzzz...
Heh heh heh!
Sych!
Now, remember! This time I’m giving it to you\nas a gift, but don’t make this a habit!\c\nStealing other people’s possessions makes\nyou a thief![VAR 0114(000C)]
The case is solved, thanks to you!\nPlease, as a token of my gratitude, take this\r\nBig Nugget I have also polished with care![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, let us head home![VAR 0114(000C)]
Uhh, I still have no idea what that was all about!\nI...I feel as if I’ve been dreaming, or having\r\na nightmare!

These are the Berry Fields.\nBut there aren’t any Berry trees growing here.\c\nDo you want to know why?
I get it. Maybe later then!
Well, you see, we came here to the Alola region\nthinking to help spread the word about using\r\nfertilizer in the Berry Fields here, too.
The town where we come from, a place called\nCamphrier Town in Kalos, grows plenty of\r\nBerries in the nearby fields.\c\nAnd we use fertilizer to help grow our Berries!
But in the Alola region, people don’t have to do\na thing to help Berries grow!\c\nYou can sit back and let nature—and Pokémon—\ndo all the work, and you’ll have more Berries\r\nthan you’ll know what to do with!\c\nAnd that’s why we stopped bothering with\ntrying to farm in the fields here.
In fact, now we’re the ones who are enamored\nwith Alolan Berry culture!\c\nMy new dream is to try to become a true\nBerry master here in Alola!
The Pokémon and the rich nature provide all\nthe Berries we could ever need.\c\nMaybe I should start trying to grow some\ntasty veggies in this field here instead! ♪

Are you curious about why there is a huge\nranch instead of a big city right slap in the\r\nmiddle of Akala Island?
Oh.\nSorry I asked.
This area, which is called Paniola, is a very\nold place in the history of pioneer Alola.
When our ancestors drifted to the islands in\nAlola and decided to live here, the land\r\nwas not habitable.
So our ancestors developed the land with\ntheir Tauros just as they did before they\r\ncame to Alola.
They kept the most fertile land as a ranch, so\nthey wouldn’t forget their gratitude for Tauros.
The history of pioneering in Alola...\c\nSince the very beginning, humans have lived\nwith Pokémon.

Ah!\nWe built such a wonderful Pokémon League!\c\nI’m one of the builders of this Pokémon League.\nIs it OK to tell you a story rather passionately?
...Sorry, you’re about to challenge very crucial\nbattles... You must be very nervous.
When it was decided to build the Pokémon\nLeague, we trembled with excitement\r\nas we were going to build a big stage for battle\r\nin the Alola region for the first time!
And...we also trembled in awe as we were going\nto develop the sacred Mount Lanakila.
Professor Kukui said that building the league on\nthe sacred ground would show respect to the\r\ntapu because we will dedicate our battles\r\nto the tapu.
The professor also said that the building\nshouldn’t spoil the scenery of Mount Lanakila\c\nand asked us to build a Pokémon League that\nrespects tradition and history but, at the same\c\ntime, that has the feel of the future—a league\nthat can be built only in Alola.\c\nThat is how this amazing Pokémon League\nwas built.
I’m very honored that I was able to be involved\nin the construction of the Pokémon League!

You met the chief, didn’t you?\c\nHe likes it here and decided to live here for\na while. Do you want to know why?
Hohoho. Then I’ll keep his story secret.
We seafolk have traveled the seas around the\nworld with our houseboats.\c\nBut the chief had lived on the land just once.
He met a girl in a port town.\nShe was physically very weak.\c\nSo he would collect rare things all over the\nworld and show them to her.
One year before her passing...\c\nhe got off his boat, built a hut near her house,\nand lived there.
The house she lived in was a cute white house\nright under a big tree. A tree that looked just\r\nlike the one you can see over there.
He must pine for her whenever he sees that\ntree. That’s what I think...
Well, thank you for listening to this old\nwoman’s mumbling...
I’m old now. It may not be a bad idea to give up\nthe boat life and settle down in Poni Island.

Uh-oh... Headmaster’s gonna be so angry...

Headmaster?
I tripped, and I scattered Stardust all over the\nroom... Just when I had finished cleaning, too!\c\n...Oh, Headmaster is what we call our Oranguru.
I gotta clean up all the Stardust! But there’s\nso much, I don’t know if I can do it by myself...
I’ll help
Good luck!
Yeah, I’ll do my best! But if I can’t finish it on\nmy own, you’ll help me, right?
There is Stardust everywhere!
Thanks! Let me know when you find any\nStardust. I’ll clean it up!
The toys are covered in Stardust!
Wow, so much dust...\nGotta make it spick-and-span again!
*rummage rummage* *brush brush*\n*dig dig* *sweep sweep*
Hey, I did it! It’s all clean again!
All right, I’m gonna keep this up and make\neverything all sparkly and clean!
Stardust is all over the floor...
Oh no, there, too?! Dust goes in the dustbin!
*sweep sweep* *brush brush*\n*wipe wipe* *gather gather*
There is Stardust in the gap between the wall\nand the shelf!
Hey, you’re right! I’m gonna need to dig that out.
The window is covered in Stardust! It needs\na good polish!
Eek, the window’s a mess! I gotta put my back\ninto it and wipe it off...

I want to go home, but it won’t move an inch\nunless it loses...
Slow...
Shashasha!
Enough of your cry of triumph.\nLet’s go home, shall we?

Aaah... Seriously?\nYou still want to do staring contests?
Is there a Pokémon that can beat my Starmie...?
If there were a Pokémon that knew Tickle,\nit would be able to beat my Starmie instantly,\r\nbut that’s not...
Whoa! You...\nThat Pokémon!
Oh, wow! It knows the move Tickle, which\nlowers Attack and Defense stats by one level\r\nif it’s used in a battle!
Please please do a staring contest with my\nStarmie right now!
Sha, shashasha!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] used Tickle!
Mie...mie! Mihaha.
It’s super effective!
Wow... Starmie, the champ of staring contests,\nis being overwhelmed!

Now you’ve lost. Let’s go home.
Thank you very much.

Hey, I’m your friend Fred!\c\nI know every Trainer in the whole world,\nand I’m friends with every one of them.\c\nJust one look at a Pokémon you got in a trade\nfrom someone else, and I can tell you everything\r\nthere is to know about its original Trainer.
Do you want to show him a Pokémon that you\ngot in a trade?
I sure do
Not right now
That’s not a Pokémon that you got from another\nTrainer, friend.
Come and show me what you got when you’ve\nactually traded Pokémon with someone else.
Eggs aren’t really Pokémon, so I can’t tell you\nanything about one of them.
Let’s see... This [VAR PKNAME(0000)]’s OT is...\c\nAh! So [VAR TRNAME(0001)] was its original Trainer!\nOf course! I know [VAR TRNAME(0001)] well!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] is so kind, so nice...\c\nWhy, one time when I was lost in a cave, it was\n[VAR TRNAME(0001)] who led me to the exit and\r\nsaved me!\c\nI’ll never forget the warmth of that hand,\ntugging on mine!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] is a really handy Trainer!\c\nI busted my Ride Pager the other day, and I was\nin a real fix, when suddenly [VAR TRNAME(0001)]\r\nappeared and fixed it in a flash!\c\nThose screwdrivers were moving so fast it was\nnearly blinding!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] is a real tough nut.\c\nI saw this Hiker fall from a cliff the other day,\nand what did [VAR TRNAME(0001)] do?\r\nSpread both arms out wide and caught the guy!\c\nEven that Hiker was moved to tears by how\nstrong and tough [VAR TRNAME(0001)] was!
Did you know that [VAR TRNAME(0001)] has a real\nunusual sort of a palate for food?\c\nI’ve seen [VAR TRNAME(0001)] gobbling down Poké\nBeans right alongside Pokémon!\r\nAnd picking out just the Rainbow Beans, too!\c\nThat [VAR TRNAME(0001)] has some real\ngourmet tastes!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] is one speedy Trainer,\nyes, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0503)]sirma'am!\c\nIn the time it took me to drink down just a single\nbottle of Moomoo Milk at the Pokémon Center\r\nthe other day, that [VAR TRNAME(0001)] visited the\r\nmain desk, healed up a whole team of Pokémon,\r\nchecked out the PC, bought some Great Balls,\r\nsold a Nugget or two, and then gulped down a\r\nsteaming hot Tapu Cocoa in one go before\r\ndisappearing again as quick as you please!
That [VAR TRNAME(0001)] sure has a fine voice for\na Trainer, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI happened to be standing nearby when\n[VAR TRNAME(0001)] was having a battle, see?\c\nAnd that voice—that beautiful voice—was so\ncaptivating that not just the Pokémon on both\r\nsides but even the opposing Trainer was\r\ncompletely entranced by it, and the battle went\r\nnowhere at all!
That [VAR TRNAME(0001)] is a Trainer you can\ncount on, that’s for sure!\c\nI wasn’t paying attention the other day and got\nmyself surrounded by a pack of 10 Rockruff.\r\nBoy, I thought I was done for!\c\nThen who should appear but [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\nThat [VAR TRNAME(0001)] could tell exactly which\r\nRockruff was the leader of the pack, caught it,\r\nand then went on to catch every other last\r\nRockruff till I was saved!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] has got real style—that is\nsimply undeniable!\c\nI got to see [VAR TRNAME(0001)]’s Trainer Passport\nthe other day, and that head shot! Oh!\c\nThe angle, the outfit—it was all so perfectly put\ntogether, I wanted to ask for a copy myself!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] is one serious person!\c\nI was riding around on Tauros the other day,\ndashing like there was no tomorrow, when I\r\nmust’ve dropped my wallet along the way.\c\nBut that [VAR TRNAME(0001)] picked it up and came\nafter me, miles and miles after me, to return it.
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] really smells fantastic, don’t\nyou think?\c\nEvery Pokémon and Trainer you see walk past\n[VAR TRNAME(0001)] can’t seem to help turning\r\nback for one last whiff of that sweet scent!
I hope you’ll keep taking good care of that there\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)], and be sure to think of\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0001)] when you do!

Hey, Champion! Want to know a secret?[VAR 0114(0011)]
My dad told me this back when I was a kid...\nHe said that Malie Library has a secret book\r\nhidden in it! Did you know?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Aaaand... Oh! He said the books themselves\nlead the way, just as spring leads to summer!\c\nThe first book is Springing Forth from Alola![VAR 0114(0011)]
Acerola gently pushed the book in.
Which book comes next, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Some Myriad Z-Move Notes
When Terrific Tapu Travel
Falling In with the Seafolk
Quit
All right! I was able to push the book in!\nWhich one do you think is next?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh? I can’t push the book in—I don’t think\nthat’s the right one... Uh, the first book should\r\nbe Springing Forth from Alola.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s four books... I hope we’re doing this right.[VAR 0114(0011)]
*ca-chunk*
The bookshelf moved, revealing a hidden space\nbehind it!
Oh, I get it now! Spring, summer, fall, winter...\c\nThe seasons were hidden in the titles of the\nbooks! Wow, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’re smart![VAR 0114(0011)]
There is a charred piece of paper hidden within\nthe secret space!
Hey, hey, read it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
You take the charred piece of paper and begin\nto read.
The pillager of light descended from the sky\nand shrouded the world in darkness. The\npillager took from us the beast that devours the\nsun, using the beast as its own Dusk Mane.\nA youth and the guardians together used the\c\nstones to summon the light once more. The\nbeast that devours the sun was freed from the\npillager of light, and the darkness was banished\nfrom Alola.
The pillager of light descended from the sky\nand shrouded the world in darkness.

The\nbeast that calls the moon was parted from the\npillager of light, and the darkness was banished\nfrom Alola.
This pillager of light is Necrozma, right?\nI hear the king of that time burned the books\r\nabout Necrozma so that the people wouldn’t be\r\nscared or worried...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I...I want to respect what that king decided.\nAnd he thought this should remain hidden.\c\nLet’s keep this a secret, just between us.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I guess I’ll head back to the league now.\nYou should come by, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]

Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nOh-what-oh-what am I to do?!
What’s wrong?
Don’t cry
My precious widdle Meowth is lost!
It’s so very timid and shy, so I’m sure that it\nmust be hiding someplace...
Ohhhh, my poor, poor Meowth!\nMy heart breaks just thinking about you!\r\nI want to find you and hug you and love you!
Please! Will you help me find my Meowth?!
Sure
Could I do it later?
I guess...\c\nBut when you have the time, please come back\nto help my precious Meowth in its hour of need!
You will help?!\nOh, thank you! You’re my hero!
Hssss! Mrawrrr!
Meowth is crouched beneath the car and trying\nto scare you off!
Look it in the eye
Look away from it
Hsss!
Meowth ran away!\nNow you’ve got to track it down again...
Hsss! Rwrrr! Hsss!
Meowth is cowering beneath the tree!
Meow meow!
Purr purr!
Mraw...?
Meowth crept out toward you!
Oh! My precious Meowth!\nThank goodness you weren’t hurt!
Mrawwwrrrrrr!
Oh, Meowth!\nI’ll never let you go again!
Awww, I just love to rub your cheek with mine...\nYou’re so soft, and my beard is so scratchy...
Mrawr?! Khssssss!
Meowth looks exhausted after all that loving\nfrom its Trainer...
This little rascal is always running off and\nmaking me worry!\c\nThank you for helping me find it, though,\nyoung trial-goer!
Since you were so speedy and skillful in helping\nme, I’ll be just as quick to reward you!\c\nUse this special set of mine to pick up your\npace and boost your power in battle!
Shall we head home, Meowth?\nOnce we get there, we can cuddle even more!
Mrawr?! Hsssssssss!!!
Oh, look how happy you are!\nHa ha ha! You adorable little rascal!
Mraaawwwwwwrrrrrr!!!
My Meowth loves the shadowy spaces under\ntires and beneath trees...\c\nOh, where could it have gone...
You’re looking for a Meowth?\c\nI saw one go dashing toward that car a little\nwhile ago...
A Meowth went running right past me just now!
I’ve never seen a Meowth running like that!\nWhat could have got it so worked up?
Is that a Meowth’s tail I see over that fence?\nNo, it’s probably my imagination, right?

Kyur...
You see this Vulpix...? It was bullied by Team\nSkull, and now it’s scared of people...
Kurr...?
Vulpix is twitching its nose, as if it’s trying to\nsmell you...
Oh...? That’s the first time I’ve seen it go up to\nsomeone on its own like that...\c\nMaybe it senses something special about you.
Vulpix seems to calm down when you’re around,\ntoo. Do you think you could come and visit us\r\nfrom time to time?
Oh... No, it’s OK. I shouldn’t get you tangled up\nin this, anyway...
Oh, thank you! Did you hear that, Vulpix?\nThis Trainer is going to help you out!
Kyuuu...
Vulpix is shaking slightly...
Do you think you could come back and visit\nVulpix tomorrow...or whenever you have time?
Oh, you’re here! It’s great to have your help.
It’s started eating the food we’ve prepared!\nI think it’s beginning to trust me, too, thanks\r\nto you!
Oh, I know! How about we all share a Big \nMalasada together? I think Vulpix trusts you\r\nenough that you could get it to try a malasada!
Oh, but you don’t have a Big Malasada...\nYou can get them at the malasada shop.\c\nDo you think you could pick one up?
Hey, Vulpix... Did you have fun?
[~ 16]
[~ 17]
[~ 18]
Vulpix began eating the Big Malasada, little\nby little!
Kruu...
We did it! It’s eating the malasada!\nThis is thanks to you!
Kyun!
It can play outside now, too. At this rate, it\nwon’t be much longer, Vulpix...\c\nWe had a lot of fun today, so we should rest.\nThere’s more fun to be had tomorrow!
It may still take some time before it’s really OK\nwith being outdoors, though...
[~ 25]
Now, if only it could play outside, without\ngetting intimidated by those Team Skull bullies...\c\nWhat should we do?
Let’s go play!
I’ll protect it!
Oh, good idea! I bet Vulpix will be much more\ncomfortable with you around. Let’s go!
Kyu!
Vulpix seemed like it was having so much fun!\nIts white fur got all muddy!
[~ 32]
[~ 33]
[~ 34]
We’re going to go to the snowy mountain... It’s\nwhere Vulpix is most at home.\c\nDon’t worry, I’ll protect it until it can defend\nitself. You have to visit us sometime!
Kruu!
Oh, did you come to see Vulpix? Just look at\nthe darling... It still absolutely loves you!
All right, Vulpix, let’s eat something. You haven’t\neaten a decent meal in a long time!
Vulpix is doing so much better! I think it might\nbe time we take it back to the white mountain\r\nit loves so much.
Kyuu...
Oh... Maybe it’s sad to say good-bye?
I’ll see you again
Don’t worry!
Kyurr...
Vulpix jumped into your arms!
Kruu!
Vulpix snuggled with you to its heart’s content...
You gave the Big Malasada to Vulpix...
I saw those Team Skull bullies picking on\na poor Pokémon again!\c\nThey never listen, even if I tell them to stop...\nYou’re a strong Trainer, right? Maybe you can\r\nteach them a lesson if you see them...

The Three Little Trial-Goers\n\nIt’s a game book where you get to take part!\nAs you read, make your own choices to shape\nthe story and the adventure as you like!
Would you like to give the book a read?
One day, Pikachu, Pyukumuku, and Slowpoke\nwere busily readying their things to set out on\ntheir island challenge.\n“Hey, hey! What do you guys think we should\nbring with us when we set out?”
What should they bring with them?
Food
Money
Quit reading
So Pikachu spent the entire day preparing\nfood enough for everyone. There were yummy\nsandwiches, cookies, and of course a generous\nhelping of Berries! Finally, the only thing left to\ndo was to pack them all safely in a basket.
After finding a good basket, Pikachu headed\nback to the kitchen to start packing up all the\nfood to go...only to discover that the food had\ndisappeared somewhere!
Where could that carefully prepared feast have\ndisappeared to? Who should be questioned?
Pyukumuku
Slowpoke
“Um, Pyukumuku, do you know where all\nthe food I made went to?”\n“Oh! I’m sorry,” Pyukumuku mumbled. “Some\nof the other Pyukumuku smelled all the good\nfood, and a few—or 10—of them stopped by...”
“They were all around me, drool dripping from\ntheir mouths, and I just couldn’t stand it! So I let\nthem eat it.”\n“You did?! I mean, I’m glad if they liked it, but\nnow I’ve got to make everything again...”
Oh boy...\nAnd so, once again, the trio failed to set out\non their island challenge this day. Perhaps their\ntime will come someday!\n                                          THE END
“Um, Slowpoke, do you know where all\nthe food I made went to?”\nSlowpoke grinned and said, “Sure do! And it\nwas delicious, by the way. Boy, I’d say it was as\ngood as a Slowpoke’s own tail!”
“Well, thank you for the compliment! But now\nI’ll have to make food for our island challenge\nall over again,” Pikachu said, with a small sigh\nof frustration.
And so all three of the Pokémon brought out\ntheir savings and pooled their money for\ntheir journey.\nJust then, there was a knock at the door.\n“Oh! We must have a visitor!”
Who should go to answer the door?
Pikachu
Pikachu went to check the front door. When\nhe came back, Slowpoke asked, “So who was it\nat the door?”
Pikachu shifted uneasily from foot to foot,\nlooking sheepish.\n“It was a traveling salesman. I’m sorry, but I...\nI spent all of our money!” he explained in a rush.
“The salesman said that this was the last\npiece of Pikanium Z he had in stock, and...and\nI’m always using that old Electrium Z I have, so\nI really, really wanted it!”\n“You spoiled little stinker!”
With all of their savings spent, the trio had to\nput aside their plans for an island challenge\nand focus instead on finding part-time work.
Pyukumuku pulled the door open, asking,\n“Yes? Who is it?”\n“I heard you three were thinking to go on an\nisland challenge, so I came to give you a bit of\nadvice!” It was Delibird standing at the door.
Pyukumuku was delighted. “Mr. Delibird!\nWe would absolutely love your advice!”\n“Lovely! It will only cost you a mere $200!”
Should Pyukumuku pay Delibird the $200?
Pay
Don’t pay
Pyukumuku handed over the $200.\n“Then here is my advice for you! If you have\n$200 to spare, use it to buy yourself a Potion!\nBuy a whole ton of Potions, in fact. Journeys can\nbe a dangerous thing.”
And Delibird gave Pyukumuku three Potions\nfrom his own stock.\n“Here is a special present to you for listening\nto my advice!”\nPyukumuku was delighted with the gift.
With a good stock of items to keep them well,\nthe trio was finally ready to set out on their\nisland challenge. Their preparations were a\ngreat success!
When you are out on your island challenge,\ngentle reader, perhaps you will see this plucky\ntrio somewhere and smile!\n                                          THE END
Pyukumuku turned down Delibird’s offer for\nadvice, saying, “Oh, that’s all right... I reckon\nwe can think things through and get ready all\non our own.”
The trio talked together about what they\nthought they would need for their journey.\n“We’re still pretty little, so I bet we’ll get real\nsleepy when night comes around. Maybe we\nshould get an Awakening to keep us alert?”
“Then let’s go shopping!”\nAnd the trio set out at once to go to the shop.\n“Um, please give us as many Awakenings as\nwe can buy with this!” they called out to the\nshop clerk.
When they left the shop, though, Pyukumuku\nwas staggering beneath the weight of so many\nAwakenings—and she tripped and fell!\n“Ow! Ow-ow-owww!”\nShe was badly hurt!
“We don’t have anything to help with injuries!\nWe should have bought Potions instead...”\nWith little other choice available to them, the\ntrio returned home for the day.
Slowpoke opened the door, and standing on\nthe other side was a very hungry Munchlax.\n“I’m starving! Don’t you have anything to eat?”\nMunchlax asked.
Slowpoke replied, “We were planning to buy\nfood on the road, so we don’t have anything\nat the moment.”\nWhen he heard this, Munchlax took a step\ninside, moving closer to Slowpoke...
“You know...you smell pretty tasty, Slowpoke.\nThat tail of yours—and really all of you—looks\nso glossy and juicy and...”\nMunchlax swallowed, licking his lips as he\ntook another step closer.
“Gahhh! Don’t eat me! J-just keep away from\nme, and I’ll get you some pizza or something!”\nAnd so Slowpoke hurried off in a rush to order\na whole pile of pizzas to treat Munchlax.
Although it hadn’t been in the plans, they all\nhad a good time with their impromptu pizza\nparty as Munchlax and the trio used up every\nlast bit of savings they had.

Oh! Hello there!\nYou’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nI have a request to ask of a Trainer.\nWould you mind having a battle with me?
Sure, I could battle you
Sorry, not right now
Ah. Right, of course...\c\nNo, it’s completely my fault.\nI’m sorry for stopping you like that.
Oh, that’s wonderful to hear!\nMy name is Meredith.\r\nI’m an aspiring actress, you see.\c\nI’ve been imitating the various styles of Oricorio\nto work on portraying different characters.\c\nSo, if you don’t mind a little demonstration...\n*ahem*
All right! Let’s go!\nMeredith is here to get this party pumped!\r\nI’ll be cheering for us both to do our best!
[~ 6]
Yup! That was my Pom-Pom Style performance,\ndemonstrated in battle!\r\nI think I really get that kind of character now!
Thanks a lot for this!\c\nAll right...\nI’ve got to go find some more styles to study!\c\nAlola!
Oh! Hi again!\nIt was [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nDo you perhaps remember me?\nI’m Meredith, the aspiring actress!\c\nDo you think I could trouble you for another\nbattle today?
Oh! Well, of course you would say that...\nYou’re busy, too, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nSorry for troubling you...
Oh, thank you!\c\nThen I’ll try to take you on with a different\nstyle this time...\c\nSo, if you don’t mind a little demonstration...\n*ahem*
Alooo-laaa!\nBreathe in nice and deep and slow...\c\nLet the wind guide your body’s movements...\c\nFeel the rhythm of the earth through you...\c\nAnd relax, and relax, and...
[~ 13]
Thaaank you so much...\c\nThat kind of leisurely battle, moving in time to\nthe rhythms of the earth, really helped me to\r\nunderstand the Pa’u Style...
Thanks a lot for this!\c\nAll right...\nI’ve got to go find some more styles to study!\c\nAlola!
Oh! Hello, hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIt’s me again, the aspiring actress Meredith!\c\nI was hoping that I could ask you for another\nbattle again today!
Oh, yes, of course.\nI’m sorry!\c\nBut maybe some other time, if you don’t mind?\nThanks, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Oh, wonderful!\nThank you!\c\nI think you know what to expect by now, but\nI’ll try another style on you again today!\c\nSo, if you don’t mind a little demonstration...\n*ahem*
Hah! So you’ll be my opponent today, will you?\nMagnificent!\c\nThen let’s see if you can set our hearts aflame!\nTry to make me and Oricorio burn for you!
[~ 20]
Heh heh heh...\nThat was quite the battle!\c\nThat kind of passionate battle was exactly what\nI needed to really nail down the Baile Style!
Thanks a lot for this!\c\nAll right...\nI’ve got to go find some more styles to study!\c\nAlola!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI was so sure I’d meet you here!\c\nIt’s me, Meredith!\nThe Trainer who hopes to be an actress!\c\nNow my journey to learn the styles needed to\nperform different roles is nearly at an end.\c\nSo please! Do me the favor of battling me just\none more time, in my latest style!
You really have a lot of responsibilities, too,\ndon’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nBut I’m really glad that you took the time even\nto stop and talk to me!
Oh, I’m so glad!\c\nThen I won’t waste any time!\n*ahem*
Good [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirlady, I would be delighted if you would\nagree to have a battle against me.\r\nSo, if you please...\c\nHave at me!
[~ 27]
My thanks to you, sweet [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou were so ruthless in that battle that I was\ngiven a perfect opportunity to test my Sensu\r\nStyle performance under true pressure.\c\nNow then...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nThank you for helping me all these times!\c\nI will definitely use the experience you have\nhelped me gain and become the kind of actress\r\nthat can take on any role!\c\nHere! This is just my way of saying thanks!
Heh heh... I’d really love to give you an\nautograph or something, but I’ll have you wait\r\nuntil I’m really famous before giving you that!\c\nAfter all, we will surely meet again, right?
Let’s both do our best toward our dreams!\nAlola!

You should really see this place during the day.
Oh! You’re a trial-goer?\nI did my own island challenge once, long ago!\c\nHey...\nWhy don’t you come here with me a moment?
When you see a rainbow like this, it’s a good\nidea to pray that your journey will go well.\r\nIt will bring you good fortune.
This isn’t the typical sort of rainbow, like the\nones you see when the rain lifts, but I think it’ll\r\nstill be effective.\c\nI’ll be sure to offer up a prayer on this rainbow\nfor your success on the island challenge.
I’ll be praying on that rainbow that your journey\nis full of good things.

Hey, hey, did you know? There’s a secret about\nthe flowers in the water bowl!
I’m interested!
Not interested
If you ever want to find out the secret of the\nflowers, I’ll be happy to tell you!
If you’re curious about the secret of the flowers,\ncome back in the morning!
You see, the flowers...
Kyuuuuuuuuumf!
Comfey floated some flowers on the water...
As you saw, they belong to Comfey! They have\na healing effect, so they’re great to have in a\r\nPokémon Center!
It always brings flowers in the morning, to help\nheal everyone who comes here!
Thanks!
That’s great!
Kyuuuuuuuuumf!
Oh! Come on, Comfey! Just because your Ability\nis Triage doesn’t mean you can go ahead and\r\nheal other people’s Pokémon! That’s my job!
Kyumf...
The Ability Triage gives priority to your\nPokémon’s healing moves!
Comfey is so caring, it uses Floral Healing the\nmoment any Pokémon are near, just in case!

There is one more hotel on Akala Island, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss.\c\nI leave it up to your exquisite tastes to judge\nwhich of the two offers the most delight.\c\nMe? I prefer the Tide Song Hotel. I interviewed\nfor a job at that other place and got rejected.
Sigh...
Ask what’s wrong
Leave him be
Are you worried about me?\nThat’s very sweet of you.\c\nYou see the truth is...well...\c\nI know I said I like the Tide Song best, but I still\ncan’t seem to let go of my dream of working at\r\nthe Hano Grand Resort.
It is, of course, delightful to work here at the\nTide Song, and I know I’m lucky to be here.\c\nYet I can’t help also wanting to experience\nworking someplace a bit more glamorous...\c\nBut I’d feel like I let down the owner of the Tide\nSong if I left now to apply to the Hano again.
Greetings, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.\c\nIs there something the matter, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss?\nAnything that I might assist you with?
And so you told the owner of the Tide Song\nabout the Bellhop’s worries.
Hah! Is that so?\nI had no idea he had so much on his mind.
Traveling Trainer, if I might ask of you a favor?\c\nIf you happen to have a Magmar among your\nPokémon, would you be so kind as to show it to\r\nmy troubled employee?
Will you show the Bellhop your Magmar?
You called Magmar from its Poké Ball in front\nof the Bellhop.
Wha—! That was a Magmar!\nBut why would you...
Oh, never mind that!\nListen! You’ve reminded me of something!
When I first set my heart on becoming a Bellhop,\nit was my mother who cheered me on.\c\nYes, my dear old mother...who looks just like\nthat Magmar there.
“When you become a Bellhop, you will be the\nface of the hotel—the very first person that\r\nguests see when they arrive at the hotel!\c\n“Be sure that you do it right!”
That’s what she told me.
I am so sorry that I let a valued guest like\nyourself overhear me sighing like that!\c\nI am going to do my utmost to be the best\nBellhop I can be, right here at the Tide Song!
That is a token of my thanks to you!
Thank you very much.\c\nI will see that he works his hardest and hones\nhis skills until you’ll hardly even recognize him!
I’d meant for him to remember how he felt when\nhe first started out, and to try again for that job\r\nat the Hano Grand Resort if he wanted, but...\c\nI must admit that I’m grateful to see he is so\nmotivated to do his best here with us.
Good day, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.\nPlease enjoy your stay.

Hey, did you know? This place is inspired\ndirectly by the Kanto region, the main scene\r\nof Pokémon Gyms!
I hear it’s a perfect re-creation of a famous Gym\nin Vermilion City! Those Kanto folks sure know\r\nhow to show people a good time!

Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
I hear this Gym is just full of the owner’s fond\nmemories of the Kanto region.
All these trash cans in this room...\nThey give it a mysterious feel, don’t they?
Oh, well done, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0503)]sirmadam! You’ll be the Kantonian\nin no time, I’m sure!

Hey, you little tyke! It may not be very smart to\nchallenge me, but it takes guts!\c\nI will be your final entertainment for today, with\nmy authentic, Kanto-style Pokémon battle!

Hey, hey! Do you know?\c\nRecently, ghosts have been appearing in the\nTrainers’ School.
Everybody got scared, and nobody will even go\nnear the school at night.
I hope someone—like a Pokémon Trainer who is\nstrong enough to be acknowledged by the\r\nisland kahuna—will solve the mysteries!
Hey, hey! It’s big news!\c\nThe seven mysteries at the Trainers’ School\nall turned out to be misunderstandings!
That’s right
I know
... ... ...\n... ... ...
Wha—? You’re the one who solved the\nseven mysteries?!
Wha—? You’re the one who solved the\nseven mysteries?!
So cool! That’s what you’d expect from a skilled\nTrainer who was acknowledged by the kahuna!
I’ll give you my treasure to thank you for\nsolving the mysteries!
But people still talk about the seventh\nghost story. It’s a mystery.\c\nAbout the student who was taken away by\na Drifloon...
I’ve heard that there is a journal from those\ndays somewhere in the Trainers’ School.
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nYou are Trainer. Great.\nHelp me.
Everyone scared. At night. School.\nThere are rumors, seven mysteries.\c\nYou check for me. You solve!\n
Kyukyu!
Please. OK?
Leave it to me!
Not now...
Thank you! I’m happy!
No? Sad...\nCome back when you can.
Seven mysteries...\nWhich one you listen?
Stairs to nowhere
Scary PA system
Lord Slimy
Scary lights
Cursed diary
Ghosts’ class
What’s number seven?
Quit
Stairs to nowhere...\c\nNight, stairs, cursed.\nYou go up and up, but still same place.\c\nYou can’t go down, either.\nCircle, circle. Can’t go back.
Scary PA system...\c\nAt night, teachers’ lounge, second floor.\nYou hear broadcast from beyond grave.\c\nYou’re done for if you hear it.\nYou can’t leave. It’s over for you.
Lord Slimy...\c\nAt night, you hear strange sound.\nSlimy, slimy—getting close.\c\nFootsteps of Lord Slimy...\nIf you’re found, Lord Slimy swallow you.\c\nYou’re gone.
Scary lights...\c\nAt night. Near burning place.\nScary lights show up and wander.\c\nBurning. Someone burning and crying.\nYou hear girl’s voice.
Cursed diary...\c\nIt appears on the shelf, third floor.\c\nKeep reading, and scary thing happens.\nIf you finish reading it, someone take you away.
Ghosts’ class...\c\nAt night, classroom, second floor.\nYou hear laughter.\c\nGhost are taking a class, too.\nEveryone says so.
Seventh story. I don’t know.\nI’m very sorry...
Please solve!\c\nBut careful...\nYou in danger. I’m sad.
Stairs to nowhere. You solved?\nYou great! Very great!\c\nHmmm...\nI know now...\c\nGastly’s prank it was...\nPaper on board was hint! I see!
Scary PA system. You solved?\nEverybody happy now! Thank you!\c\nHmmm...\nYes...\c\nSpeaker was broken. Yes, yes.\nIt was not a scary thing. Good!
Lord Slimy. You found out?\nGreat! How? What?\c\nHmmm... ... ...\n...I see...\c\nCleaning Grimer...\nIf you look closely, not scary!
Scary lights?\nYou were not scared? You OK?\c\nHmmm...\nOh...\c\nBurned love letters... That all?\nWe made mistake...
Cursed diary...\c\nHmmm...\nNow I know.\c\nIt’s Drifloon’s prank!\nMy Drifloon always makes prank, too.
Kyukyuuun!
It took my hand...\nPull me...\c\nMaybe is lonely?\nThat why it does?
Ghosts’ class. You solved?\nYou so smart!\c\nHmmm...\nYes, yes...\c\nHypno’s trick...\nBut it remember me. That is happy...
Other ghost stories.\nPlease solve...
You, great! Very great!\nSeven mysteries. You solved all!\c\nNo more scare. Great!\nThank you. Thank you.
Great. I love school.\nIf everyone scared, I’m sad.\c\nSo I give this to you.\nMy treasure. Drifloon gave it to me.
School, everyone, very kind.\nI came from far away. Here.\c\nLanguage different. I was in trouble.\nBut I came to school.\c\nEveryone good. I love everyone.\nI want to protect school. Great.
Kyukyuuu!
The girl and Drifloon look happy...
Hey! You over there!\nWhat are you doing this late at night?
He seems to be the school’s security officer.
The girl and Drifloon disappeared...
What’s wrong?
The girl...
Drifloon...
Hahaha. Seven mysteries, right?\nEverybody talks about them.\c\nBut you were alone.
Now I’ll wrap up my patrol.\nYou go home now!
Come back at night again...\nThe seven mysteries will happen...

I should burn...such things...\nYes, I should burn...all of them...
*shriek shriek*\nWh-who are you?
You told her the rumor about the\nseven mysteries...
Wha—? Am I one of the seven mysteries?\nAre you kidding?! No way!
I just... I just wanted to burn some letters...\nI was just burning them secretly.\c\nDid the flames make people think that it\nwas some kind of spirit or something?
I wrote love letters for the person I like and\nwanted to give them to him.
But he already...\nSo...
So you burned them?
Are you really OK with that?
You don’t understand how I feel!\c\nTake this! The heartbroken power of a girl\nwith a fragile heart!
*sob sob* I lost the Pokémon battle and also\nthe battle of the heart...
You still have hope
Don’t give up!
Eh? That’s the nicest thing anyone has ever\nsaid to me...

That’s right! My love won’t burn out.\c\nThanks to you, I feel much better now.\nThank you!

Normally, I leave all the cleaning to this hard\nworker, Grimo, but today we have to clean\r\nthe lockers as well, so...
See. With these cute hands, he can’t open\nlockers, right?

March 2\nMoved into a new house.\nIt’s a very spacious house.\nThe rent is cheap. Wonderful.\nWhat a great deal! I’m so lucky!

There is a bottle on the ground with a relatively\nnew-looking letter inside of it...\c\nWill you open the bottle?
To whoever is reading this letter,\n\nI would be very grateful if you could deliver this\nletter to Nainoa, a Trainer on Ula’ula Island of\nAlola. He should be at Malie City’s cape.
And if you could challenge him to a Pokémon\nbattle, you would be doing me a favor. I would\ngo myself, but I figured you could get him\nwarmed up for me! ...Just kidding, of course.
Huh? Who are you? You need something?
You tell him about the letter you found on\nUla’ula Beach...
Th-this...this is a letter from Arabella!\c\nHe’s challenging me to a battle?!
I know you only found the letter and don’t have\nanything to do with this whole thing, but please!\c\nYou have to battle me!
Well, OK, but you have to battle me when you’re\nready! You have to!
Great, I’m glad you understand! All right, let’s\ndo this!
Arabella took me under his wing when I was\nback in Kanto... He’s a Trainer at a famous Gym\r\nin that region, and I always looked up to him...\c\nBut recently I’ve been in a slump, and it became\nharder and harder for me to write him...
So I guess he wanted to reach out to me, even if\nit meant throwing a bottle into the ocean...\c\nIt’s so silly, right? The letter could have just\nbeen lost, and I’d never know...
Sorry you had to get mixed up in this, but I gotta\nadmit, I’m glad I was able to battle you!\c\nHere, take this! You deserve something for\nyour trouble!
Maybe it’s not too late for me to do an island\nchallenge... Y’know, to become a Trainer like\r\nArabella. Then I could visit him in Kanto and\r\nshow him how strong I’ve gotten!
Do you want to read the letter in the bottle\none more time?

Please!\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.[VAR 0114(004D)]
Really?! Oh, thank you so much![VAR 0114(004D)]
Right, then let’s get started.[VAR 0114(004D)]
So, Tapu Bulu!\nIs it true you’re responsible for destroying\r\nthe Thrifty Megamart here?![VAR 0114(004D)]
Bulu-lu.
Bulu-lu... I see...\nYou’re being evasive about this...[VAR 0114(004D)]
Very well, we’ll leave that topic for now.\nBut I do have another question for you!\c\nHow do you feel about the people living here?[VAR 0114(004D)]
Bu-lu-lu!
Hmm, bu-lu-lu... Interesting... I assume that\nmeans it’s hard to describe your feelings.[VAR 0114(004D)]
Bu-lu-lu!
What?! Bu-lu-lu?! What exactly do you mean\nby that, Tapu Bulu?![VAR 0114(004D)]
Bulu...
Tapu Bulu returned to its Poké Ball, trembling\nwith frustration!
Aww, what a drag!\nI had more questions to ask![VAR 0114(004D)]
But still, thanks! I should be able to write\nan interesting article![VAR 0114(004D)]
Here’s your payment for the interview.\nGo on, take it! You’ve earned it![VAR 0114(004D)]
Let’s see, what would be a good headline...\c\nA Truth Obscured?! Is Tapu Bulu’s Nature\nActually Careful?![VAR 0114(004D)]
How does that sound?!\nOoh, I wish I could ask more questions![VAR 0114(004D)]
Now! I need to get back to the office and\nstart writing![VAR 0114(004D)]

I wonder if we’ll get to meet again tonight...\nOh, I can’t wait until the sun goes down!
Alola! It’s such a beautiful night, isn’t it?\nWould you like to see something fantastic?
Sure, I’m not here to force anybody.
Then come this way...\nIt’s better if you crouch down, too.
...See that?
What do you think that is?
The correct answer is that it’s the light of the\nWing Fish Pokémon, Finneon!
They store up light from the sun during the day,\nthen let their tail fin patterns all glow at night!
If you want to see them again ever, feel free\nto stop by. I can make any night a special night.
Are you here because you wanted to see the\nlight of the Finneon again?
They just glow like this, night after night,\nwhether anyone is here to see it or not.
Seeing that pure dedication makes me feel like\nmaybe I should try a little harder, too.

Hi, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWhat a coincidence![VAR 0114(001C)]
The Machamp I call upon as a Ride Pokémon\nreally loves training, so we sometimes come\r\nhere together.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Yah![VAR 0114(0045)]
Great! That is the right amount of load for\nthe muscle![VAR 0114(001C)]
Mmmmmm!![VAR 0114(0045)]
Lifting a heavy object!\nThat is, the change in potential energy!\c\nThe science you can learn from the muscles\nis inspiring![VAR 0114(001C)]
Yeah. I should train sometimes, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hm! Hm!\nHm! Hm![VAR 0114(001C)]
*sigh* Of course, Machamp is stronger\nthan me.\c\nWell, let’s call it a day.[VAR 0114(001C)]
The Masked Royal is really great.\nHe could lift me quite easily.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Yah![VAR 0114(0045)]
Are you satisfied?[VAR 0114(001C)]
All right. See you again![VAR 0114(001C)]

I really would love to see that Pokémon with\nmy own two eyes, you know...
You know! It’s that rare Electric type one.\nThe one that looks like three Pokémon stuck\r\ntogether. Oh, what’s its name again...?
It’s that one that can even poison Steel-type\nPokémon.\c\nAnd only females can evolve into it...\nOh, what’s its name again?
I’ve heard it’s not even a Dragon type in other\nregions! You must know the one I mean!
Oooh, but the name...\nIt’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t recall it!
You know the one, though, don’t you?\nI’d love it if you could show me a specimen.
Th-that Pokémon you have there!
That’s it...\nMagneton! That’s the name!
That’s it...\nSalazzle! That’s the name!
That’s it...\nExeggutor! That’s the name!
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, it really is stuck together, isn’t it?
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, that curvaceous form is really rather\r\nartistic, wouldn’t you say?
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, it’s much longer than I expected!
Here’s a little thank-you gift!
It was so frustrating to not be able to remember\nthe name. But that’s all better thanks to you!\r\nI’ll remember you the next time I’m stumped!
I feel like my memory has really improved a lot\nthanks to your help. I appreciate it!

Grrr...[VAR 0114(0030)]
This is Tigrudo, the pro wrestler Incineroar!\nHe’s been in a slump lately, though...\r\nWanna hear about it?
Until recently, Tigrudo here was undefeated.\nThe place was always jam-packed to the\r\nrafters for his matches!
But now he’s been losing to an up-and-coming\npro wrestler, Machamp. It looks like Tigrudo is\r\nstarting to lose his mojo.
Mraow...[VAR 0114(0046)]
If only he had the TM for Acrobatics, maybe\nhe’d stand a chance against the\r\nFighting-type Machamp.
Would you look at that? You’ve got the TM for\nAcrobatics right there, don’t you?!
You can use a TM as many times as you want,\nso would you use it on Tigrudo?
Sure
I’d prefer not to
Great, thanks!
Tigrudo learned Acrobatics!
Roooaarrr![VAR 0114(0046)]
All right! Looks like he’s ready to go now!
Here, let me give you something to\nsay thanks.
Time to practice until he perfects Acrobatics!\nIt’ll be a beauty!
Grrroooooarr![VAR 0114(0046)]
Chump...[VAR 0114(0030)]
This is Macho ’Mon, the pro wrestling Machamp!\nHe’s been going through some hard times\r\nrecently, though. Wanna hear about it?
Macho ’Mon was a real up-and-comer! He was a\nwrestler who was a once-in-a-century talent.
Lately, though, he keeps losing to the crafty\nveteran pro wrestler Incineroar.\r\nIt looks like he’s starting to lose his mojo.
Meh-chump...[VAR 0114(0045)]
If he only had a Coba Berry, he’d be able to\nhang in there when he gets hit by Acrobatics\r\nfrom Incineroar.
Would you look at that? You’ve got a Coba Berry\nright there, don’t you?!
Would you let Macho ’Mon have that\nCoba Berry?
That’ll be a big help!
You gave Macho ’Mon the Coba Berry!
MACHO![VAR 0114(0045)]
All right! Incineroar’s Acrobatics are no big\ndeal anymore!
Time to learn his spots so he can make the\nmost of that Coba Berry!
CHAMP![VAR 0114(0045)]
Tigrudo and Macho ’Mon have a great rivalry\nnow, pushing each other to the limit!

Muke...[VAR 0114(0030)]
The Pyukumuku is gazing sadly out over the\nocean waves.
Don’t you think that Pyukumuku there is feeling\na bit down in the dumps?[VAR 0114(0040)]
His name is Mukeo.\nAnd he’s lost his Mukiet...[VAR 0114(0040)]
His beloved Mukiet was flung out to sea one\nday by a part-time Pyukumuku chucker.[VAR 0114(0040)]
And ever since that time, he’s been just like\nyou see there... Always staring at the sea...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Muuuke...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Maybe it’s because he reminds me of myself...\nI really sympathize with how he must feel.[VAR 0114(0040)]
Maybe Mukiet has been washed ashore again\nsomewhere on the beach...[VAR 0114(0040)]
She’s easy to recognize because she always\ncries “O Mukeo, Mukeo!”\r\nIf you don’t mind...I hope you’ll help look for her.[VAR 0114(0040)]
O Mukeo, Mukeo![VAR 0114(0030)]
That cry... Could it be Mukiet?\nShould you take this one to Mukeo?
Mukiet!!![VAR 0114(004B)]
*sniffle*\nOh, I’m so glad... I’m so happy for you, Mukeo...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Even if there are people in this world who chuck\nPyukumuku away, there are also those who will\r\ngently lift them up, as well...[VAR 0114(0040)]
I’m just so moved by this whole experience.\nYou have to let me give you this.[VAR 0114(0040)]
Mukeo... Mukiet...\nBe happy...for me, too...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Woo-hoo! Pyukumuku![VAR 0114(003E)]

Who Wants to Be a Game Creator?\n\nIt’s an interactive adventure book!\nAs you read the book, choose what you’d like to\ndo, and create a story!
Would you like to read the book?
The time is now! I’ve finally made up my mind\nto become a game creator!\nMy heart is full of excitement and anticipation\nfor the future!
Right! It’s time for me to head outside and\ntake my first steps toward becoming a\ngame creator!
Where should I go?
Quit reading
To the ocean
To the mountain
To the town
The ocean is so vast! I feel as if my heart is\ngrowing, too!\nWhoa! There’s a huge splash offshore.
There’s a huge splash!\nWhat should I do?
Fish
Swim to get closer
I lifted my fishing rod and swung it down\nstraight, just like throwing a Poké Ball!\nThe lure flew beautifully. It’s a perfect cast!
*splash splash splash* \nIt’s huge!\nBut I still managed to haul it up. Woo-hoo!\nWhat jumped out of the water was a big\nMantine...with...a guy on its back!
“Ho ho! I was watching you! \nYou’re pretty good at fishing!\nNow, I have a proposition.\nWhy don’t you come with me and\nbecome the best fisher in the world?”
I looked the man straight in the eyes\nand answered!
Yes! I’ll do my best!
I have another dream...
Several years later...\nI became a full-fledged fisher!\nI keep a tight hold on my fishing rod and fish\nthroughout the vast oceans of the world!
This is not the dream I set out to live,\nbut I am living my life to the fullest.\nI feel happy every day!\n\n                                         THE END
“That’s too bad, but I hope you can make your\ndream come true.”\nHe turned around and disappeared among the\nwaves with Mantine.
At that moment, my eyes were glued to the\nman’s movements! Those outstretched arms,\nhis comfortably bent knees, his easy, relaxed\nstance, and his flowing, waving hair.
I wanted to see his movements one more time.\nBut I never saw him again...\nI began to study the movement of the human\nbody with all my might.
Soon I became a motion designer, someone who\nmoves characters around.\nNow I can even re-create that man’s fluid\nmovements perfectly!
Yay! I made my dream come true!\nI became a game creator!\nNow, I’m going to make many great games!\n\n                                         THE END
I swam and got closer to the splash!\nThere were three women practicing\nsynchronized swimming!
One of the swimmers shouts,\n“Stop! Don’t thrash your legs about so hard!\nIn synchronized swimming, every splash,\nevery drop of water, must itself be beautiful!”
Without thinking, I responded.
I had no idea!
I want to try it!
“I’ll show you a beautiful splash!”\nAs she quickly dove into the water, dancing\ndroplets scattered beautifully around.
The droplets sparkled, shimmering in the light. I\nwas so moved that even after I’d gone home, all\nI could think of was the beauty of the droplets.
I wanted to reproduce the beautiful splash\nso much that I started intensely studying light\nand the movement of water!
I became an effect designer, who adds effects\nto video games.\nSand clouds, explosions, magic—I can make any\nkind of effect!\nIncluding beautiful splashes, of course.
A few years later...\nI became a synchronized swimmer!\nIn my next competition, I’ll be competing on the\nsame team as the woman who inspired me!
Mountains are so huge! I feel as if my very soul\nis growing taller!\nHm? Did something shine at the top\nof the mountain just now?
What is that?
Look at it with binoculars
Ask the person next to you
I held binoculars to my eyes and looked at\nthe top of the mountain!\nThe silver glimmer was coming from\na vending machine!
I climbed the mountain up to the vending\nmachine and found a sad-looking girl there.\nShe said to me, “I put money in it, but it won’t\ngive me a drink!”
A good smack is the best way to fix a machine\nthat’s stuck.\n“Hi-yah!” I slugged the vending machine.\n*clunk*\nOut dropped a Fresh Water!
“Oh wow, thank you so much! I bet you could\nbecome a Black Belt!”\nThe girl’s praise makes me giddy!
I try to hide my blushing face as I answer her.
Yeah, you bet I’ll become one!
Now, why did it break...?
A few years later...\nI have become a powerful, brawny Black Belt!\nAnd that girl promised to cheer me on at the\nnext world championship!
Come to think of it, it was the broken vending\nmachine that made the girl sad. I don’t want to\nsee her like that ever again!
I thought back to when I fixed the vending\nmachine, trying to recall every detail.\nI remember it made a beeping noise when I\nhit it, and then the Fresh Water popped out.
What was that beeping noise? If the drink\nhad just been stuck, it would not have made\nany noise like that. I began intensely studying\nthe workings of machinery!
I became a programmer. I was able to create a\nreliable vending machine that never broke, and\nit made the girl happy. Next, I want to make a\ngreat game for her!
I asked one of the ladies sitting next to me,\n“Did you see something shine up at the top\nof the mountain?”
“Oh, yes, that must be, you know, that thing.\nI mean, it is evening and all—it must have been\nflying and turned, or something.”\n...Her answer made no sense at all.
As I stood there, mystified, the lady next to the\nfirst lady stepped in to explain.\n“An airplane must have made a turn in the air\nand reflected the light from the sunset.”
The second lady’s explanation was so easy\nto understand. I bet she always has to do an\ninterpretation of what the first lady says!
In my amazement, I realized something!
Words are very important!
Interpreting seems like fun!
I thanked the second lady. But then, the first\nlady butted in.\n“Oh, but that’s what I said from the very\nbeginning, isn’t it?”
I tried to keep my annoyance hidden as I\nanswered, “Yes, of course! I’m sorry.”\nThe first lady smiled, and then they both\nwalked away together.
The second lady’s words were easy to\nunderstand, but it was my words that made\nthe first lady smile in the end. I want to learn\nhow to use both styles of words!\nI began intensely studying words and language.
I became a scenario writer. My stories aren’t\njust fun—I always try to write lines that are\neasy to understand and make people happy!
A few years later...I became an interpreter! And\nthis year, I’ll even get to work as an interpreter\nfor the Pokémon World Championships!
The town is so lively! I feel like my spirit is\nbecoming more cheerful as I walk!\n...But where am I? I think I’ve become lost!
I’ve become lost! What should I do?
Ask at the police station
Wander aimlessly
I stepped into the police station.\n“Excuse me, could you tell me where I—”\nSuddenly, I was interrupted.\nAn old man cried, “You must help me!”
The old man showed me the vase in his grasp\nas he said, “Somebody stole my precious\nvase and left this fake one in its place!”
“Please, help me, Officer!”\nThe old man seems to have mistaken me\nfor a police officer!
I tried to calm him down. I began to speak.\n“No, sir, you’ve got the wrong—”\nHe exclaimed, “Of course I have the wrong one!\nYou can tell by the sound it makes, see?”\nHe flicked the vase, and it rang beautifully!
Caught up in the moment, I blurted out...
I’ll find the culprit!
This note is F!
A few years passed. After deciding to help the\nold man on a whim, I have become a police\nofficer! I help people throughout the town and\nsolve any crime that comes my way!
The old man looked surprised and said,\n“An F note...? Th-then this must be my real\nvase! No other vase could make such a sound!”\nI asked, “So why did you think it was a fake?”
“It’s been a while since I gave it a good polish.\nThat must be why it looks so faded!\nMy mistake—sorry about the hassle!”\nThe old man wandered off, holding his vase and\nhumming to himself.
The contentedness in the old man’s humming\nfilled me with elation.\nAnd that compelling note the vase made...\nI began to intensely study sound and its\nvarious effects.
I became a sound designer! Based on my\nexperience with the old man, I have composed\nmany great themes—for mysteries, for joy, and\nof course for vases and the old man!
*pant pant*\nAfter wandering aimlessly for some time,\nI grew tired.\nSuddenly, someone shouted at me!\n“Hey there, you’re looking pathetic!”
A pretentious guy on a bicycle zipped by me.\n“I’ll bet you can’t keep up with me!” he snorted.\nHis attitude made me angry!
I chased after the guy. He continued to taunt\nme by pedaling just beyond my reach!\nWith a sneer, he said, “Oh, come on now,\nyou’ll never catch me like that!”
Finally, a bit of luck! I managed to chase him\ninto an alleyway that was too narrow for a bike!\n“OK, OK! You got me! I give up!” he said.
Feeling proud and happy, I told him...
It’s thanks to this alley!
I’m not bad on my feet, eh?
The pretentious guy and I settled our\ndifferences and shook hands on it!\nBut I must have run for 10 minutes or more!
I began thinking about the paths I just\nran through. This town had no hills, and the\nturns were all clearly marked. It was easy to\nkeep running!
I had never thought about roads that made\nrunning easy! Geography and city planning are\nreally interesting! I began studying intensely\nabout paths and how they should be.
I became a map designer! To this day, I design\nmaps, focusing on making maps that are easy\nto navigate and fun to wander around in!
A few years passed.\nHaving enjoyed my taste of pedestrian victory,\nI became a marathon runner!\nThere’s no path I won’t run on!\nThe world is my racetrack!

There are skilled Trainers aaaall over the place\nin Alola!
If you can beat them all, then maybe I’ll show\nyou my full power, too...
Skilled Trainers?
Where are they?

They’re the ones you can battle once you’ve\ndefeated everyone else in their area.

And that’s about it. Do you think you can\ndefeat them all?
Seems like you’ve defeated aaaaall of Alola’s\nskilled Trainers!
So, what do you say? Want to have a full-power\nbattle with me?
Well, that’s too bad. Let me know if you change\nyour mind.
It’s been a while since I went all out in a battle...\nThis should be fun!
Now, let’s begin the Pokémon battle!
That was a battle to make my spirit burn!\nHere’s a token of my thanks to you.
I enjoyed our battle from the bottom of my\nheart! I can’t remember the last time I had such\r\nan intense battle.
You’re definitely one of the best Trainers. I’ll\nkeep an eye on you, to see if you get better!
When held, the Life Orb causes the Pokémon to\nlose health each time it attacks, but in\r\nexchange its moves become more powerful.

Same as you, come to think of it. Always running\noff to this island, that island...
I was like that back in the day, too, y’know?\nNow, I only got time for what I like to do, though.

Thanks to you, I know what it means to be at\nfull power, now!
Woooooo!\nI’m gonna confess my feelings!!
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nI confessed my feelings at full power, but she\nwas equally full powered in her refusal...
But well, it feels good to have confessed to her.\nThanks for helping me out!
So long as you promise you’ll be back!\nI’ll be waiting!
No no no! I want to see you and your\nPokémon go all out!\c\nI’m going to keep asking until you\nshow me what I want!
Having said that, I’m all tuckered out\nfor today! I’ll see you tomorrow!

What do you think could be bothering it?\nDo you have any idea, Trainer?
It dislikes the sand’s color?
Maybe it’s lost?
Gahhh! GAHHH!!!
Sandygast started flailing about wildly!
Whoa! You’re some kind of amazing Trainer!\nYou even understand how a Sandygast feels!
You’re totally right, huh?\nAnyone can see it’s made up of different sand.
It probably doesn’t like being stuck on a black\nsand beach like this, huh?\r\nIt’s not like it’s a Shiny Pokémon after all!
Sand... Gah...
Will you take Sandygast to a different beach?
Hmmm...\nPoor Sandygast doesn’t seem very happy, huh?
Wow! You’ll help out Sandygast?\nYou’re so nice!
Oh, look!\nSandygast blends in lots better here!
Saaaaaannnd!
Sandygast looks really happy, too!\nThanks a lot, Trainer!

Heh, look at me. My heart’s still pounding!
Oh, hey, here’s a Destiny Knot. Just as a\nthank-you. I’d be happy if you keep it.
Well, I’ll see you around!

Eek! You are, aren’t you?!\nYou’re the famous star Chuuster![VAR 0114(004D)]
Chu?![VAR 0114(0043)]
You’ve become a household name with the\nmassive success of your latest film, Chuuster!\c\nSo the rumors that you were here in Alola were\ntrue after all!\c\nHow are you spending your time off?\nWhat brought you here to Alola, now?[VAR 0114(004D)]
I must ask that you respect Master Chuuster’s\nprivacy and let him vacation in peace.\r\nHe will not be taking interviews at this time.
What! But everyone is just dying to know more\nabout the famous Chuuster’s private life!\r\nYou’ve got to spill![VAR 0114(004D)]
Please, miss. We’ve already asked once nicely...
Shoo...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Step in
Walk away
You want an interview, too?\nThis is my scoop! I’m not letting you have it![VAR 0114(004D)]
Waaaaaah!\nB-but the freedom of the press—![VAR 0114(004D)]
Thank you for helping us out of that rather\nsticky situation.
Chu.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh! It seems Master Chuuster is also most\nappreciative of your assistance!
Chu.[VAR 0114(0043)]
What?! Are you sure, sir?!\nI-if you insist...
This is from Master Chuuster, for you.
Please use it wisely.
Chu-chu-chu...\nChuuu![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh! That’s it!\nThe Pikanium Z pose!!!
Lovely, sir!\nOh, it’s just exquisite!

My partner at the back is acting really\nweird lately.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Di... Di...[VAR 0114(0051)]
Dittoooo![VAR 0114(0051)]
A Ditto was disguised as my partner?![VAR 0114(0050)]
Are the Ditto Five responsible for this?[VAR 0114(0050)]
The Ditto Five love humans so much that they\ntransform into humans.\c\nThey are very troublesome![VAR 0114(0050)]
They mean no harm, but they mess up people’s\nrelationships, so they are registered as\r\nwanted Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0050)]
But where in the world did my partner go?\nBy any chance, did Ditto...?![VAR 0114(0050)]
Sorry! I had a cold and was in bed for\na while![VAR 0114(0051)]
*cough cough*[VAR 0114(0050)]
Thank you for finding out that a Ditto was\ndisguised as my partner. Take this as thanks.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Lately in Konikoni City, there are sightings of\npeople who might actually be Ditto.\c\nI’m investigating these cases.[VAR 0114(0050)]
You found out my partner was actually a Ditto.\nIt would be reassuring if I could get your help.[VAR 0114(0050)]
I see... That’s too bad.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Ditto can transform into anything.\nIt’s an amazing Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0051)]
Really?!\nOf course, I’ll reward you for your cooperation![VAR 0114(0050)]
I’ve heard that in Konikoni City, there’s a seller\nwho interacts with customers in a bizarre way.\c\nA Ditto may be involved.[VAR 0114(0050)]
[VAR COLOR(0001)]Defeat [VAR COLOR(0000)]or [VAR COLOR(0001)]catch [VAR COLOR(0000)]the Ditto.\nEither way, please report it to me![VAR 0114(0050)]
Di...Ditto-o-o-o-o?!
You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as the herb seller!
Hey, sorry for being away for a while.\c\nI was picking some herbs with Captain Mallow.
I’ll start selling herbs again.\nSo come see me!
What?! The herb seller was a Ditto![VAR 0114(0050)]
No wonder his interactions with customers\nwere bizarre.\c\nAlthough its appearance may be exactly the\nsame, it can’t speak a word.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Lately, the flavors at my favorite restaurant in\nKonikoni City seem to have changed...\c\nIt may have something to do with Ditto.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Dittottotto.
You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as a chef!
Oh no! I’m late! I’m late!
I ate too much yummy food and got stuck in\nthe door at my home.\c\nBut for some reason the restaurant is running\nall right... Was someone cooking?
What? Ditto was disguised as a chef in\nthe restaurant?![VAR 0114(0050)]
No wonder the flavors have been different\nlately. Ditto was cooking...[VAR 0114(0050)]
Lately, more and more people feel less stiff\nand tense in Konikoni City.\c\nI wonder if it has something to do with Ditto.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Didi!
You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as the lomi lomi massager!
Hmmm... Strange...
People in town are raving about their massages,\nsaying they make them feel like they’re melting.\c\nBut I was closed for a while.\nStrange...
What? The massage therapist at the lomi lomi\nmassage place was a Ditto?![VAR 0114(0050)]
So a Ditto was giving people\nlomi lomi massages?!\c\nOf course... If Ditto, with such a melty body,\ngave you a massage, the stiffness in your body\r\nwould just melt away, too.[VAR 0114(0050)]
This is not about Ditto, but lately Olivia often\ngazes at the sea alone in Konikoni City.\c\n...I wish I could be of help to her.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Ditto![VAR 0114(0009)]
You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as Olivia!
What?! The person who was gazing at the sea\nwas actually a Ditto, not Olivia?![VAR 0114(0050)]
Watching her from behind like that, with her\nsadness seeming to blow in the Alolan breeze...\c\nI was certain that was Olivia.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Thank you for dealing with the Ditto.\nThis is a reward for you![VAR 0114(0050)]
Please keep investigating Ditto!\nI’m counting on you![VAR 0114(0050)]
Wow! You managed to take care of the entire\nDitto Five![VAR 0114(0050)]
Thank you very much for your cooperation![VAR 0114(0050)]
Ditto act weird and can’t talk, so now we\ncan tell disguised Ditto from humans.[VAR 0114(0050)]
What if Ditto that can fully understand humans’\nminds appeared?[VAR 0114(0050)]
Maybe...\c\nPeople near you may have been swapped\nwith Ditto without your knowing... Haha![VAR 0114(0050)]
Oh, you!\nThank you for your patrol![VAR 0114(0050)]
I’ll give you one more gift as thanks for\nsolving the cases![VAR 0114(0050)]

The name’s Ryuki. I’m what you might call a star.\c\nI mean, with partners like my Pokémon, how\ncould I not be a star?\c\nI came all the way across the sea here to Alola\nto challenge the Pokémon Gym![VAR 0114(001A)]
But this Kantonian Gym here... This isn’t a real\nPokémon Gym. Still, I dig it here.\c\nIt’s got a feel to it, man. It’s got spirit.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hey, Trainer. I can feel your spirit, too!\nWant to have a battle with Ryuki?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hey, Champ! Why not have a battle with me?\nLet our fiery spirits clash in a blaze of glory![VAR 0114(001A)]
Sure!
No thanks!
I don’t blame you. I’m a rocker down to my\ncore, after all![VAR 0114(001A)]
Allow me to introduce my band mates!\nCome on, babies![VAR 0114(001A)]
All right! My babies were all fired up to play a\nset, but you chilled them out nicely![VAR 0114(001A)]
Once Alola gets a real Pokémon Gym, I give you\nmy word I’ll become the Dragon-type Leader![VAR 0114(001A)]
The name’s Ryuki. I’m what you might call a star.\c\nAnd now, you’re a star, too! There’s only one\nthing two stars can do—get the crowd fired up\r\nwith a blazing, rocking Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(001A)]
Hey, no encores! I pour my spirit completely into\none battle, one move![VAR 0114(001A)]
That’s right, a Dragon Scale! I’ve poured my\nspirit into it, too![VAR 0114(001A)]
Hey! You’re curious about what kind of item\nthe Dragon Scale is, aren’t you? Well, you’ll have\r\nto figure that out for yourself![VAR 0114(001A)]

Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So you’ve spotted me sticking up one of\nthese lovely stickers, have you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s a sticker?
You did what now?
Oh yes!\c\nIf young trial-goers collect these stickers as\nthey travel and follow the path they indicate,\r\nthey will quite naturally progress along their\r\nisland challenge!\c\nReally, if I had to describe them, I would say\nthese stickers really save trial-goers like you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I cannot let my guard down...\c\nThose [VAR COLOR(0001)]Team Skull [VAR COLOR(0000)]thugs have far too much time\non their hands, and they’re always trying to get\r\nin the way of Trainers on their island challenge.\c\nI have to keep an eye on them to be sure they\ndon’t take down my stickers.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve actually just had a report that Team Skull\nwas seen making trouble around town.\r\nI suppose I should go have a look.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well then, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI hope you’ll have a delightful time running\r\nabout to search out and collect Totem Stickers![VAR 0114(000C)]
You have an island challenge amulet!\nPlus Normalium Z and Fightinium Z!\c\nSo it would seem that you’ve cleared that\ntrial of Ilima’s, have you?\r\nAnd even battled Hala? Congratulations![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh! Well, hello there. Good to meet you.\nI’m Oak—Samson Oak.\c\nI’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’m looking into\nthe Totem Pokémon found around here.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Yes, Totem Pokémon...\c\nWhy are they so large?\nWhat gives them that burning aura?\r\nDon’t you find yourself wondering as well?[VAR 0114(0034)]
I do!
Not really...
Precisely my point!\nIn that case, let me tell you this...[VAR 0114(0034)]
Is that so?\c\nYou may say that now, but I think that hearing\nwhat I have to propose will change your mind![VAR 0114(0034)]
I want you to collect certain stickers for me,\nto receive a totem-like Pokémon for yourself!\r\nThat’s right. I mean the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Totem Stickers[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0034)]
You can find Totem Stickers here and there.\nPeel them off whenever you find them, and try\r\nto collect them all.[VAR 0114(0034)]
If you collect [VAR COLOR(0001)]20[VAR COLOR(0000)] Totem Stickers to show me,\nI’ll give you a fine Gumshoos![VAR 0114(0034)]
If you collect [VAR COLOR(0001)]20[VAR COLOR(0000)] Totem Stickers to show me,\nI’ll give you a fine Raticate![VAR 0114(0034)]
Don’t let me down, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nAfter all, you are the Trainer that Professor\nKukui entrusted with Rotom there![VAR 0114(0034)]
Zzzrt![VAR 0114(0035)]
I’ll be around [VAR COLOR(0001)]Heahea Beach[VAR COLOR(0000)] on Akala Island,\nif you need to ever find me!\r\nYou can reach it with a spot of Mantine Surfing.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Oh! Young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI’ve been hoping to see you again![VAR 0114(0034)]
It seems you’ve collected [VAR NUM3(0002)] Totem Stickers!\c\nI told you I’d give you a special [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\nthat’s as big as a real Totem Pokémon once you\r\ngot [VAR NUM3(0003)], so I guess it’s yours![VAR 0114(0034)]
You received [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Hrmmm... It looks like your Boxes are too full to\nexchange your Totem Stickers for this fine\r\ntotem-like Pokémon, ambitious young Trainer![VAR 0114(0034)]
So you’ve collected [VAR NUM3(0002)] Totem Sticker[VAR NUMBRNCH(0002,0100)]s...\nHunting them down is quite the task, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0034)]
The captains and Trial Guides work hard to\nstick Totem Stickers up all around Alola.\c\nSearching them out should surely help you\nprogress through your island challenge![VAR 0114(0034)]
Even after finding every last Totem Sticker,\nthat doesn’t mean the quest to understand\r\nprecisely what Totem Pokémon are, or what\r\nsource their auras derive from, will end![VAR 0114(0034)]
Why, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWe keep running into one another, don’t we?[VAR 0114(0034)]
When I’m feeling stuck with my research into\nregional variants and Totem Pokémon, that’s\r\nwhen I come out for a spot of Mantine Surfing!\r\nIt’s the secret to feeling all recharged![VAR 0114(0034)]
Though it does get my Gogoat that I can’t seem\nto ever beat that kimono-clad cad when it\r\ncomes to the ranking board...[VAR 0114(0034)]
Anyway! You keep collecting those Totem\nStickers, and enjoy your island challenge!\c\nI’ll be around [VAR COLOR(0001)]Heahea Beach[VAR COLOR(0000)] on Akala Island if\nyou ever need me![VAR 0114(0034)]

So you’re the one who caught the Zygarde\nthat appeared in Resolution Cave, Champion![VAR 0114(0027)]
We were also able to catch a Zygarde![VAR 0114(0026)]
Impressive!
Two Zygarde?
There’s something even more impressive![VAR 0114(0026)]
Correct! Two Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
The Zygarde you fought and captured in\nResolution Cave is in its 50% Forme. \c\nAnd the Zygarde we found is in what is known\nas its 10% Forme.[VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s right...50% and 10%. Zygarde can use\nvarious forms depending on the situation!\c\nIt’s quite a unique Pokémon, don’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0026)]
If you’re interested, I’ll give you the Zygarde we\ncaught. You could combine the two to see\r\nwhat will happen. But only if you can beat me![VAR 0114(0027)]
I’m up for the challenge!
I’m not ready yet
No problem. Come when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Then I’ll let my precious partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
Not only did we find Zygarde, but I also had a\nchance to battle the Champion! Coming to\r\nAlola was definitely a good decision.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Take good care of Zygarde, please![VAR 0114(0027)]
It seems like your Boxes are full, and you\ncan’t take Zygarde. Please come back once\r\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(0027)]
It’s a pleasure to meet you again, Champion.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Now, allow me to explain the Reassembly Unit![VAR 0114(0026)]
Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Assembly is...to change the Forme of\nZygarde! Now, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells!\c\nYou see, Zygarde can change its Forme by\ngathering parts of itself known as Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
To separate Zygarde...\nIt means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, I almost forgot! We need to give you the\nZygarde Cube, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
It also has the 40 Zygarde Cells we gathered.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...so then why is it in Alola?\c\nDoes it have something to do with the Ultra\nBeasts that have appeared?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Who knows...? Maybe Zygarde itself will tell\nus someday.\c\nAnyhow...we’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

This is excellent! Exciting, even! Alola is proving\nto be just full of surprises!
If a Trainer trusts his or her Pokémon, even in\nthe most extreme of situations, the Pokémon\r\ninevitably respond by unleashing their full\r\npower! Just like that Trainer I once met...
There was only one answer I could reach. And\nin Alola, that answer takes the form of Z-Moves!
I can now see with my own eyes the invisible\npower between Trainers and Pokémon...\c\nZ-Moves give it form!
The Z-Power Ring and Z-Crystals... Their\nunknown energy will open doors to new worlds!
I must know... Why did Necrozma give its light\nenergy to the Pokémon of Alola in the form of\r\nauras?! As Z-Power?!\c\nHmm... If I want to find out more about moves,\nI suppose I should ask Professor Kukui, or even\r\nthe Masked Royal! Maybe I’ll go battle them![VAR 0114(002B)]

Part of my job is getting my hands on rare\nstones to be used in our shop.

If you bring along a Pokémon that can use such\na stone, then I will give you a Z-Crystal!
Oh! You brought along a Snorlax!\nIt should be able to use Snorlium Z, hmm?
Oh! You brought along a Mew!\nIt should be able to use Mewnium Z, hmm?
Oh! You brought along a Marshadow!\nIt should be able to use Marshadium Z, hmm?
Z-Crystals really are meant to be held by\nPokémon, wouldn’t you agree?

Why, hello, Champion!\nAlola to you![VAR 0114(0008)]

Nebby...\nYou came here from very far away, didn’t you?\c\nI’m glad that I could take you with me...\nthat we got to experience that journey together.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I know this may be sudden,\nbut I hope you will consider what I ask of you.\c\nI want to entrust Nebby to you.\c\nI think Nebby should be with Necrozma.\c\nFrom what I’ve heard, Necrozma would not\nsuffer as much or ache so for the light if it\r\ncan remain close to Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I think it’d be best...if they both stayed\ntogether with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI’ve thought a lot about it and that’s what\nI decided, so...please...\c\nI want you to face Nebby as only a Trainer can.\nAnd I want you to give it a ball to call home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
La-liona-a-ahhh!!!
Mahina-a-ahhh!!!

The Champion?! You always impress me, Chief.\nIs there anything you don’t know?[VAR 0114(001F)]
It seems as if you’re in the middle of a mission.\nYou should wrap that up first. They are tough\r\nopponents, but you and your Pokémon should\r\nbe able to handle them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah, so you’re on a mission, too? I’ve got my\nhands full as well.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I plan to train at the Battle Tree, so as to be\nable to complete any assignment as a member\r\nof the International Police.\r\nUntil we meet again...[VAR 0114(0029)]
It was good to run into you, Champion!\nSadly, I only have this item called a Red Card.\r\nPlease keep it as a memento of this encounter![VAR 0114(001F)]
The Red Card forcefully switches any Pokémon\nthat lands an attack on the Pokémon holding it.\c\nBut once it’s activated, the item itself is lost![VAR 0114(001F)]
*sigh*\c\nI’d never hear the end of it from Nanu if I let\nanything happen to the chief.\c\nMy new partner isn’t very strong, but it looks\nlike I have to go to the Battle Tree, regardless!\c\nBut only as a bodyguard, of course.\nWell then, alola![VAR 0114(001F)]

What’s with that odd-looking duo? Are they\nsome kind of local celebrities or something?
You’re not allowed to ride the Mantine until your\nlegs are big and strong, so you can stand up on\r\nthem. I bet your legs get super strong from all\r\nthe walking you do on the island challenge!
Hey, they’re from Team Skull, that bunch of\nbullies! I’m not scared of the Grunts, but their\r\nboss is supposed to be really scary!
How ’bout you have a ride with Mantine Surf?\c\nYou can just flow with the wave, but it’s\nimportant to challenge yourself, too!
The Mantine are all really chill. They don’t care if\nsomeone’s riding them, or even if Pokémon\r\ncalled Remoraid cling to them!
Weeeeeeh!
Grbrbrb!
My straw hat got blown away by the wind, and...\nWell, I chased after it and wound up here.
Everyone seems able to pull off killer moves the\nmoment they climb atop a Mantine...\c\nWhy do they even keep me as an instructor?
Hey, thanks for always playing with Pyunch!\nThat’s the nickname of Pyukumuku.\c\nSince nobody needs lessons on Mantine Surf\nmoves, I’ve started teaching Pyunch instead!
If you fall off during Mantine Surf, don’t worry!\nThe Pyukumuku help you float, and I’ll fish you\r\nup eventually!\c\nOh, I’m kidding! The Mantine will always help\nyou get back up on the wave!
You can Mantine Surf at special Surf Spots!\nEnjoy surfing with... You guessed it! Mantine!

Woo-hoo, a festival! I wish every day was\na festival!

I ate every last bite of my Alola yakisoba!
Sometimes, I get this feeling...this sense of being\nwatched over by the guardian deity.
Everyone’s saying we should fix the bridge, but\nwe don’t have any good lumber!
If anyone can have a good battle that makes the\nPokémon happy, it’s Hau!
There’s only one bit of advice I can give you for\nHala’s grand trial... Give it all you have in\r\nboth body and spirit!
“Grand trial” sounds so cool! I can’t wait till I can\ngo on an island challenge with Rockruff!

Look at your Pokémon...\c\nWhether it has any claws or not now, it would\nprobably get a kick out of this one.
In Pokémon battles, the Pokémon with the\nhighest Speed stat gets to act first.\c\nBut with a Quick Claw, your Pokémon should be\nable to attack first, regardless of its Speed.\r\nOr sometimes, anyway. It’s better than nothing!
Some items don’t do anything unless you give\nthem to a Pokémon to hold.

We occasionally ask Professor Kukui to run a\nspecial class for our school.\c\nHe’s done a great deal of research into Pokémon\nmoves, after all.
Pokémon moves have PP. Um. Power Points.\c\nIf the PP for a move runs out, your Pokémon\nwon’t be able to use it anymore.\c\nNot till you get it restored, I mean. And you can\njust take it to a Pokémon Center for that!
Who do you think picks up all the Poké Balls\nyou throw that don’t catch any Pokémon?
I can read! Here, watch.\c\n“Moves have types, just like Pokémon...\c\n“If you use a move that’s the same type as your\nPokémon, it will get a special boost in power!”
Petting my Pokémon makes me happy, too!
There is writing on the blackboard.\nIt describes how types match up.\c\nGrass is weak to Fire.\nWater is weak to Grass.\r\nFire is weak to Water.\c\nThere are many more types, too, and they have\ntheir own weaknesses, just like these three.
Healing Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!

Abilities are basically special skills all Pokémon\nhave that can make special things happen.\c\nTake the Ability called Limber, for example...\c\nAny Pokémon who has that Ability won’t ever\nbe paralyzed by an opponent’s moves!
When you begin to level up as a Trainer and\nlearn advanced strategies, you’ll want to pay\r\nattention to Abilities. They can be a huge help!
All Pokémon have some sort of Ability...\c\nBut even members of the same species don’t\nalways have the same Ability as one another.\c\nWhich Ability you’ll want your Pokémon to have\nwill depend somewhat on how you like to battle.
Let’s see here...\c\nSo, if you choose to view a Pokémon’s summary,\nyou can see what Ability that Pokémon has.\c\nWhen you touch the “i” for more information,\nyou can see what that Ability does.\c\nMaybe I’d remember it all better if the textbook\nwasn’t written to be so boring!
My Lillipup picked this up.\nHere, you take it.
Lillipup’s Ability is Pickup!\c\nIt’s an awesome Ability that works even when\nyou’re not in battle.\c\nI went all the way to Akala Island to find a\nLillipup and catch it just to have this Ability.
There is writing on the blackboard.\c\nIt describes some of the physical changes that\na Pokémon can experience in battle.
What would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP\nduring battle.\c\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle\neither, so heal poisoning with an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce its HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely\nhelpless.\c\nIt may thaw out on its own, but if the battle\nends first, it will remain frozen thereafter.\c\nYou can thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
Poisoning
Paralysis
Falling asleep
Getting burned
Being frozen
Never mind
On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
An old notebook had fallen behind the\nbookshelf. Do you want to read it?
February 12\nI stayed at school playing until really late, and\nthen a Hypno appeared!\nThe new kid went home with the Hypno.\nApparently the Hypno came to pick her up?
February 21\nWe were all playing together when Drifloon came\nthis time to pick up the new girl!\nI wonder if she just caught Drifloon?\nWhat happened to Hypno though?

Slowpoke’s Yawn is a move that can put\nyour opponent to sleep in battle.\c\nWhen a Pokémon is asleep, it can’t do anything\nuntil it wakes up, so it can give you a chance\r\nagainst a Pokémon you’re having trouble with.
Ya-a-awn...

The formula to determine how much damage a\nPokémon takes from a move is written up on\r\nthe board.\c\nIt even includes calculations for the effects of\nitems and Abilities.\c\nIt looks like Professor Kukui’s handwriting.

Why is she still looking for more souvenirs?\c\nLook, it’s just like Pokémon can only learn\nfour moves at a time, right?\r\nThey can only carry one item at a time, too!

You know the festival here in Iki Town?\c\nWell, some years there are no 11-year-old kids\nsetting out to hold a sacred battle for us.\c\nThose years Hala gets to take part and we\ndedicate a bout of sacred Alolan sumo to the\r\nguardian instead!
Kahuna Hala is real strict when it comes to\nhis training.\c\nOh! Not training for Pokémon battle or nothing.\nI’m talking about his sumo training!
That Hala... He’s too soft on young Hau.\c\nWhen Hau was just a little thing, he once saw\nHala in a real fury and old Hala’s face was\r\nso terrible then that the boy burst into tears!\r\nHala couldn’t do a thing to console him.\c\nI think he’s been holding something of himself\nback in front of Hau ever since that day.
Old Hala’s training has been extra strict lately!\c\nLooks like losing to little Hau has really lit a\nfire under our old kahuna...\r\nBut he seems happier than ever about it!

Greetings, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.
You can fit absolutely anything inside of a\nTrainer’s Bag, huh!\c\nIf it was me, I’d sure like to tuck myself in a \nBag and tag along on someone’s adventure!
All right! Time to visit the ranch next!\nI’ve just got to cut through Paniola Town!
Cor! Cor!

The ocean breeze dances over Heahea\non the day I spend with you.  \c\nThe blue roofs stretch on unbreaking,\nas endless as the sea itself. \c\nThe Lumineon dance upon the waves,\nour cheeks flame like the setting sun. \c\nCome here to hear the song of sea,\nCome here to hear the song of life. \c\nI wait to welcome you anytime...\nCome to the Tide Song Hotel! 

Now that’s something you don’t see every day...\nIsn’t that a Rotom Dex?\c\nIt shows you lots of details about a Pokémon’s\ndistribution if you zoom in on the map, right?
Oh!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nI’m sorry... I saw some people who looked like\nthose Team Skull thugs and I got scared.\c\nI was trying to avoid them and then I think I\nended up missing my meeting...\c\nOh! But don’t worry. It’s fine.\nThis is actually where I wanted to be...\c\nWill you be going for another one of your trials,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nFrom what I’ve read, I think that the nearest\ntrial site must be the one up Route 4.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Giratina:\nThis Pokémon is said to live in a world on the\nreverse side of ours, where common knowledge\nis distorted and strange.

Alola is the land where I was born.\nAlola is the home I was born into.\r\nWelcome, and please feel at home as well!
A good Pokémon will listen to what others think\naround it and then discover its own mind.\r\nThe same goes for a good woman, too.
Listen, kid: If you don’t throw common sense\nout the window sometimes, you’ll never be able\r\nto discover anything new.\c\nTry everything out: different Abilities, moves,\nitems... That’s how you make a breakthrough!
I can’t make any recommendations on behalf\nof the hotel, but I can tell you this...\c\nWhatever type of Pokémon that your Pokémon\nare weak to, you should have other Pokémon on\r\nyour team that are effective against that type!
The owner of the Hano Grand Resort is a great\ngolf fan.\c\nAnd his daughter, Miss Kahili, is a world-class\nGolfer herself! And a real strong Trainer, too.

Pokémon Pop Psychology Quiz!\nYou’re exhausted at the end of the day and\njust want to dive into bed and sleep when...\na sopping-wet Pyukumuku flops up to you!
What do you do?
Ignore it and go to bed
Give it a pet, then sleep
Let it sleep in bed with you
Decide it’s time to clean
If you chose “Ignore it and go to bed”...\nYou’re the type who runs straight ahead in\npursuit of your goals, always with your eye on\nthe target! That dedication is a good thing, but\nyou may also tend to ignore others’ needs.
It’s not that you can’t appreciate how others\nfeel—it’s more like you choose not to. Try to\nbe a little more considerate of those\naround you.\nBonus: try donning a red hat for good luck! ♪
If you chose “Give it a pet, then sleep”...\nYou’re the type who is able to be considerate\nof others’ needs while also taking care of your\nown. You manage to keep just the right amount\nof perspective and balance in your priorities!
But you might have a tendency to drop the\nball at the last minute, when it really matters.\nTry to stay aware of what’s going on\naround you!\nBonus: green sneakers may help you relax! ♪
If you chose “Let it sleep in bed with you”...\nYou have a big heart, and your kind outlook\nallows you to always be considerate of others’\nfeelings. But perhaps you might be prioritizing\ntheir feelings too much over your own.
You might end up wearing yourself out doing\nthat, so try not to take everything upon\nyourself. Learn to depend on others and ask\nfor help when you need it!\nBonus: a pink bag will bring you fortune! ♪
If you chose “Decide it’s time to clean”...\nIt seems that you’re the type who can take care\nof problems without delay! You’re quick to\nresolve any situation, but if all you’re ever trying\nto do is be as efficient as humanly possible...
then it might be easy for others to mistake you\nfor being cold. Sometimes there is more to life\nthan efficiency. Try to see beyond the urge to\nsimply fix things.\nBonus: skull-patterned clothes may be lucky! ♪

The islands of Alola are all quite far apart from\none another.\c\nYou’d wear out your poor Pokémon if you made\nthem go that far. You have to take the ferry.
Shak-sheee?

The empty sky broke asunder,\na hole appearing where had been none.\nA single beast appeared from in it:\nit was called the beast that devours the sun.\c\nThe king of Alola bowed before it:\nthe beast that shone so like the sun.\nThe island guardians fought against it,\nbut in the end the beast had won.\c\nThen did the beast that devours the sun\nshine its light on the line of kings.\nThen did the beast that had won\nbring nature’s gift to bless all things.\c\nBeast of sun and beast of moon.\nThrough their union, they brought new life.\nA fragile heir in Alola born\nthat island guardians would keep from strife.\c\nThe ancient kings sang their thanks\nfor Solgaleo with song of flute.\nTwo tones rang out across the altar—\na perfect pair, ever after mute.

Alola, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nSince you’re out and about exploring on your\nisland challenge, you must already know about\r\nregional variants, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0034)]
Just as I would have expected![VAR 0114(0034)]
Indeed?\nMaybe they are rarer than I thought...[VAR 0114(0034)]
Yes, regional variants...\c\nThey arise when the influences of a particular\nregion cause a Pokémon’s physical aspect and\r\neven type to change.[VAR 0114(0034)]
If you have a local Persian—the regional\nvariant—I would quite like to see it![VAR 0114(0034)]
Oh! That’s a local Alolan Persian, all right!\c\nI’ve heard that having a round face can be\nconsidered quite cute here in Alola!\r\nMaybe that explains the Alolan regional variant?\c\nAnd since Persians are so smart even before\nthey evolve, it may be that they use the extra\r\nenergy born during Evolution to instead help\r\nstrengthen and bulk up their bodies...\c\nHow very fascinating and alluring!\c\nAnd since this regional variant Persian evolves\nonly with high friendship, I know what kind of\r\nwonderful Trainer you must be, my young friend![VAR 0114(0034)]
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet me give you something good as thanks![VAR 0114(0034)]

Oh, that cousin of mine in Kanto...\c\nHe and I look remarkably alike, or so everyone\nalways says. He’s Samuel Oak, though.\c\nHe actually is the one who gave me this\nKanto region Pokédex that I carry with me now\r\nfor comparison as I look into things here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Sam has a grandson, in fact, who is a pretty\nastounding Trainer himself. Boy’s name is Blue.\c\nI actually sent him some Z-Crystals as well,\nso who knows?\r\nMaybe he’ll come visit Alola, too, someday![VAR 0114(0034)]
What! You met my grand-nephew Blue?!\c\nWell, if that doesn’t just take the cake!\nIt’s like six degrees of Pokémon separation![VAR 0114(0034)]
Springing Forth from Alola\nI became an island challenge champion\nAnd wanted to show my vaunted skills\nIn a far-off region.\nBut those city Trainers were strong...\c\nSo, as Champion,\nIf I had just passed the time peacefully,\nI wouldn’t have had to suffer so much,\nI say, cursing myself, but I want to\nLeave my claw marks on the world—\c\nToday, too, I’ll be pushed by my partner\nTo exact revenge for yesterday.\nRise with my remaining strength...\n\nYes, springing from Alola...
Some Myriad Z-Move Notes\nThe vigor and strength of the Trainer\ncombine with their Pokémon, as they bring\neverything out of one another in a move.\nThus came the Z of Zenith.
Falling In with the Seafolk\nThe seafolk are mysterious.\nThey skillfully manipulate boats, riding\nthe waves with their knowledge of the stars,\nvisiting each region of the world.\c\nWith knowledge of every legend and riddle,\nthey onetime received a windfall of treasure.\nEven they themselves do not know\nwhere they came from\nor when they began their boat voyages.
When Terrific Tapu Travel\nThe tapu, guardian deities,\nare each thought to have made\ntheir own respective, fixed island\ninto their base.\c\nHowever, that is a recent understanding, and\nthe tapu of old were said to capriciously visit\nother islands, play with people and Pokémon,\nand then fly off somewhere else. It seemed as\nif, for the tapu, these were aimless trips...\c\nBut, while it may have\nseemed like wandering, we suspect\nthat the tapu were trying to facilitate\ncommunication between islands.

Starting a new book for the first time is like\nsetting out on a new adventure, don’t you think?
It’s only by reading some really terrible books\nthat you learn to recognize the good ones!
The Legendary Pokémon and the Tapu\nA great and terrible battle waged between the\ntapu and the Legendary Pokémon, but neither\nside could claim victory over the other.\c\nUpon finding themselves equals, the Legendary\nPokémon then gifted the tapu with great power\nof unknown providence.
The Guardian Deities of the Islands\nThe tapu regularly keep themselves closed tight\nin their shells as they absorb nature’s energy.\nAfter many long years of absorbing such energy,\ntheir shells become hard and sturdy.
The Tapu and the Island Kahunas\nThe tapu choose the kahunas of their islands\nand entrust them with special Sparkling Stones.\nWhat reasoning they use to make such a choice,\nhowever, is not at all apparent to observers.
The Guardians and the Ancient Kings\nIn ancient times, the tapu served as the leaders\nof the armies of each island’s king, but if they\nused their Z-Power in battle, it caused great\ndestruction across the islands.\c\nBecause of this, the tapu came to no longer\nlend their aid in the wars of men.

Are you a visitor? No worries. We can dig it!\nHere at the Geothermal Power Plant, we love\r\nhaving more pals to share our energy with!
The Steam Separator\c\nGeothermal reservoirs underground contain\nhigh-pressure water that has been heated up\r\nby the magma within the planet.\c\nThis device helps separate the heated fluid\nfrom the reservoirs into steam and hot water.
Regarding Steam Turbines\c\nBy directing steam to pass over the turbine’s\nblades and spin it on its axis, you can keep the\r\nturbine in motion to generate power.
The Generator\c\nThe steam turbines spin at a speed of 3,600\nrevolutions per minute, powering the generator\r\nand producing electricity.\c\nIt may seem like the generator organ in Vikavolt,\nbut it works on an entirely different principle.
The Cooling Tower\c\nThis is where the water from the steam used\nby the generator cools.\c\nOnce the water has been cooled sufficiently, it\ncan then be reused to cool more steam.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 1\c\nWith the help of digging Pokémon, scientists\nsearch for underground steam vents in the\r\narea around active volcanoes.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 2\c\nOver a long period of time, and with the help of\nmany Pokémon that can work underground,\r\nthe power plant is constructed.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 3\c\nThe steam that is naturally produced due to\nunderground heat is used to turn turbines and\r\ngenerate electricity.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 4\c\nThe Geothermal Power Plant produces clean\nenergy that is good for the environment, thanks\r\nto its relatively small carbon footprint.
There are souvenirs on sale with the Geothermal\nPower Plant’s logo, like towels and things.

What do you do?
Chomp into it raw!

You chose “Chomp into it raw!” That means...\nYou’re honest and straightforward, and you\ncan be very innocent. You’re quick to grasp\nnew concepts and not afraid to try new things.\nIn fact, you might even be a genius!
It might even feel like you’re the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0504)]kingqueen of the\nworld, but be careful! You can be so carefree,\nsometimes you make huge blunders! Don’t let\nthose bog you down, though—be who you are!\nCarry a yellow bag for better fortunes!
You chose “At least cook it”! That means...\nYou’re good at figuring out what’s possible and\nwhat’s not. You’re calm and very analytical.
But maybe you put limits on yourself without\nreally trying your best? You have so much\nhidden potential—don’t be afraid to believe in\nyourself! Stay positive by wearing some cool\norange sandals!
You chose “Make it into jerky!” That means...\nYou’re really adaptable, and you’re good at\nmaking the best of any situation. You have lofty\nideals, and you’re not afraid to work hard to\nmake them real.
It must be difficult sometimes, but your hard\nwork will be worth it in the end! But don’t get\ntoo carried away, or you could make some big\nmistakes! Your lucky item is a pair of\nswanky sunglasses!
You chose “I’d never eat it”! That means...\nYou follow what you truly believe in, no matter\nwhat anyone tells you. But sometimes you can\nbe a little bit too stubborn.
Try listening to those around you from time to\ntime... Who knows? It may open doorways to\nnew worlds! If you can find any slightly torn\nclothing, that will help bring you opportunities!

When Pokémon are injured in the wild, they\ntend to hide themselves away somewhere.\c\nThat is so that they can recover in a place\nwhere they’ll be safe from further harm.\c\nBut sometimes they need more care than that.\nWe search them out and care for them so that\r\nthey don’t lose their lives alone in the wild.\c\nEven though they are incredibly on-edge and\nit’s quite dangerous to approach them.
If I hadn’t adopted my Meowth, d’you think that\nthe people here at Aether would’ve taken it in?

The current president’s father was a very, very\nwealthy man and a great lover of Pokémon.\r\nHe built the Aether Foundation to protect them.
I’d like to see our research into finding ideal\nenvironments for Pokémon to live in be turned\r\ninto something tangible, you know?
Team Skull tries to capture Pokémon and then\nsell them off. That’s what I heard anyway.\c\nBut if a species of Pokémon goes extinct, you’ll\nnever ever be able to meet one again.\r\nDoesn’t it just seem unimaginable?
Just reducing the amount of unnecessary\ngarbage that you produce will help protect\r\nthe environments of many Pokémon!\c\nThat’s all you have to do and you’ll be able to\nhelp conserve wild Pokémon, too!

Welcome to Aether Paradise.\nThe Pokémon sanctuary is on the upper floor.

The president is such a nice lady.\c\nShe invites trial-goers like us here to tour the\nAether Foundation.
Is the president all right, do you think?\nI’m worried after seeing that news broadcast...
They say we’re to ship these greens that\nFarfetch’d like to eat to other lands.\c\nHere, why don’t you take one, too?
Apparently the Farfetch’d populations have\nbeen dropping in other regions because they\r\ncan no longer find as many of these greens that\r\nhave traditionally been their food source.
We’re here to study how things are done\nhere at the foundation.\c\nThe goals of this place are pretty much in\ndirect opposition to Fuchsia City’s Safari Zone.

When Pokémon evolve, their appearance can\nchange quite a lot.\c\nSome Pokémon can also change forms, which\ncan change how they look and their stats.\c\nAnd then there are the regional variants, which\nare quite another thing altogether.\c\nPokémon don’t just change into regional variants\nlike they might change forms.

Regional variants...\c\nIt can all seem a bit complicated, but think\nabout it like this...\c\nIf you visit a tropical region, you get a tan, right?\nIsn’t it something like that?
It’s like it tore a hole in space...\nDoes this world connect to...somewhere else?
Starmie is known as the Mysterious Pokémon.\c\nIf it’s really a star from the night sky appearing\nto us in a different form...\c\nThen it’s like a Pokémon is just using us humans\nand making us take care of it.\r\nDo you ever imagine things like that? I do.
Wh-what is that hole?!\nWhat is going on?!
Sudowoodo is a Pokémon that pretends to be a\ntree in order to protect itself.\c\nBut...wouldn’t it be better to disguise itself as\nthe kind of tree you actually see here in Alola?\r\nOr would that make it seem like an Exeggutor?
Wood?
The PC Boxes were first developed by a guy\nin the Kanto region called Bill.\r\nApparently he’s a real Pokémon maniac!
Imagine using the same Pokémon in your Boxes\nin battle again after hundreds of years...\r\nIt’s like a kind of time machine, isn’t it?
We are also protecting so-called\nregional variants.\c\nWhat is it in the climate and features that is\naffecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters, such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.
I’m in no position to face my children now...\c\nI’ve lost any right to claim that I am protecting\nPokémon as well...\c\nIf I can’t be a mother to them, and I’m no longer\nworthy to be the president of this foundation...\r\nthen what am I to be?[VAR 0114(0014)]

We use the motion of the waves to generate\nelectricity to power the whole building.
We get more than just ferry boats in here.\nWe also have things brought in by cargo boat.
There are some things in life you just can’t do\nanything about.\r\nYou’ll be happier if you don’t think about them.
Whenever we try to help some Pokémon or\nanother, that Team Skull gets in our way!\r\nI’ve got a real bone to pick with them!
I was working in Driftveil for a while, helping\nPokémon that got separated from their Trainers.\r\nBut I left once things settled down there.
Can’t you see I’m in the middle of work here!\nGet outta here! It’s not safe for kids!
We’re checking to make sure that no Pokémon\nhave slipped in and come along for the ride.\c\nCan’t be too sure, when we’ve got non-native\nPokémon like Grimer taking over here in Alola!\r\nInvasive species are not to be taken lightly.

This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Introduction\c\nAre you interested in success, dear readers?\nThen allow me to introduce myself.\c\nMy name is F, and I am an elite, self-made man.\c\nHere on my blog, I will show you the way\nto succeed.
This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Multitasking\c\nCurrently I am working on the development of a\nspecial sort of ball, which I took over from my\r\npredecessor, in parallel with another project.\c\nSeeing how well I multitask impresses my\nsubordinates and increases their motivation.\c\nShowing how skillful you are is a kind of \non-the-job training for your underlings.
This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Hedging risks\c\nI once ventured to undertake a project without\nnotifying my superior.\c\nI developed a device to restrain a dangerous life\nform, in case it became necessary to do so.\c\nI had it made for hedging risks to protect\nmyself, but for better or worse, it was\r\nmade public.\c\nIt is always essential to consider the risks\nbefore one takes action.
This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Massaging the truth\c\nMy superior’s family stole the results of our\nresearch and ran off.\c\nHowever, I have chosen to never blow this issue\nout of proportion.\c\nI will only be reprimanded for my own mistakes,\nand surely my superior is also displeased with\r\nthe actions of her family as well.\c\nWhen necessary, one must always be prepared\nto massage the truth to protect one’s own\r\nposition. It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\nthis skill is vital for success.

BKP Development Record #44\c\nModels have been fitted with control masks to\nmitigate the effects of their rejection of the\r\nRKS System.\c\nDue to the implementation of these control\nmasks, our RKS System initialization tests\r\nhave failed.\c\nAll three models of Type: Full are to be\ncryogenically frozen for the rest of eternity.\c\nThe name of these models has been changed\nfrom Type: Full to Type: Null.

Hey! You came back to this planet?!
Huh? But you’re not wearing any protective\ngear... Could it be you’re from a different world?
...Huh? You don’t know what I mean?\nOh, are you from a different world?
Well, I guess it doesn’t really matter. Please,\nmake yourself at home! I know it’s a bit of a\r\nmess here, but...
If you want to head out, just follow the pipe.
Everyone else ran off to some distant planet.\nBut since Mr. Glutton is still here and all, I felt\r\nlike, y’know, maybe I should stick around, too.
Hey, wow, you actually were able to keep up\nwith Mr. Glutton! It’ll be back once it gets\r\nhungry. I bet it would love to play again, too!
Mr. Glutton really seems to like you! You’re an\ninteresting person, that’s for sure.\c\nMr. Glutton will eat just about anything, but\nplease, take good care of it!
Hey there! Come for a bit of chitchat?
Tell me about Guzzlord
What’s that leaking machine?
So, that damaged screen...
What’s up with that suit?
No, I’m good
Guzzlord...? Oh, you mean Mr. Glutton? His kind\nhave lived on this planet since long before I was\r\neven born.\c\nThey eat anything, and I mean literally anything.\nTrash, toxic waste, you name it. But their\r\nnumbers seem to be decreasing these days.
Oh, that’s a filtering machine to make the dirty\nwater here clean. But one of the pipes broke,\r\nso there’s a bit of a leak. The water-purity level\r\nis still pretty high, so it should be safe to drink\r\nfor now.
It starts playing videos and music and such if\nyou put it in a bright spot.\c\nI’ve never seen it aside from on the monitor, but\nI guess that’s the color folks used to call “blue.”
I heard that back in the day, people would\nspend a lot of time every day worrying about\r\nwhat to wear. Things are much less complicated\r\nnow, since the only choice is this suit.\c\nBreathe too much of the air around here without\nthe suit, and it can be very dangerous.\c\nUh, actually, you may want to keep breathing to\na minimum if you’re going outside.
Oh, come again anytime!
What are all those cards?
That power plant poster...
I found a faded sign...
Oh, those? Each little card is a storage device—\nthey can hold a huge amount of information.\c\nAll the data in the world could fit on one\nbookshelf! But the machine used to read them\r\nis broken, so they’re not much use now...
You noticed that poster, did you? I found it\nburied in the rubble and decided to put it up.\c\nThe people from my grandparents’ generation\nburned most of them, so they’re hard to find!\c\nWhenever I brought up the power plant, it\nseemed like the adults didn’t want to hear\r\nabout it, but I like that poster. It’s cheerful.
Apparently, that sign is from an older era than\nthe rest of the rubble around here. It’s a bit sad\r\nI can’t read all of it, but it’s just so rusted...\c\nIt must have been placed in an area that was\nrough on metal or something.
What do Guzzlord eat?
They’ll eat anything they find, like rubble, waste,\nwhatever. They have a huge appetite, so we\r\ncouldn’t take them to the other planets...\c\nOh! Please, don’t mess too much with\nMr. Glutton’s food out back.

A pipe on the big machine has burst, and clean\nwater is pouring out.
Zzzzzt! Thizzz place is completely wrecked!\nWhat in the world happened here?
There’s too much rubble in the way.\nYou won’t be able to pass through here.
Cards labeled “Relocation Notice” are scattered\nall over the place.
A poster for an apparel shop is stuck sideways.\n“Every day is a summer sale! Amazing fashion\r\nhas never been more affordable!”
A poster for the power plant is stuck sideways.\n“Safe and secure! Let our power light up\r\nyour lives!”
...oli... ...ity Ha...\n“Servi... ... ...ity’s... ...need...”
The letters were too faded to read clearly.
Blue sea and blue sky!\nAhead is the beachfront area!
The screen is playing static-filled messages\nover and over.

I hope President Lusamine is not in any danger...
It feels so dark and twisted here... I can’t\nimagine this is a good place for the Pokémon!
That “R” symbol... It makes me very uneasy...
Hyyyyyp...
I saw it— Saw it with my own eyes! The mansion\ntransformed into that evil castle in an instant!\c\nWhat technology could cause such a thing?!\nI want to research it! I MUST research it!
Team Rocket came in and took over everything\nso quickly. They were like...well, like a rocket.
I need to be the first to get an interview with\nthe leader of Team Rocket! Better start training\r\nmy Pokémon!
My camcorder got busted in all the excitement!\nIt’s all Team Rocket’s fault! I’m gonna report on\r\nevery dirty little secret they have!
At least it seems Team Rocket aren’t in the\nunderground lab or the conservation area...
Prrf...
I thought a Janitor might be let into the mansion,\nbut they chased me away—just like that!
Ms. Wicke has been requesting aid from all the\nislands. Is that how you found out, Champion?
Some more Ultra Wormholes opened up after the\npress conference... Some new evil presence has\r\ncome to Alola! I can feel it!

The strange creature was sucked into\nthe Zygarde Cube!
Sina wants to talk to you! Zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
I just received a signal from your Zygarde Cube!\c\nThe creature that just got sucked into the cube\nis what we call a “[VAR COLOR(0001)]Zygarde Cell[VAR COLOR(0000)]”!\c\nThe Zygarde Cube I gave you is like a nest for\nCells and Cores.\c\nYour mission is to collect all the Cells\nand Cores!\c\nWe’ll get in touch.\nBonne chance![VAR 0114(0026)]
You’ve collected 10% so far.\c\nIf you’d like to know what this number means,\nplease come to the Aether Base on Route 16 on\r\nUla’ula Island!\c\nYou are getting warmer!\nBonne chance![VAR 0114(0026)]
You’ve collected no less than 50% of all the\nCells and Cores!\c\nI wonder how your painstaking efforts will pay\noff. Why don’t you visit the Aether Base on\r\nRoute 16 on Ula’ula Island?\c\nYou are getting even warmer!\nBonne chance![VAR 0114(0026)]

I just received a signal from your Zygarde Cube!\c\nThe creature that just got sucked into the cube\nis what we call a “[VAR COLOR(0001)]Zygarde Core[VAR COLOR(0000)]”!\c\nCores are mysterious creatures that form\nZygarde together with Cells!\c\nAlso, Cores retain Zygarde’s moves!\c\nYou can use the Zygarde Cube to teach\nyour Zygarde a move!\c\nWhy don’t you try it sometime?\nBonne chance![VAR 0114(0026)]
I see that you’ve just collected another\nZygarde Core!\c\nEach of these Core moves are memorized by\nthe Zygarde Cube, so you can use it to teach\r\nZygarde moves as many times as you’d like!\c\nEverything is up to you!\nBonne chance![VAR 0114(0026)]
