Where has our WALLY gone?\cWe have to leave for VERDANTURF TOWN\nvery soon...
Hiya! Are you maybe...\nA rookie TRAINER?\cDo you know what POKéMON TRAINERS\ndo when they reach a new town?\cThey first check what kind of GYM\nis in the town.
See? This is PETALBURG CITY's GYM.
This is the GYM's sign. Look for it\nwhenever you're looking for a GYM.
My face is reflected in the water.\cIt's a shining grin full of hope...\cOr it could be a look of somber silence\nstruggling with fear...\cWhat do you see reflected in your face?
Let's say you have six POKéMON.\nIf you catch another one...\cIt is automatically sent to a STORAGE\nBOX over a PC connection.

WALLY'S HOUSE
I'm the ENERGY GURU!\nI'll go for it and sell you what you need!
Oh?\nYour [STR_VAR_1]...
Went for it stupendously!\cAs its reward, please give it this\nEFFORT RIBBON.
[PLAYER] received the EFFORT RIBBON.
[PLAYER] put the EFFORT RIBBON\non [STR_VAR_1].
You have to go for it a little harder.\cIf you do, I'll give your POKéMON\nsomething nice.
Oh! Your [STR_VAR_1], that EFFORT\nRIBBON looks good on it!
The light of the lighthouse reaches\ndozens of miles away.\cI wonder if it doesn't startle POKéMON\nin the sea.
Ooh, look at this!\cThe seaweed you can get around these\nparts is fresh and full of life.\cWhy, it looks like it can even rear up\nand attack!
Where the water is clean, the fruits\nof bountiful harvest gather.\cAnd where people gather, a market\nsoon starts.\cThat is how a town is born and grows.
Shopping where you can breathe the\nscent of the ocean...\cSLATEPORT is such a wonderful place!
If you put DOLLS or CUSHIONS on the\nfloor, they'll get dirty.\cI'm going to buy some BRICKS so my\nDOLLS and CUSHIONS won't get dirty\rwhen I leave them out.
Yeah! I've waited so long for this!\nPOKéMON CONTESTS!\rI'm going to enter!\cBut before I do, I have to catch some\nPOKéMON!
Whew... I'm just bushed...\cI hiked over from MAUVILLE CITY.\nBut, boy, this city's huge.\cIf I'd known this, I would've ridden\nmy BIKE here.
STERN, the fellow who built the\nMUSEUM, also happens to be the leader\rof an undersea exploration team.\cSo, everyone calls him CAPT. STERN.
What is that over there?\nThat long line...
When I was a child, I visited the\nMUSEUM often.\cI used to dream about the mysteries of\nthe sea after seeing the exhibits.
Hey, there! Quit pushing!\nThis is the line, can't you see?
TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] has a policy of\nassembling and dispersing at the\roperation site.
Our BOSS is brilliant.\cWhat would he want to do with a\nMUSEUM now?
What's the new scheme, I wonder?\cOur BOSS is scary when he's mad, so\nI'd better not screw things up...
If there's something we need in the\nMUSEUM, we should take it all!
Hey, you there!\nDon't butt in!
A long line, huh?\cIt reminds me of the times I lined up to\nbuy smash-hit games...
Why are we even lining up and paying?\nWe should just march in!
The sea is just so vast...\cCould the sea have been made by the\ntears shed by POKéMON?
Do you know what they do with old\nships that become too creaky to sail?\cThey sink them in the sea so they\nbecome habitats for POKéMON.
Whenever I visit here, I get carried\naway and buy too much.
If you want to change your POKéMON's\nnickname, you'll have to get the NAME\rRATER to help you.
Any POKéMON you get in a trade, you\ncan't change its nickname.\cThe original TRAINER's love for that\nPOKéMON is in the nickname.
A POKéMON CONTEST HALL opened in\nSLATEPORT recently.\cI plan on entering after I improve the\ncondition of my POKéMON.
Do you know about the machine\nBERRY BLENDER?
People have to work together to get it\nto spin faster.\cThe faster you can make it spin, the\nbetter [POKEBLOCK]S you can get, I've heard.
It's used for making a kind of candy\ncalled a [POKEBLOCK].\cIf you give a good [POKEBLOCK] to a POKéMON,\nits condition will improve by a lot.
I was hoping that it was a famous star\nso I could get an autograph.\cBut who's that being interviewed?\nIsn't that CAPT. STERN?
That lady interviewer is so cool and\npretty.\cWhen I grow up, I'm going to be an\ninternational journalist!
CAPT. STERN says they discovered\nsomething at the bottom of the sea.\cI wonder what it is?\nWhat could it be?
What's going on here?\cDid the good CAPTAIN come back with\na big fish from the ocean floor?
Hey! Are you watching?\nAm I on TV?
A TV interview! Here!\nThe CAPTAIN's a celebrity!
TY: Okay, CAPT. STERN, a big smile\nfor the camera!
GABBY: I see, I see. You've had a most\ninvaluable experience...
CAPT. STERN: Yes, indeed. We intend to\nmove ahead with our exploration.
GABBY: That's wonderful, CAPT. STERN!\nThank you for taking the time from\ryour busy schedule to talk to us.\cWe hope we can interview you again\nwith news of more discoveries!
CAPT. STERN: Whew...\cThat was my first time to be filmed for\nTV. That was nerve wracking.
Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou're looking great!\cWe made a huge discovery on our last\nseafloor exploration.\cWe found an underwater cavern on\nROUTE 128.\cWe think it's the habitat of a POKéMON\nthat's said to have been long extinct.
Fufufu...\nCAPT. STERN, I presume.\cWe of TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] will assume\ncontrol of your submarine!\cYour objections are meaningless!\nWe expect your total cooperation!\cFufufu...\nJust watch and learn what TEAM\r[EVIL_TEAM] has planned!
CAPT. STERN: What was that all about?\cIt sounded like someone using a\nmegaphone...\cWhere did it come from?
It's from the HARBOR!\cThe submarine!\nThey're trying to take it!
[PLAYER][KUN]!\nPlease, come with me!

UNCLE: It's because of POKéMON that\nthis boy's got more pep, I suppose...\rBut he's become a bit too peppy...
WALLY: Aww, UNCLE, please?\cI want to challenge this GYM and see\nhow much better I've become.\cPlease? May I, please?
UNCLE: Now hold on, WALLY.\cSince you started living with POKéMON,\nyou have grown quite a lot stronger.\cBut don't you think you're pushing it\nto suddenly challenge a GYM?
WALLY: I'm not pushing it.\cIf I combine forces with RALTS,\nwe can beat anyone!
WALLY: Oh! Hi, [PLAYER]!\cI've gotten a lot stronger since we\nmet.\c[PLAYER], I want you and my UNCLE to\nunderstand that.\c[PLAYER], please, will you have a\nbattle with me?
WALLY: Oh... If you won't battle me,\n[PLAYER], my UNCLE won't know that I've\rbecome really strong.
UNCLE: [PLAYER][KUN], was it?\nOn WALLY's behalf, can I ask you to\rbattle with him just this once?\cI don't think he's going to listen to\nany reason the way he is now.
WALLY: [PLAYER], please!\nBattle with me, please.
WALLY: [PLAYER], thank you.\cOkay... Here I come!
WALLY: ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cI lost...
WALLY: UNCLE...\nI'll go back to VERDANTURF...
[PLAYER], thank you.\nBeing a TRAINER is tough, isn't it?\cIt's not enough just to have POKéMON\nand make them battle. That isn't what\rbeing a real TRAINER is about.
UNCLE: WALLY, there's no need to be so\ndown on yourself.\cWhy, what's keeping you from becoming\nstronger and stronger?\cCome on, let's go home.\nEveryone's waiting for you.
UNCLE: [PLAYER][KUN], it just dawned on me\nthat you must be the TRAINER who kept\ran eye out for WALLY when he caught\rhis POKéMON.\cWhy don't you visit us in VERDANTURF\nsometime?\rI'm sure WALLY would enjoy it.
WATTSON: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou look like you have a lot of zip!\rThat's a good thing, wahahahaha!\cFine! I've decided!\nI need a favor, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cMAUVILLE CITY has an underground\nsector called NEW MAUVILLE.\c[PLAYER][KUN], I'd like you to go there and\nswitch off the GENERATOR.\cThe GENERATOR has been running a bit\nhaywire. It's getting unsafe.\cHere, this is the KEY to get into NEW\nMAUVILLE.
WATTSON: Don't you worry about it.\nIt won't be a challenge to you.\cThe entrance to NEW MAUVILLE is just\na short SURF away from ROUTE 110.\cThat's it, then, you have my trust!\nWahahahaha!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\cI knew it, [PLAYER][KUN]! I knew I'd made\nthe right choice asking you!\cThis is my thanks - a TM containing\nTHUNDERBOLT!\cGo on, you've earned it!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\cIt pleases me to no end to see the\nyoung step up and take charge!
You know, it's cool to have POKéMON\nbattles and stuff...\cBut if your POKéMON gets hurt, you\nhave to nurse it back to health.
The roads of this town stretch north\nand south, and east and west.\cBecause of that, we get all sorts of\npeople coming through.
Have you been to RYDEL'S CYCLES yet?\cRYDEL, the owner, is a very generous\nman.

Hi, do you check out TV at all?\cThey've added a bunch of cool new\nshows recently.\cTV is so cool. I've seen my friends on\nTV just out of the blue.\cAnd, sometimes, they even put you on TV\nwithout telling you.\cI wish I would be on TV sometime.\cThat's why I think you should check\nout TVs whenever you can.
Hi, have you been checking out TVs?
The DEVON CORPORATION...\nWe all just shorten it to DEVON.\cThat company makes all sorts of\nconvenient products.
Hm? A sneaky-looking man?\cCome to think of it, yes, a shady-\nlooking guy went around the corner.
Have you taken the POKéMON GYM\nchallenge?\cWhen you get that shiny GYM BADGE\nin hand, I guess TRAINERS begin to\rrealize what is required of them.
Hey, that's RUSTBORO's GYM BADGE!\cOut of all the POKéMON GYM BADGES,\nRUSTBORO's is the coolest, I'd say.
Oh? Who might you be?\nYou're a new face around these parts.\cHave you just transferred into the\nPOKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL?
I challenged the GYM LEADER, but...\cIt's not going to be easy winning with\nmy FIRE-type POKéMON...\cFIRE-type POKéMON don't match up\nwell against ROCK-type POKéMON...

The old sailor MR. BRINEY lives in a\ncottage by the sea.\cHe said he was going shopping in\nSLATEPORT for his pet, PEEKO.\cThat old seadog, he must really love\nthat PEEKO.
Wow, you have POKéMON with you, too.\cWhen I get bigger, I'm going to go\nplaces with POKéMON, too.
POKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL!\cIf I go to this school, will I be able\nto catch rare POKéMON easily?
If a POKéMON gains experience in\nbattles, it can sometimes change in\rthe way it looks.
A POKéMON changes shape?\nIf one did that, I would be shocked!
A POKéMON you get in a trade from\nsomeone grows fast.\cBut if you don't have certain GYM\nBADGES, it may not obey you...
Get out! Out of the way!
Wait! Pleeeaaase!\cDon't take my GOODS!
Oh, it's you!\cYou're that fantastic TRAINER who\nhelped me in PETALBURG WOODS!\cHelp me! I was robbed by TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]!\nI have to get the DEVON GOODS back!\cIf I don't...\nI'm going to be in serious trouble.
That shady character, I think he took\noff towards the tunnel over there.
Oh! How did it go?\nThe DEVON GOODS?\cYou did!\nYou got them back!\cYou really are a great TRAINER!\cI know! As my thanks, I'll give you\nanother GREAT BALL!
Your BAG's full.\nI can't give you this GREAT BALL.
Excuse me, please!\nPlease come with me!
MAY: Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nHow's your POKéDEX coming along?\cMine's looking pretty decent.\cI caught POKéMON in PETALBURG WOODS\nuntil I ran out of POKé BALLS.
MAY: Oh, by the way, I passed MR. BRINEY\nin PETALBURG WOODS.\cI guess he's on his way home to his\ncottage by the sea.\c[PLAYER][KUN], you just moved here so you\nmight not know this, but MR. BRINEY\rwas once a revered seafarer.
BRENDAN: [PLAYER], how's your POKéDEX?\nHave you filled in any pages yet?\cMine rules.\cI went on a POKéMON-catching frenzy\nin PETALBURG WOODS until I ran out\rof POKé BALLS.
BRENDAN: By the way, I walked by MR.\nBRINEY in PETALBURG WOODS.\cI bet he was on his way home to his\ncottage by the sea.\cI bet you didn't know this, but he's\nalways got a POKéMON with him.

I've got my pride-and-joy POKéMON\nwith me. This time, I'll beat WINONA.
The ground absorbs rainwater, and\ntrees grow by drinking that water...\cOur FORTREE CITY exists because\nthere's both water and soil.
The CITY consists of homes built on\ntrees.\cPerhaps because of that lifestyle,\neveryone is healthy and lively.\cWhy, even myself - I feel as if I've\ngrown thirty years younger.
Living on top of trees is okay.\cBut sometimes BUG POKéMON come in\nthrough windows.\rIt can be really startling.
Some POKéMON evolve when they go\nthrough a Game Link cable.
Something unseeable is in the way.

MAY: Oh, hey?\n[PLAYER][KUN], are you shopping, too?\cI bought a whole bunch of DOLLS and\nPOSTERS.\cOf course, I've also caught a lot of\nPOKéMON, and I'm raising them\rproperly, too.\cActually, I'm more worried if you're\nraising POKéMON properly, [PLAYER][KUN].\cI'll battle with you, so you can show\nme your POKéMON, [PLAYER][KUN].
MAY: Oh, why? [PLAYER][KUN], haven't you\nbeen raising your POKéMON?\cThat's not a very good showing as a\nTRAINER...
MAY: Come on, battle with me, so I can\ncheck out your POKéMON!
MAY: The POKéMON I raised won't be\nbeaten by your POKéMON, [PLAYER][KUN]!
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cI remember the battle I had with you,\n[PLAYER][KUN], on ROUTE 103.\cThat battle helped you become this\nstrong, [PLAYER][KUN], didn't it?
MAY: I'm thinking of going back to\nLITTLEROOT soon.\cI've caught a decent group of POKéMON,\nand my POKéDEX is coming along, so\rI'm going home to show my dad.
[PLAYER][KUN], what are you going to do?\cCollect all the GYM BADGES and take\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?\cWell, while you're collecting BADGES,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I'm going to work on my\rPOKéDEX. I'll complete it before you!\cSee you!
[PLAYER][KUN], what are you going to do?\cAre you taking the POKéMON LEAGUE\nchallenge?\cOr, are you going to complete your\nPOKéDEX?\cI might've lost to you in battling,\nbut I'll finish my POKéDEX before you!\cSee you!
[PLAYER][KUN], what are you going to do?\cAre you taking the BATTLE TOWER\nchallenge?\cOr, are you going to complete your\nPOKéDEX?\cI might've lost to you in battling,\nbut I'll finish my POKéDEX before you!\cSee you!
BRENDAN: Oh, hey, it's [PLAYER].\cI'm running an errand for my dad.\nNo, I'm not buying any DOLLS.\cAnyways, it's been a while.\cWant to have a battle to see who's been\nraising POKéMON better?
BRENDAN: Oh, what's the matter?\nDon't have the confidence?
BRENDAN: Want to battle to see who's\nbeen raising POKéMON better?
BRENDAN: Aww, but you know I'm not\ngoing to lose to no [PLAYER].
Humph...\nYou've done a lot of raising.\cThat stings a bit - I had a head start\non you as a TRAINER...
BRENDAN: I...\nI plan on going home to LITTLEROOT.\cYou know I'm helping out my dad on his\nPOKéDEX. It's coming together pretty\rdecently, so I should go show him.
[PLAYER], what are you going to do?\cCollect all the GYM BADGES and take\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?\cMaybe I'll do that, too...\cWell, anyway, hang in there!
[PLAYER], what are you going to do?\cSince you're that strong, are you\ntaking the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?\cHeh, even me - if I trained my POKéMON\na bit more, I should be stronger than\ryou, [PLAYER].\cWell, anyway, hang in there!
[PLAYER], what are you going to do?\cSince you're that strong, are you\ntaking the BATTLE TOWER challenge?\cHeh, even me - if I trained my POKéMON\na bit more, I should be stronger than\ryou, [PLAYER].\rMaybe I will go to the BATTLE TOWER.\cWell, anyway, hang in there!
Fufufu...\cWe moved more loot into our secret\nHIDEOUT today...\cWh-who are you?!\nI was just talking to myself!
I'm just a GRUNT, so I don't know what\nthe BOSS is thinking...\cBut being on TEAM [EVIL_TEAM], I know I'll get\nthe chance to do big things!\cWh-who are you?!\nI was just talking to myself!
Hey, you!\cDon't go near the cave in the cove!\cWhy? You don't need a reason why!\nI'm an adult, so you just listen to me!
If this whole wide world becomes ours,\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]'s, it will be a happier\rplace for POKéMON, too.
There! WAILMER!\nLeap out of the water now!
Hunh? What do you want?\cYou're messing up our training, so can\nyou, like, get lost?
The POKéMON that come to this CONTEST\nHALL are all prizewinners.\rThey come from all over the country.\cMy heart swells with excitement!
Have you seen that strange cave in\nthe cove at the edge of town?
I'm going to teach my POKéMON some new\nmoves for entering a CONTEST.\cSo, I'm going to see the MOVE DELETER\nand make it forget HM moves.
I came from KANTO.\cThe HOENN region is beautiful with\nall its water and verdant nature.\cHunh? Wait a second...\cCould there be rare POKéMON that live\nonly in this area?
TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]'s been training their\nWAILMER in the cove.\cWe SAILORS can't get our boats out\nto sea with them in the way!
Ahoy, did you know?\cSomeone punted TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] out of the\nway for us!\cThat got the WAILMER out of the cove,\nso we can get our boats out again.
I was taking a relaxing snooze at the\nseaside inn to the sound of waves...\cWhen someone stole my POKéMON!\cWho's the abductor?\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]? Is it TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]?
My missing POKéMON...\nIt came back without me noticing!
I'm an ART DEALER.\cI am a buyer and seller of fine art,\nespecially paintings.\cI've heard that the MUSEUM here has\nmagnificent works on exhibit...
Even as we grow old and wrinkled, the\nsea remains forever young with the\rvivid brilliance of life...\cFwohoho fwohohohoho...
It was sixty years ago that my husband\nproposed to me here.\rThe sea remains as beautiful as ever.\cMufufufu mufufufufufu...
Hm, you know of the peculiar cavern\nin this cove?\cThat had been a natural formation, but\nthen that TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] lot came along\rand made their renovations.\cThey call themselves the “nature-loving\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]”!\cBut what they do and what they say\ndon't match at all!
That cave in the cove...\nIt seems someone sealed the entrance,\rso no one can enter it anymore.\cThat TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] lot, they must\nhave gone away for good.

Is it really that fun collecting\nrocks? I don't get it.
Yeah, you think so, too! What are you\nsupposed to do with some weird rock?
Around MOSSDEEP, you can see wild\nWAILMER.\cIt's called, uh...\nWhat was it now...\cWAI, WAI, WAI...\cWAILMER watching!
The island's SPACE CENTER has been\nlaunching huge rockets.
I'd heard from my mates in LILYCOVE\nthat the herd of WAILMER has\rdisappeared.\cWhat went down over there, I wonder?
Wouldn't it be nice?\cIf the whole world was covered in\nplants and flowers like this island?
All life needs the sea to live, even\nthough it makes its home on the land.\cLife, having run its course, becomes\nsoil and returns to the land.\cAnd the sea is always connected to\nthe land.\cYes, like the very shoreline here.
A voyage on a ship is fine.\cBut crossing the sea with POKéMON\nusing SURF...\cNow that's an exhilarating trip!\nWouldn't you agree, youngster?
This rock has a special meaning to\nthe people at the SPACE CENTER.\cThey put it here as their wish for\ntheir rockets to fly safely.\cWhen you make a wish, what do you use?\nDo you wish upon a star?\cI use a wish tag to make it happen.\nThat's what I do.

STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN], I never expected you\nto be holding the RED ORB.\cYou'll be okay. With your POKéMON,\nyou'll get things done no matter what.\cI'm convinced of it!

All life starts at the CAVE OF ORIGIN,\nand it all ends on MT. PYRE...\cWhere do people and POKéMON come\nfrom? Where are we bound?
Let me guess, you're going to challenge\nWALLACE?\cOh, you are really?\nYou're awfully brave!
Let me guess, you've beaten WALLACE!\nOh, you did, really?\cMaybe I'll become your fan!

BRENDAN: [PLAYER], hey, it's been a while.\nHow's it going?\cHmm...\nThat's a decent collection of BADGES.\cAll right, then.\nYou may as well have this.
BRENDAN: Keep those with you if you're\nplanning on going into that desert near\rROUTE 111.\cThere should be some POKéMON that\nare exclusively desert-dwellers.\rYou might look around for those.\cAs for me...\nI'm considering challenging NORMAN,\rthe GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.\cUnlike you, [PLAYER], your dad looks like\nhe really is tough.\cSee you around!
I have here an EGG.\cI'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in\nhot sand by the hot springs.\rBut that doesn't seem to be enough...\cI've heard it would be best if it were\nkept together with POKéMON and\rcarried about.\cYou are a TRAINER, yes?\nAnd your POKéMON radiate vitality.\cSo, what say you?\nWill you take this EGG to hatch?
Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with\nthis here EGG!
[PLAYER] received the EGG.
Oh? You've too many POKéMON.\nThere's no room for this EGG...
As you wish, then...\cIf you have a change of heart about\nhatching this EGG, I will be here.

Oh, you like hot springs, do you?\cThat's surprising for one as young\nas you.
I bathe in the hot springs every day.\cI want to become a beautiful and strong\nGYM LEADER like FLANNERY.

If you're going to throw a POKé BALL,\nweaken the wild POKéMON first.\cIt will be easier to catch if it's been\npoisoned, burned, or lulled to sleep.
You're a thief if you try to steal\nsomeone else's POKéMON.\cYou should throw POKé BALLS only at\nwild POKéMON.
Oh, no, I'm not a TRAINER.\cBut that's right, if TRAINERS lock eyes,\nit's a challenge to battle.\cIf you don't want to battle, stay out\nof their sight.

MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], you've been busy\ntraining, too, haven't you?\cI think you deserve a reward!\nThis is from me!

BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER].\nSo this is where you were.\rHow's it going?\cHave you been raising your POKéMON?\nI'll check for you.
Hmm...\nYou're pretty good.

Wouldn't it be great to ride a BIKE\nat full speed on CYCLING ROAD?
How do you like the way my raven-\ncolored hair streams behind me?\cI grew my hair out just for that.
Oh, hey, you got that BIKE from RYDEL!\cOh, it's glaringly obvious.\nIt says right on your bike...\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL...\nThat name's everywhere.\cYou should ride it around all over\nthe place - it's good advertising!
The two roads, one above, one below...\cA road each for people and POKéMON.\nPerhaps that is right and fair.
I don't have a BIKE, so I'll take a\nleisurely walk on the low road.
Learning techniques will make BIKE\nriding even more fun.\cThere are some places that you can\nreach only by using a BIKE technique.
Which should I choose?\cMake a beeline for MAUVILLE on\nCYCLING ROAD, or take the low road\rand look for POKéMON?
Number of collisions:\n... ... [STR_VAR_1]!\cTotal time:\n... ... [STR_VAR_2]!
Bravo! Splendid showing!\cYour love of cycling comes from deep\nwithin your heart.\rYou've shaken me to my very soul!
Your technique is remarkable.\cI suggest you slow down just enough\nto avoid collisions.
I would consider you a work in\nprogress.\cStill, I hope you don't forget the\nsheer pleasure of cycling.
My word... Your cycling skills border\non terrifying.\cMost certainly, you need much more\npractice riding.
...I am aghast...\cYou're perhaps not cut out for this\nunfortunate cycling business.\cYou ought to give serious thought to\nreturning that BIKE to RYDEL.
This is CYCLING ROAD.\cIf you were to ride from MAUVILLE to\nSLATEPORT on a MACH BIKE, you would\rbe rated for the number of collisions\rand your total time.
Regardless of the results, I count on\nseeing more challenges from you.\rAlways aim higher!
On this CYCLING ROAD, those riding\nMACH BIKES are rated for their number\rof collisions and their total times.\cACRO BIKES do not qualify for rating.\nThey are easy to turn, so it's not fair.

You're stronger than Mommy? Wow!\cBut I'm strong, too!\nReally! Honestly!

That's excellent!\c[RIVAL]'s been helping with my research\nfor a long time.\c[RIVAL] has an extensive history as\na TRAINER already.\cHere, [PLAYER][KUN], I ordered this for my\nresearch, but I think you should have\rthis POKéDEX.
[PLAYER] received the POKéDEX!
PROF. BIRCH: The POKéDEX is a high-tech\ntool that automatically makes a record\rof any POKéMON you meet or catch.\cMy kid, [RIVAL], goes everywhere\nwith it.\cWhenever my kid catches a rare POKéMON\nand records its data in the POKéDEX,\rwhy, [RIVAL] looks for me while I'm out\rdoing fieldwork, and shows me.
PROF. BIRCH: Countless POKéMON await\nyou!\cArgh, I'm getting the itch to get out\nand do fieldwork again!
MAY: Oh, wow, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou got a POKéDEX, too!\cThat's great! Just like me!\nI've got something for you, too!

Oh? Your BAG's full.
MAY: I wonder where I should go look\nfor POKéMON next?
BRENDAN: Huh...\nSo you got a POKéDEX, too.\cWell then, here.\nI'll give you this.
BRENDAN: You know it's more fun to\nhave a whole bunch of POKéMON.\cI'm going to explore all over the place\nto find different POKéMON.\cIf I find any cool POKéMON, you bet\nI'll try to get them with POKé BALLS.
Hey, your BAG's full.
BRENDAN: Where should I look for\nPOKéMON next...
It's a serious-looking machine.\nThe PROF must use this for research.
It's a PC used for research.\nBetter not mess around with it.
It's crammed with books on POKéMON.
It's a book that's too hard to read.
When a POKéMON battle starts, the one\nat the left of the list goes out first.\cSo, when you get more POKéMON in your\nparty, try switching around the order\rof your POKéMON.\cIt could give you an advantage.
When POKéMON battle, they eventually\nlevel up and become stronger.
If the POKéMON with you become\nstronger, you'll be able to go farther\raway from here.
That PC in the corner there is\nfor any POKéMON TRAINER to use.\cNaturally, that means you're welcome\nto use it, too.
POKéMON CENTERS are great!\cYou can use their services as much\nas you like, and it's all for free.\rYou never have to worry!
The POKéMON CABLE CLUB on the second\nfloor was built recently.\cBut they say they're still making\nadjustments.
The POKéMON CABLE CLUB on the second\nfloor was built recently.\cI traded POKéMON right away.
The clerk says they're all sold out.\nI can't buy any POKé BALLS.
I'm going to buy a bunch of POKé BALLS\nand catch a bunch of POKéMON!
If a POKéMON gets hurt and loses its HP\nand faints, it won't be able to battle.\cTo prevent your POKéMON from fainting,\nrestore its HP with a POTION.
There's a lot to be said for living on\na small island like this in harmony with\rPOKéMON and the family.
I came from the large port of SLATEPORT\nCITY when I married my husband here.\cLife goes by slowly on this little\nisland. But being surrounded by the\rbeautiful sea - that's happiness, too.
ZIGZAGOON: Guguuh!
There's a stone cavern at the edge\nof town.\cI've heard you can find rare stones\nthere.
Even if a POKéMON faints and can't\nbattle, it can still use a move learned\rfrom a Hidden Machine, HM.
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cDEWFORD's GYM LEADER BRAWLY commands\nFIGHTING-type POKéMON.\cGoing against him with NORMAL-type\nPOKéMON is asking for trouble.\cFIGHTING POKéMON will lay a serious\nsmack down on NORMAL POKéMON,\rso be careful!\cWhat's worse, the GYM is as dark as\nthe ocean floor.\cBut it will get brighter after defeating\nthe TRAINERS in your way.\cHey, okay, go for it!
Whoah! It's turned too bright in here!\cYour future is bright, too!

There's no need for BRAWLY to be\ninvolved!\cI'll crush you!

I'm not going to waste this loss.\nI'll use it to motivate me to train!\cOne day I'll become a GYM LEADER...\cNo, I'll become the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION!
Don't you dare brush me off!\nIt's not my fault if you cry!
Waaaaaaah!\nI lost!
I battle in the dark to make my heart\nstronger.\cBut because it's so dark, I can never\nsee BRAWLY's face...
I'm BRAWLY!\nDEWFORD's GYM LEADER!\cI've been churned in the rough waves\nof these parts, and I've grown tough\rin the pitch-black cave!\cSo you wanted to challenge me?\nLet me see what you're made of!
Whoah, wow! You made a much bigger\nsplash than I expected!\cYou swamped me!\cOkay, you've got me.\nTake this GYM BADGE!
[PLAYER] received the KNUCKLE BADGE\nfrom BRAWLY.
The KNUCKLE BADGE makes all POKéMON\nup to Level 30, even those you get in\rtrades, obey without question.\cAnd, you'll be able to use the HM move\nFLASH outside of battle.\cIf you'd like, use this TECHNICAL\nMACHINE, too.
That TM08 contains BULK UP.\cIt's a move that raises both ATTACK\nand DEFENSE stats.
I can see your talent becoming a giant\nwave to cause a storm of astonishment\ramong TRAINERS one day!

What?!\nIs that so?!\cIt's not easy for an older fellow like\nme to keep up with trends!
This whole business about\n“[STR_VAR_1]”...\rIsn't there a TV show on it?
Across the sea...\cIs “[STR_VAR_1]”\neven more popular?
I collect official\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rlicensed merchandise.\cI have official\n“[STR_VAR_1]” dolls...\cOfficial “[STR_VAR_1]”\nbrand clothing...\cAnd officially licensed\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rpicture books.\cHeheh, I own!\nI'm not sharing anything with you!
IDENTIFYING GOOD\n“[STR_VAR_1]” &\rBAD “[STR_VAR_1]”...\cTHE LINK BETWEEN\n“[STR_VAR_1]” AND\rPOKéMON...\cUSEFUL\n“[STR_VAR_1]”...\cIt's neatly jammed with books about\n“[STR_VAR_1].”
“[STR_VAR_1]'S\nSCREAM” is the title.
“[STR_VAR_1]'S\nSMILE” is the title.
It's titled “THE LAST\n[STR_VAR_1]”.
It's titled “THE BIRTH OF\n[STR_VAR_1]”.
I saw “[STR_VAR_1]”!\nCool, huh?\cIt's, like, the coolest thing going!\cIt was awesome!\nIt was the real thing, oh yeah!
Oh, no, no, no.\cThat alleged\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\ryou claim to have seen - it's not.\cThe authentic article is much...\nHow should I say it?\rSharper, yet more mellifluous!\cAh, no matter. It's astonishing!
Hey, listen, I composed a theme song\nfor “[STR_VAR_1].”\c“[STR_VAR_1]”\nis really popular right now.\cOkay, listen!\n... ...\cOh!\n[STR_VAR_1]!\cWonderful\n[STR_VAR_1]!
... ...\cI dare say, chap, it would pay for you\nto work on your singing before you\rtrifle yourself with\r“[STR_VAR_1].”
Anyway, as I was saying earlier, we\nshould get together and organize a\r“[STR_VAR_1]” party\ron the island.
Oh, a smashing good idea!\cIt will settle once and for all\nwho is the best at\r“[STR_VAR_1].”\rBrilliant, indeed!\cStarting today, our lives will revolve\naround “[STR_VAR_1]”!
I was thinking, though...\cWouldn't you agree that\n“[STR_VAR_1]” has\rgrown from being something trendy to\rbeing a part of our daily lives?
Beg pardon?\nThat much, what?\cHowever, it's true that\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rweighs heavily on your mind, whether\ryou're awake or asleep.\cAbsolutely, you're the\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rPROFESSOR, old sport!
If you and me team up as a combo,\nwe'll be invincible when it comes to all\rthings “[STR_VAR_1]”!
Spot on, my friend!\cWe shall be the\n“[STR_VAR_1]” DUO!\cIsn't that a ripe image?\nHahahah!
For me, SLUDGE BOMB is at the peak\nof popularity. It's the one.\cHunh? You're telling me that you don't\nknow about SLUDGE BOMB?\cThat's outright pitiful.\nI'll give you one.
I love SLUDGE BOMB.\cBut POKéMON with the\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rmove are in, too.
Gorge your eyes on this!\cIt's a SILK SCARF. It's right at the\ncutting edge of fashion, yeah!\cOh, I can see your eyes twinkling!\nYou appreciate my dazzling style!\cOh, you're a delight!\nHere you go. I want you to have it!
Oh, you don't have room?\cNow, listen tight, this SCARF is a must-\nhave! Why, I would sell all my items\rin order to get it!
The SILK SCARF raises the power of\nNORMAL-type moves.\cIt's a marvelous SCARF that will go\nwith almost all POKéMON!
Wow, you bothered to cross the sea\nto visit DEWFORD?\cDid you maybe come here because you\nheard about BRAWLY?\cHe's so cool...\nEveryone idolizes him.
Welcome to the HERB SHOP, home of\neffective and inexpensive medicine!
You've come to look at herbal medicine\nin LAVARIDGE?\cThat's rather commendable.\cI like you! Take this!
That CHARCOAL I gave you, it's used\nfor making herbal medicine.\cIt also does wonders when held by\na POKéMON.\cIt intensifies the power of FIRE-type\nmoves.
Herbal medicine works impressively well.\nBut your POKéMON will dislike you for it.\rIt must be horribly bitter!
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cLAVARIDGE's GYM LEADER FLANNERY\nuses FIRE-type POKéMON.\cHer passion for POKéMON burns stronger\nand hotter than a volcano.\cDon't get too close to her - you'll burn!\nHose her down with water and then\rgo for it!
Yow! That was a scorching hot battle!
Owowowowow!\nYikes, it's hot!
I'm blinded by sweat in my eyes...
Being buried in hot sand promotes\ncirculation.\cIt's effective for healing pain in\nyour joints.
I'm trying to relieve my stress.\nDon't come along and stress me out!
I hope FLANNERY flames you good!
Haaah... Whew...\cIf you spend too much time buried in\nhot sand, it tuckers you out...
You must be getting tired by now.\nYou'd like to rest in the hot sand,\rwouldn't you?\cBut you should know that maintaining\nyour willpower is an important ability\rfor all TRAINERS.
Play with fire, and be burned...
Your skill is real...\nBut our LEADER FLANNERY is strong.\cIf you don't watch yourself, you'll be\nburned seriously.
Can your POKéMON withstand\n392-degree heat?
It didn't burn hotly enough...
The temperature of magma is\n392 degrees.\cYour POKéMON beat me, so they should\neasily survive in magma.
Um...\nOkay, I'll battle with you.
Oh, but you're too strong.
I'm going to be a pretty and strong\nTRAINER just like FLANNERY.
Welcome... No, wait.\cPuny TRAINER, how good to see you've\nmade it here!\cI have been entrusted with the...\nNo, wait.\cI am FLANNERY, and I'm the GYM\nLEADER here!\cUh...\nDare not underestimate me, though\rI have been LEADER only a short time!\cWith skills inherited from my grand-\nfather, I shall, uh...demonstrate the\rhot moves we have honed on this land!
Oh...\nI guess I was trying too hard...\cI... I've only recently become a GYM\nLEADER.\cI tried too hard to be someone I'm not.\cI have to do things my natural way.\nIf I don't, my POKéMON will be confused.\cThanks for teaching me that.\nFor that, you deserve this.
[PLAYER] received the HEAT BADGE\nfrom FLANNERY.
If you have a HEAT BADGE, all POKéMON\nup to Level 50, even those you get in\rtrades from other people, will obey\ryou completely.\cAnd, it lets POKéMON use the HM move\nSTRENGTH outside of battle.\cThis is a token of my appreciation.\nDon't be shy about taking it!
That TM50 contains OVERHEAT.\cThat move inflicts serious damage on\nthe opponent.\cBut it also sharply cuts the SP. ATK\nof the POKéMON using it. It might not\rbe suitable for longer battles.
Your power reminds me of someone...\cOh! I know! You battle like NORMAN,\nthe GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.
LAVARIDGE TOWN POKéMON GYM
LAVARIDGE TOWN POKéMON GYM\cFLANNERY'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
My wife's warming an EGG in the hot\nsprings. This is what she told me.\cShe left two POKéMON with the DAY CARE.\nAnd they discovered that EGG!
ZIGZAGOON: Pshoo!
Use X SPEED to add to a POKéMON's\nSPEED in battle.\cThat will help it get in the first\nstrike - a decided advantage!
On MT. CHIMNEY's peak, there's a local\nspecialty that you can buy only there.\cGive it to a POKéMON - it will be elated.
I think POKéMON get closer to their\nTRAINERS if they spend time together.\cThe longer the better.\nThat's what I think.
I gave a RED [POKEBLOCK] to my POKéMON.\nIt looks a lot cooler all of a sudden.\cHmm...\nMaybe I ought to eat a RED [POKEBLOCK].
Hohoho! Hey, kid, you can reach\nthe hot springs from here.\cIf POKéMON are getting rest, so too\nshould their TRAINERS.
I'm having a hard time deciding if I\nshould make my SKITTY evolve or not.\cI only have to use this MOON STONE,\nbut it's so hard to decide...\cIf I make it evolve, it will become\nmuch stronger.\cBut it will look so different, too.
SKITTY: Miyao?
This NUGGET I found here...\nI suppose I'll have to sell it, seeing\ras how it has no other use.
They had a sketch of my POKéMON up\non the wall over there, but they\rchanged it with a new one already.\cI'm going to enter my HANA in CONTESTS\nso we can get her sketch up again!
Hi, are you making any [POKEBLOCK]S?\cYou should come by with a bunch of\nBERRIES sometime.
You see how they display a sketch of\na CONTEST winner here?\cI sketch them!\cIf any of your POKéMON wins a CONTEST,\nI'd gladly make a sketch of it!
Hello! Congratulations!\cI've put up a sketch of your POKéMON\nright here for everyone to see!
We do all right in the preliminary round,\nbut we can never win the appeals...\cMaybe it means I have to watch what\nother contestants are doing...
See!\nMy POKéMON won all these RIBBONS!\cHave your POKéMON earned any RIBBONS?\nYou can check them on your POKéNAV.
I can't beat GYM LEADERS...\cI can't win any CONTESTS...\cI've been here, there, and everywhere,\nand it's all for naught...
POKéMON CONTESTS\nSUPER RANK STAGE!
Oh, hello.\nYou are?\cOkay, your name's [PLAYER][KUN].\nI can see that you're a TRAINER.\cSo that means you use the POKéMON\nStorage System I developed.\cHow I arrived at that conclusion is\na simple deductive process.\cYou spoke to me because you wanted\nto access something on this PC.\cOh, I'm sorry. I'm LANETTE.\cHonestly, I'm glad to meet you - it's\ngreat you're using the Storage System.\cIf you could, please visit me at home.\nMy house is on ROUTE 114.
I wonder what POKéMON looked like\nlong, long ago?\cMaybe the FOSSIL MANIAC at the edge\nof town will know.
In the fields of FALLARBOR, we plant\nseedlings of hardy trees that thrive\reven in volcanic ash.
PROF. COZMO: Oh...\nI never should have let myself be\rconned into telling TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] where\ryou can find METEORITES...\cThat METEORITE from METEOR FALLS...\nIt's never going to be mine now...
Oh!\nHah?\cThat item...\cCould it be?\cIs it the METEORITE that TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]\ntook from METEOR FALLS?\cPlease, may I have it?\cI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO: This TM, it represents\nmy feeling of gratitude.\rPlease use it!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, I can't believe it.\nThis is really, really great!\cThis is really going to help my research!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, but...\nI'm crushed with disappointment...
PROF. COZMO: Please, may I have that\nMETEORITE?\cI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO went off to METEOR FALLS\non ROUTE 114 with some people from\rTEAM [EVIL_TEAM].
Poor PROF. COZMO...\nHe's so depressed... I feel sorry for him.
Look at PROF. COZMO...\nHe's so happy! I think it's cute.
I'm the MOVE TUTOR.\cI know all the moves that POKéMON\nlearn - every one of them - and I can\rteach POKéMON those moves.\cI can teach a move to a POKéMON\nof yours if you'd like.\cI'll do it for a HEART SCALE.\nI'm collecting those now.
Oh! That's it! That's an honest to\ngoodness HEART SCALE!\cLet me guess, you want me to teach\na move?
Which POKéMON needs tutoring?
Which move should I teach?
Sorry...\cIt doesn't appear as if I have any move\nI can teach that POKéMON.
[PLAYER] handed over one HEART SCALE\nin exchange.
If your POKéMON need to learn a move,\ncome back with a HEART SCALE.
Hunh? There isn't a single move that\nI can teach an EGG.
I went in through the entrance and\ntook a look around the CONTEST hall.\cGetting up on that big stage...\nIt's going to be tense!
Oh, my love for POKéMON...\nThe attraction they evoke in me...\cWhoops!\nYou weren't meant to see that!\rWell, anyway.\cIf you're entering a CONTEST, try this\nmove on for size.
My feelings for POKéMON...\nOh, they attract me so...
Which CONTEST are you planning on\nentering?\cIf you're entering a COOL CONTEST,\na cool POKéMON has to be the one!\cPick a POKéMON worthy of the CONTEST\ntheme, and make sure it has the\rright set of moves to match.\cThat's fundamental!
Which CONTEST are you entering?\nWant a piece of advice?\cIn any CONTEST, for example, a CUTE\nCONTEST, I don't think they judge you\ronly on cuteness in the first round.\cYou need to work out ways for raising\nPOKéMON better.
I raised my POKéMON to be cute.\cI found out you can put POKéMON in\na CONTEST for cuteness!\cI'm so glad I raised my POKéMON with\nloving care...
My POKéMON rules!\cIt's cool, tough yet beautiful, cute,\nand smart. It's complete!\cI may as well go for wins in every\nsingle CONTEST.
POKéMON CONTESTS\nNORMAL RANK STAGE!
For any POKéMON match, X SPECIAL\nis crucial.\cIt jacks up the power of some moves\neven though it's only for one battle.
They don't sell any items that will let\nyou win CONTESTS...\cIt means you have to raise POKéMON\ndiligently on an everyday basis.
The NEST BALL works better on\nweakened POKéMON.\cVERDANTURF is the only place you can\nbuy it.
I daresay a TRAINER isn't qualified if\nPOKéMON aren't settled and friendly.\rHave you given them any [POKEBLOCK]S?
Let me hazard a guess why you're in\nVERDANTURF. The reason: CONTESTS.\cAll CONTEST challenges originate here.
WALLY: I lost to you, [PLAYER], but I'm\nnot feeling down anymore.\cBecause I have a new purpose in life.\nTogether with my RALTS, I'm going\rto challenge POKéMON GYMS and become\ra great TRAINER.\cPlease watch me, [PLAYER].\nI'm going to be stronger than you.\cWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.
WALLY: Please watch me, [PLAYER].\nI'm going to get stronger than you.\cWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.
UNCLE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\nWALLY's next door.\cBut, boy, there's something I have to\ntell you.\cThis natural environment is doing\nwonders for WALLY's health.\cMaybe it's not just the environment.\nIt could be POKéMON that are giving the\rboy hope.
WALLY's gone away...\nHe slipped off on his own...
UNCLE: Is that right?\nWALLY's gone away that far all by\rhimself...\cWell, I have to give him credit - he is\nmy little brother's son.
WANDA: You are?\nOh, right, I get it!\cYou're the [PLAYER] who WALLY was\ntelling me about.\cI'm WALLY's cousin.\nGlad to meet you!\cI think WALLY's become a lot more lively\nand healthy since he came here.
WANDA: Don't worry about WALLY.\nHe'll be just fine.\cI know my little cousin, and he has\nPOKéMON with him, too.
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend\nevery day.\rHappy? You bet I am!
My daughter's boyfriend is a very\ndriven and passionate sort of person.\cHe's been digging a tunnel nonstop\njust so he can see my daughter.\cMy daughter's a little concerned,\nso she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend\nwas digging the tunnel by hand!\cIt's so incredible!
If anything were to happen to WALLY,\nI would never be able to look his\rparents in PETALBURG in the eye...
WALLY was in EVER GRANDE?\cHis parents in PETALBURG would be\nastonished to hear that!
Let me see your POKéMON.\nI'll check to see how much it likes you.\cOh.\nYour POKéMON...
It adores you.\nIt can't possibly love you any more.\rI even feel happy seeing it.
It seems to be very happy.\nIt obviously likes you a whole lot.
It likes you quite a lot.\nIt seems to want to be babied a little.
It's getting used to you.\nIt seems to believe in you.
It's not very used to you yet.\nIt neither loves nor hates you.
It's very wary.\nIt has scary viciousness in its eyes.\rIt doesn't like you much at all.
This is a little hard for me to say...\cYour POKéMON simply detests you.\nDoesn't that make you uncomfortable?
PIKACHU: Pika pika!
Far away, deep in EVER GRANDE CITY,\nis the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cThe TRAINERS who gather there are\nall frighteningly well skilled.
In the POKéMON LEAGUE, I think the\nrules say that you have to battle the\rELITE FOUR all in a row.\cIf you lose to any of them, you have\nto begin your challenge again from the\rfirst one.
What color is your TRAINER'S CARD?\nMine's copper!
PACIFIDLOG TOWN floats on top of\na colony of CORSOLA.\cIf I told you that, would you believe me?
The ancestors of the people in\nPACIFIDLOG were said to have been\rborn on boats and then lived and died \raboard them.\cI understand that they lived that way\nbecause they were searching for\rsomething.
In the HOENN region, there are three\nPOKéMON that represent the power of\rrock, ice, and steel.\cEach of them is said to hide away deep\ninside caves.\cThat's the story I heard when I was\njust a little kid.
“Six dots open three doors.”\cGrandpa used to say that, but I don't\nknow what he meant.
Er-hem!\cI am the POKéMON FAN CLUB's most\nimportant person, the CHAIRMAN's\ryounger brother.\cI'm here enjoying my vacation with\nPOKéMON, yes, indeed.
Ah!\nYour POKéMON...
It clearly likes you very much.\cA POKéMON that adoring and adorable\ndeserves a TM like this, no?
Hmm...\nIt's not bad, but it's also not good.\cYou, as the TRAINER, need to put in\nsome more effort.
It has a vicious look to it.\cA frightening POKéMON like that\ndeserves a TM like this.
If a POKéMON likes you a lot, RETURN's\npower is enhanced.\cIf it doesn't like you, FRUSTRATION's\npower goes up.
Oh, yes. In about [STR_VAR_1] or so days,\nI should be getting a good TM or two.\cYou should come see me then.\nI'll give you a TM that's suitable for\ryour POKéMON.
AZURILL: Rurii.
It appears to be very friendly with the\nTRAINER.
AZURILL: Rururi!
It doesn't appear to like the TRAINER\nvery much.
Hello, TRAINER. Would you do me a favor\nand trade POKéMON with me?\cLiving in PACIFIDLOG, I can only catch\ncertain kinds of POKéMON.\c[STR_VAR_1]? Do you have one?\nI'll trade you my [STR_VAR_2] for it.
Wow!\nThis [STR_VAR_1] is so fluffy!
That's no [STR_VAR_1].
I'm a little disappointed...
Since we traded, you and me,\nwe're friends, aren't we?
Is that a POKéDEX?\cDid you get to meet a lot of different\nPOKéMON?\cI wish I was like you.
People were saying they saw a POKéMON\nFLYING high above HOENN.\cIs it FLYING around all the time?\nDoesn't it need to rest somewhere?
A sky POKéMON!\nA sky POKéMON!
Where did you come from?
Yes?\nYES TOWN?\cI've never heard of a place like that.
No? That doesn't make any sense.\nYou have to come from somewhere.\cOh! Wait! You're not going to say you\nwere born at the bottom of the sea?
I can't see MIRAGE ISLAND today...
Oh! Oh my!\nI can see MIRAGE ISLAND today!
MIRAGE ISLAND...\cIt must become visible and invisible\ndepending on the weather conditions\rthat make mirages appear.\cOr is it really appearing and\ndisappearing?
You're...\nAh, you must be [PLAYER][KUN], right?\cThank you for playing with WALLY a\nlittle while ago.\cHe's been frail and sickly ever\nsince he was a baby.\cWe've sent him to stay with my relatives\nin VERDANTURF TOWN for a while.\cThe air is a lot cleaner there\nthan it is here.\cWhat's that? Where's WALLY?\nHe's already left, our WALLY.\cI wonder where he could have\ngotten by now?
I wonder how our WALLY is doing?
Hi there, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cOur WALLY's become very healthy\nsince he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.\cWe owe it all to you!\cWhen WALLY left town, you helped\nhim catch a POKéMON, right?\cI think that made WALLY really\nhappy.\cActually, not just WALLY.\nIt made me, his father, happy too.\cHappy that he's got such a great\nfriend as you.\cThis isn't a bribe or anything, but\nI'd really like you to have this.
If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be\nable to go to all sorts of places.
WALLY's coming home soon.\nI'm looking forward to that.
Oh? You met WALLY in EVER GRANDE\nCITY?\cOh, [PLAYER][KUN], don't be silly.\cHe may have gotten healthy, but he\ncan't go somewhere far away like\rthat all by himself.
WALLY was really happy when he told\nus that he caught a POKéMON.\cIt's been ages since I've seen him\nsmile like that.
Oh, hello, [PLAYER]! We've got\nsomething we want you to have.\cMy husband has it, so please have a\nword with him, dear.
I want you to keep this a secret\nfrom my husband...\cBut our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN\nwithout telling anyone.\cYou know, WALLY is frail, but\nhe's surprisingly strong-willed.\cI'm sure that he'll come back safe\nand sound one day!
DAD: Hm?\cWell, if it isn't [PLAYER]!\nSo you're all finished moving in?\cI'm surprised that you managed to\nget here by yourself.\cOh, I see.\nYou're with your POKéMON.\cHm... Then I guess you're going to\nbecome a TRAINER like me, [PLAYER].\cThat's great news!\nI'll be looking forward to it!
Um... I... I'd like to get a\nPOKéMON, please...
DAD: Hm? You're... Uh... Oh, right.\nYou're WALLY, right?
WALLY: I'm going to go stay with my\nrelatives in VERDANTURF TOWN.\cI thought I would be lonely by myself,\nso I wanted to take a POKéMON along.\cBut I've never caught a POKéMON before.\nI don't know how...
DAD: Hm. I see.
DAD: [PLAYER], you heard that,\nright?\cGo with WALLY and make sure that he\nsafely catches a POKéMON.
WALLY, here, I'll loan you my POKéMON.\cWALLY received a ZIGZAGOON!
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nA POKéMON!\cDAD: Hm. I'll give you a POKé BALL, too.\nGo for it!\cWALLY received a POKé BALL!
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nThank you!
[PLAYER]... Would you really come\nwith me?
DAD: So, did it work out?
WALLY: Thank you, yes, it did.\nHere's your POKéMON back.\c[PLAYER], thank you for coming along\nwith me.\cYou two are why I was able to catch\nmy POKéMON.\cI promise I'll take really good\ncare of it.\cOh! My mom's waiting for me, so I\nhave to go!\cBye, [PLAYER]!
DAD: Now...\c[PLAYER], if you want to become a\nstrong TRAINER, here's my advice.\cHead for RUSTBORO CITY beyond this\ntown.\cThere, you should challenge the GYM\nLEADER, ROXANNE.\cAfter her, go on to other POKéMON\nGYMS and defeat their LEADERS.\cCollect BADGES from them,\nunderstood?\cOf course, I'm a GYM LEADER, too.\nWe'll battle one day, [PLAYER].\cBut that's only after you become\nstronger, [PLAYER].
DAD: Hm? Aren't you going to the\nPOKéMON GYM in RUSTBORO CITY?\cThere's no challenge for me to\nbattle a greenhorn TRAINER.\c[PLAYER], I want you to challenge me\nwhen you become a lot stronger.\cI'll battle you, [PLAYER], when you\ncan show me four GYM BADGES, okay?
DAD: I see... So, you've beaten the\nGYM LEADER in RUSTBORO CITY.\cBut there are many more TRAINERS\nwho are stronger than you, [PLAYER].\cAcross the sea in DEWFORD TOWN is a\nGYM LEADER named BRAWLY.\cYou should go challenge him.
DAD: Hm... [PLAYER], you have gotten\nstronger.\cI can tell by the number of BADGES\nthat you've earned.
DAD: Hm...\nSo, you did get four GYM BADGES.\cFine, as I promised, we will have a\nPOKéMON battle.\c[PLAYER]...\cI'm so happy that I can have a \nreal battle with my own child.\cBut, a battle is a battle!\cI will do everything in my power as\na GYM LEADER to win.\c[PLAYER], you'd better give it your\nbest shot, too!
...\cI... I can't...\cI can't believe it. [PLAYER]...\cI lost to [PLAYER]?\cBut, rules are rules!\nHere, take this.
[PLAYER] received the BALANCE BADGE\nfrom DAD!
DAD: With that BADGE, the DEFENSE\nof all your POKéMON will increase.\cPOKéMON that know the HM move SURF\nwill be able to travel over water.\cThis is my gift to you. [PLAYER], I'm\nsure you can use it correctly.
DAD: TM42 contains FACADE.\cIt doubles the power of moves if\nthe POKéMON is poisoned, paralyzed,\ror burned.\cIt might be able to turn a bad\nsituation into an advantage.
DAD: As the GYM LEADER, I can't\nexpress how upset I am...\cBut as a father, it makes me both\nhappy and a little sad. It's odd...
DAD: Oh, yes...\cWALLY's parents came calling\nearlier.\cThey said that they had something\nthey wanted to give you, [PLAYER].
DAD: [PLAYER], you should go visit\nyour mother every so often.\cI'm going to stay here and redouble\nmy training.\cIt would bother me as a TRAINER to\nnot avenge my loss to you, [PLAYER]!
DAD: [PLAYER], how are things going?\cThe world of POKéMON is deep.\cI honestly think that no amount of\ntraining would ever be enough.
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cThe doors in this GYM open when you\nbeat the awaiting TRAINERS.\cWhoops! The doors in this room are\nalready open, so don't attack me!\cThe TRAINERS of PETALBURG GYM use\nall kinds of items.\cThe door at the left leads to the\nSPEED ROOM.\cThe door at the right leads to the\nACCURACY ROOM.\cThe room's name will be on the\ndoor, so choose carefully.\cOnce you've chosen the door...\nWell, hey, go for it!
[PLAYER]! Whoa! You've overcome even\nyour own father!\cLike, whoa!\nWhat a stunning turn of events!
The ability to attack before the\nopponent...\cJust that alone puts me at a great\nadvantage, don't you agree?
That was a magnificent battle!
Go on to the next room where a new\nchallenge awaits you.\cAt the left is the ZERO REDUCTION\nROOM.\cThe right door leads to the DEFENSE\nROOM.
Whomever you beat, and whomever you\nmay lose to, you never shirk from\rtraining yourself and your POKéMON.\cThat's what I think being a\nGYM LEADER is all about.
Don't waste your time trying to\nlower my POKéMON's abilities!
My POKéMON's abilities weren't\nharmed, but I still lost...
The next room is the STRENGTH ROOM.\nCan you withstand brute force?
After you beat our LEADER, the\ntraining has become a lot tougher.
Just when you think you're going to\nwin, your opponent restores HP...\cCan you just imagine how awful that\nmust feel?\cI'll show you exactly how awful it\nfeels!
I couldn't restore HP enough...\nWhat ATTACK power...
I should have expected no less from\nour LEADER's kid.\cNo, wait! A TRAINER's abilities are\nearned only through effort.\cI lost because my own efforts\nweren't enough.\cGo on! The ONE-HIT KO ROOM is next.
I'm going to keep training at GYMS.\nOne day, I'll become a LEADER.
I'm not going to take it easy just\nbecause you're our LEADER's kid.\cI'll show you how horrid it is for\na POKéMON to take a critical hit!
Your power...\nYou're the real deal.
Your father really is strong. He's\na TRAINER worth my respect.\cAnd, I sense the same glow coming\nfrom you as your father.\cI hope that you'll stage a terrific\nbattle with your father!
Since your dad became the LEADER,\nthe TRAINERS of PETALBURG CITY have\rbecome a lot tougher.
Giggle...\nThis is the ACCURACY ROOM.\cIt's pretty nasty when every attack\nlands without fail.
You were a cut above me...
There are some even stronger\nTRAINERS waiting for you.\cThe left is the DEFENSE ROOM, and\nthe right is the RECOVERY ROOM.\cYour POKéMON's ATTACK power will be\non trial either way.
Do you know what we're trying to\nachieve as TRAINERS?\cWe're striving to become soul mates\nwith our POKéMON.
The higher the DEFENSE, the more\nreckless I can be in attack.
Our defenses weren't enough...
I think you've taught me a valuable\nlesson here.\cNow, go on! The left door goes to\nthe STRENGTH ROOM.\cThe right door opens to the\nONE-HIT KO ROOM.\cBoth of them have TRAINERS who are\noffensively skilled.
Hi! Have you tried using SURF?
Our GYM LEADER told us to go all out\nand beat you.\cEven if you happen to be the\nLEADER's kid!
But... I went all out!
The way you use your POKéMON...\nIt's like your father's style.\cGo on through! The GYM LEADER, your\nfather, is waiting!
Sure, it's fine to make your POKéMON\nstronger.\cBut what decides the winner?\cWhy, it's the feelings TRAINERS have for\ntheir POKéMON.
This door appears to be locked\nright now...
“SPEED ROOM,” the sign says.\cDo you want to go through?

PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM
PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM\cNORMAN'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
Traveling is wonderful!\cWhen I was young, I roamed the seas\nand the mountains!
Sigh...\cI wish I could go on an adventure\nwith some POKéMON...\cCrawl through some damp grass...\nClimb rocky, rugged mountains...\cCross the raging seas...\nWander about in dark caves...\cAnd, sometimes, even get a little\nhomesick...\cIt must be fabulous to travel!
NORMAN became our town's new GYM\nLEADER.\cI think he called his family over from\nthe JOHTO region.
I battled NORMAN once, but, whew,\nhe was way too strong.\cHow would I put it?\cI just got the feeling that he\nlives for POKéMON.
That PC-based POKéMON storage\nsystem...\cWhoever made it must be some kind\nof a scientific wizard!
When my POKéMON ate an\nORAN BERRY, it regained HP!
There are many types of POKéMON.\cAll types have their strengths and\nweaknesses against other types.\cDepending on the types of POKéMON,\na battle could be easy or hard.
For example, your TREECKO is a\nGRASS type.\cIt's strong against the WATER and\nGROUND types.\cBut, it's weak against FIRE-type\nPOKéMON.
For example, your TORCHIC is a\nFIRE type.\cIt's strong against the GRASS and\nBUG types.\cBut, it's weak against WATER-type\nPOKéMON.
For example, your MUDKIP is a\nWATER type.\cIt's strong against the FIRE type.\cBut, it's weak against GRASS-type\nand ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.
Even if a POKéMON is weak now,\nit will grow stronger.\cThe most important thing is love!\nLove for your POKéMON!
Do you use REPEL?\nIt keeps POKéMON away, so it's\ruseful when you're in a hurry.
Do you have any ANTIDOTES with\nyou?\cIf you walk around with a poisoned\nPOKéMON, it will lose HP until it faints.\rTake some ANTIDOTES with you.
Umm... If this goes here, and that\ngoes over there...\cThen where does this thing go?\nAnd what about that doohickey?\cAaargh! I can't make heads or tails\nof this!
Hm?\nHi, I'm DOCK.\cCAPT. STERN commissioned me to\ndesign a ferry.\cOh! That there...\nAre they DEVON GOODS?\cBut, hmm...\nThis won't do...\cCAPT. STERN went off somewhere.\nHe said he had some work to do.\cCould I get you to go find CAPT.\nSTERN and deliver that to him?
DOCK: Where could CAPT. STERN have\ngone off to?\cCould you go find CAPT. STERN and\ndeliver that parcel to him?
DOCK: Shipbuilding is an art.\cA lot of things can't be figured out\njust by calculating.\cI really could use advice from a veteran\nwho knows the seas...
DOCK: Hi! MR. BRINEY's joined us to\nlend us his help.\cThanks to the veteran sailor, the\nferry is steadily coming together.
DOCK: The ferry is finally ready!\cThe new S.S. TIDAL is truly a marvel\nof technology!\cBut, I get the feeling that we can\nmake something even better.\cYou know, there's never an end to\ntechnology's march.
MR. BRINEY: Ah, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nIt's been too long!\cAye, since I met you, this old seadog's\nbeen feeling frisky!\cSo I've decided to help DOCK make a\nferry.\cAye, after all, a ferry would be able\nto carry a lot of people.\cBut, you know, that DOCK is really\nsomething special.\cWith his knack for technology and\nmy experience, I'm sure that we can\rbuild one great ship, aye!
PEEKO: Pii piihyoro!
The seasons, the weather, where the\nmoon sits in the sky...\cThese and other conditions make the\nsea change its expression.\cThat's right!\nThe sea is like a living thing!
I get seasick real easily.\nSo I get to help out here instead.
Designing a large ship is more like\nmaking a big building than putting\rtogether a transportation vehicle.
Don't you think it's strange that a\nship made of heavy iron floats?\cIt floats because of a principle\ncalled buoyancy.
The sea between SLATEPORT and\nPACIFIDLOG has a fast-running tide.\cOrdinary ships can't make headway\nthrough there.\cYou'd need substantial propulsion\nto plow through those waters...
I want to raise a POKéMON that's\nthe ultimate in “great” for both\rbattles and CONTESTS.\cIt's vexing, trying to figure out\nwhich moves I should make it learn.
Do any of your friends have any\nBERRIES?\cYou can use that BERRY BLENDER and\nmake [POKEBLOCK]S with your friends!\cYou should try it - it's a lot of fun!
I have two, so you can have one!
Make [POKEBLOCK]S and put them in there.\cWhen you make a [POKEBLOCK], everyone\nhas to put in a different BERRY.
If you win a CONTEST, they put up a\nposter of your POKéMON on the wall.\cIt will have a portrait of your\nPOKéMON and both your names.
Want a tasty little bit of advice\nfor CONTESTS?\cUsing a certain move after another\ncertain kind of move sometimes gets\ryou extra attention.\cIf you know what you're doing, you\ncan score big in appeal.\cOf course, your opponents might try\ndisrupting your POKéMON's showing.
My papa, he's a CONTEST JUDGE.\cI wonder what I should be when I\ngrow up, a JUDGE or a GYM LEADER?
Hey, man, I'm like majorly cheesed,\nyou know. Like, you know, I just\rwanted to know why my POKéMON\rnever won, you know, like, hey?\cSo, like, I gave the JUDGE my two\ncents, you know, they're free.\cAnd he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!\nSo, like, total bummer, man!\cHey, like, you! Zip it, you know?\nJust, you know, take this!
That's, like, TM41, you know?\nHey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?\cLike, it won't let the other guy\nuse the same move twice in a row, see?\cHey, now, you listen here, like,\nI'm not laying a torment on you!
MC: Oh, my, my!\nNow isn't that a dandy of a POKéMON?\cPlease! Do step right up and take\npart in our splendid CONTESTS!\cYou'll do well! I'm sure of it!\nMy eyes have never failed me!
JUDGE: Well, hello there!\nI see that you're a TRAINER!\cThen, it just wouldn't do for you\nto miss a POKéMON CONTEST!\cGet a CONTEST PASS in VERDANTURF\nCITY and enter anytime!
It's appeal time!\nWhat should I lead with?
They didn't pay much attention to\nmy POKéMON's appeal...\cHumph, that JUDGE, he doesn't know\na good thing when he sees it.
Oh, hi! You must be a serious fan to get\nthis close to the action.\cI'll reward your enthusiasm with this\nsage advice.\cIf a move goes over really well,\nthe audience will get excited.\cThe POKéMON that makes its appeal\nright when everyone's excited...\cWell, you'd think something good has\nto happen!
I can't do this! I'm more freaked out\nthan my POKéMON.\cI'm shivering and my heart is racing!
A battle and a CONTEST aren't the\nsame, but they are alike, too.\cYou need to work hard and believe\nin the POKéMON you've raised.
That POKéMON looks like it's on top\nof its game, huh?\cA POKéMON that does good in the\nsecondary judging seems to be more\rrelaxed when it's doing appeals.
Will you look at that sorry sight?\cHeh, my POKéMON's absolutely better\nthan that lot!
Don't you get the urge to move with\nPOKéMON if they're putting on an\renergetic appeal?
POKéMON CONTESTS\nHYPER RANK STAGE!
Hi, hi! I'm the NAME RATER!\nI'm the fortune-teller of names!\cI shall be pleased to rate your\nPOKéMON's nickname.
Which POKéMON's nickname should\nI divine?
Hmmm... [STR_VAR_1], is it? That is\nquite a fine name you bestowed.\cBut! What say you, if I were to\nsuggest a slightly better name?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!
I see.\nDo come visit again.
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\rHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm... [STR_VAR_1] it is!\cThis is a magnificent nickname!\nIt is impeccably beyond reproach!\cYou'll do well to cherish your\n[STR_VAR_1] now and beyond.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an EGG!
Er-hem! I am the CHAIRMAN of the\nPOKéMON FAN CLUB!\cBeing the CHAIRMAN, I am naturally\nthe most important!\cNo one could best me when it comes\nto raising POKéMON. No one!\cIn any CONTEST, my victory is a\nforegone conclusion!\cBut, that would deprive others of\ntheir enjoyment.\cSo, I now while away my time\nexamining the POKéMON of others.\cIt is marvelous to witness how\nothers have raised POKéMON.\cThe contented faces of properly\nraised POKéMON...\cThe kind and loving gazes of their\nTRAINERS...\cMy heart is overwhelmed - there is\nso much happiness.\cOh, my! Excuse me! I seem to have\nnattered on far too long!\cPlease, do allow me to examine your\nPOKéMON and see how it's grown.
How is your POKéMON growing?\nAllow me to examine it.
Hm, hm...\nI see...
Hmmm... It's not bad, but it's not\ngood, either...\cYou, the TRAINER, must put more\neffort into raising this POKéMON!\cFor instance, may I suggest that\nyou give it more [POKEBLOCK]S?
Oh, my...\cYour POKéMON is growing quite well,\nso you deserve a reward.\cUnfortunately, you have no space for\nthis in your BAG.
Your [STR_VAR_1], it is growing in\na most impressive manner!\rIt is one fine specimen!\cBut! If you were to give it this,\nit would grow even better! Indeed!
Let a POKéMON hold that RED SCARF.\cEveryone will recognize the coolness\nof that POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that BLUE SCARF.\cIts beauty will be accentuated much\nmore than now!
Let a POKéMON hold that PINK SCARF.\cIt will draw out the cuteness of\nthe POKéMON some more!
Let a POKéMON hold that GREEN SCARF.\cThat will enhance the\nsmartness of POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that YELLOW SCARF.\cIt will bolster your POKéMON's\ntoughness so much more!
I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to\ngive you! None at all!\cAfter all, you're blessed with the gift\nof raising POKéMON without resorting\rto any items!
I love seeing POKéMON that love\ntheir TRAINERS.\cPOKéMON are very sensitive to the\nfeelings of their TRAINERS.\cIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.\cWhen your POKéMON grow to love you,\nplease come show me.
Your POKéMON really adores you.\cFor you, a most compassionate\nTRAINER, a gift from the FAN CLUB!
POKéMON are very sensitive to the\nfeelings of their TRAINERS.\cIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.
If you keep letting a POKéMON faint\nin battle, it'll come to resent it.\cSoon, it will become less trusting\nof the TRAINER.\cIn other words, it certainly won't\nlike you very much.
Do POKéMON enjoy having items used\non them?\cMine acted really happy when I gave\nit some PROTEIN.
SKITTY: Fffnyaaaah...
ZIGZAGOON: Kyuuu...
AZUMARILL: Marimari?
Welcome to the OCEANIC MUSEUM.\cThe entrance fee is $50.\nWould you like to enter?
Please enjoy yourself.
Oh? I'm sorry, but you don't seem to\nhave enough money.
Oh? You're with that group that\nwent in earlier?\cYou're the only one who's late.\nYou'd better go catch up to them!
Please visit another time!
We, TEAM [EVIL_TEAM], exist for the good\nof all!
We were told to assemble here, so\nwe did, but...\cOur BOSS, the lynchpin, isn't here.
If I ripped off the stuff here,\nwould it make me rich?
What I learn here, I can put to use on\nnefarious deeds...
If our goons didn't bungle things\nin RUSTBORO, we wouldn't be here!
I didn't have $50, so it took a long\ntime getting by the receptionist.
I want to learn about the sea and\nuse that knowledge for battling.
I get all giddy and gooey when I\nsee the sea!\cFor me, CAPT. STERN is the number\none role model!
The sea is vast without end, and\ninfinitely deep...\cThere must be many POKéMON that we\ndon't know about.
I want a sea POKéMON.\cI think it would feel cool and nice\nto hug.
Aiyeeeh!\nWhat are you doing here?\cMe? I'm the TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] member you\nthumped before, remember?\cHere, take this!\nYou have to forgive me!
Aww, darn it!\nYou so screwed up our plans!\cI was going to rip off something\nto make up for it, but...\cJust you wait!\nYou'll get yours one day!
Awww, come on!\nYou have to take this and let me go!
A blue fluid is spiraling inside a\nglass vessel.\c“This is an experiment to create a\nWHIRLPOOL artificially using wind.”
A red ball is bobbing up and down\ninside a glass vessel.\c“This is an experiment simulating a\nWATERFALL using the ball's buoyancy.”
It's a sample of soil from the ocean\nfloor.\c“Over many years, the remains of\nlife-forms settle at the bottom of\rthe sea making sedimentary layers.\c“By analyzing these layers, the\nancient past is revealed.”
It's a sample of beach sand.\c“Stones from mountains are washed\ndown by rivers where they are\rchipped and ground down.\c“They are reduced to grains and end\nup as sand on beaches.”
“OCEANIC MINI FACT 1\nWhy is seawater blue?\c“Light is composed of many colors.\c“When light passes through water,\nmost kinds of light lose color.\c“However, blue light retains its\ncolor, making the sea appear blue.”
“OCEANIC MINI FACT 2\nWhy is the sea salty?\c“Seawater contains dissolved salt in\nthe form of sodium and chlorine ions.\c“These ions leach out of rocks and are\ncarried out to sea by rain.\c“The concentration of dissolved salt\nmakes the sea salty.”
“OCEANIC MINI FACT 3\nWhich is bigger? The sea or land?\c“The sea covers about 70% of the\nplanet, and the rest is land.\c“The sea is therefore more than twice\nthe size of land.”
It's a fossil with wavy ridges on it.\c“Soil on the ocean floor gets scoured\nby the tide.\c“The flowing seawater marks the soil\nwith small ridges and valleys.\c“If this soil becomes fossilized, it is\ncalled a ripple mark.”
A strange machine is rotating under\na glass dome.\cMaybe it's for measuring the depth\nof something...
Yes? If you're looking for STERN,\nthat would be me.\cAh! That must be the part I\nordered from MR. STONE of DEVON.\cThank you! That's great!\nWe can prepare for our expedition now.
Hehehe, hold it!\nWe'll take those parts!
CAPT. STERN: Wh-what?\nWho are you people?
We're TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]!\cOur BOSS wants those parts!\nShut your yap and fork them over!
Awaaaah!\nA kid beat me!
Oh, man, what a disaster...\nThe BOSS is going to be furious...
Humph, sniveling wimp!\nLet me take care of this!
What?!\nI lost, too!
Now what? If we don't get the parts,\nwe're in for it!\cArrgh, I didn't count on being meddled\nwith by some meddling kid!
I came to see what was taking so\nlong to snatch some parts, and you\rsimps are held up by a mere child?
I am TEAM AQUA's ARCHIE.\cTell me, why do you meddle in the\nnoble affairs of TEAM AQUA?\cPOKéMON, people, all life depends on\nthe sea.\cSo, TEAM AQUA is dedicated to the\nexpansion of the sea.\cDon't you agree? What we are doing\nis a magnificent undertaking.\cAh, fine...\nYou're still too young.\cIt can't be helped that you do not\nunderstand our ideals.\cBut, if you ever oppose us again,\nthere will be consequences!\cHeed my warning!\nFarewell!
I am TEAM MAGMA's MAXIE.\cWhy on earth do you feel compelled\nto mess up TEAM MAGMA's plans?\cPOKéMON, people, all life exists on land...\cThat's why TEAM MAGMA is trying to\nexpand the world's landmass.\cDon't you agree? What we are doing\nis a magnificent undertaking.\cWell, no matter...\nYou're young.\cYour inability to understand our\nnoble cause can't be helped...\cBut, if you were to impede us ever\nagain, you'll see no mercy from us!\cKeep that firmly in mind!\nFarewell!
CAPT. STERN: You're...\nAh, okay, you're [PLAYER][KUN]...\cAnyway, that was a tense situation!\nThank you for saving us!\cOh, yes, I almost forgot that you\neven brought the parts from DEVON!
[PLAYER] handed over the DEVON GOODS\nto CAPT. STERN.
CAPT. STERN: Whoops!\nThere's no time to lose!\cWe have to set out on our ocean floor\nexpedition really soon.\cThanks, and excuse me!
I saw a model of a ship here.\cIt reminded me of the ABANDONED SHIP\nnear DEWFORD TOWN...
Don't you dare run around inside\nthe MUSEUM!
Wow, the submarine's awesome!\nI want to go for a ride!
“KANTO WATER QUALITY SAMPLE,” the\nlabel says.\cThe sea is all connected, but the\nwater seems to differ by region.
“JOHTO WATER QUALITY SAMPLE,” the\nlabel says.\cMaybe the water's saltiness differs\nfrom one region to another...
A rubber ball is expanding and shrinking.\c“In the sea, the weight of water itself\nexerts pressure.\c“In shallow water, the pressure is not\nvery heavy.\c“However, in extremely deep water,\nthe pressure can reach even tens of\rthousands of tons on a small area.”
“MODEL OF HOENN REGION”\cIt's a miniature diorama of the\nHOENN region.\cWhere is LITTLEROOT TOWN on this?
It's a display on the flow of seawater.\c“Near the bottom of the sea, water\nflows due to differences in such\rfactors as temperature and salinity.”
It's a display on the flow of\nseawater.\c“Toward the surface, seawater flows\nas currents driven by the winds.”

“S.S. ANNE\c“A replica of the luxury liner that\ncircles the globe.”
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\cI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present...
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET...\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
BATTLE TOWER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
A journey to the bottom of the sea...\nI wonder what it'd be like?\cI'd love to go deep underwater like\nthat some day.
I wanted to go with CAPT. STERN on\nthe ocean floor exploration.\cBut the sub's too small for me.\cIf I squeezed in, there wouldn't be\nany room for the CAPTAIN...
CAPT. STERN: Those thugs...\cThey're the same lot who tried to rob\nthe DEVON GOODS at the MUSEUM.
[EVIL_LEADER]: Fwahahaha...\nI commiserate with you!\cAll that effort you spent following\nme here all the way from MT. PYRE.\cBut now...\nNo one can stop us! No one!\cOr, will you follow us back to our\nHIDEOUT in LILYCOVE CITY?\cFwahahahaha...
CAPT. STERN: Why...\cWhy would TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] steal my\nSUBMARINE EXPLORER 1?\cThey can't be after the slumbering\nPOKéMON at the bottom of the sea...\cBut even if I were to chase them,\nI don't stand a chance against them...
CAPT. STERN: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]...\cOkay... So TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] left before you\ncould stop them...\cOh, no, don't blame yourself.\nYou're not responsible for this.\cTrying to catch a submarine...\nIt's impossible for most people.\cYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE...\cPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY...\cA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you...
CAPT. STERN: Trying to catch a\nsubmarine...  It's impossible.\cYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE...\cPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY...\cA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you...
CAPT. STERN: Oh, yes.\nMR. BRINEY came to our SHIPYARD.\cIt won't be long now before we finish\nmaking the ferry!
CAPT. STERN: [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWe finally finished making the ferry\nS.S. TIDAL!\cWe couldn't have done it without your\nfriend MR. BRINEY.\cPlease go for a short cruise on it!
CAPT. STERN: Oh?\n[PLAYER][KUN], that item you have...\cThat's a SCANNER! That would sure\nhelp us on our explorations.\c[PLAYER][KUN], would you trade your\nSCANNER for something?\cLike say a DEEPSEATOOTH or a\nDEEPSEASCALE that I have?
CAPT. STERN: Are you certain?\nIt's useless to you, [PLAYER][KUN]...\cWell, okay, then. If you want to trade\nyour SCANNER, let me know.
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEATOOTH?
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEASCALE?
CAPT. STERN: Which one do you want?
[PLAYER] handed the SCANNER to\nCAPT. STERN.
CAPT. STERN: Thanks, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nThis will help our research a lot!
My POKéMON has a HASTY nature.\cIt has higher SPEED compared to my\nother POKéMON.\cMaybe their nature has something to\ndo with the stat gains of POKéMON.
You need a CONTEST PASS to enter a\nCONTEST.\cIt's easy to get. They give it to\nanyone who has POKéMON.
Oh, a CONTEST PASS!\nYou're going to be a contestant?
Want a tip for battling?\cI'd say it's raising different kinds\nof POKéMON in a balanced manner.\cIt's no good to make just one\nPOKéMON strong.\cIf it has a type disadvantage, it\nmight not stand a chance.
I trade POKéMON with my friends.\cIf a traded POKéMON is holding an\nitem, it makes me twice as happy!
The MARKET does have some interesting\nmerchandise.\cBut there are some items you can only\nget at a POKé MART.
A GREAT BALL is better than a POKé BALL\nat catching POKéMON.\cWith this, I should be able to get that\nelusive POKéMON...
Hey, how's it going, the CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cWATTSON, the LEADER of MAUVILLE\nGYM, uses ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.\cIf you challenge him with WATER-type\nPOKéMON, he'll zap them! Bzzt!\cAnd, he's put in switch-controlled doors\nall over his GYM! Eccentric!\cHey, go for it!
Whoa, you're electrifying!\nYou've powered the door open!
My electric soul, it'll shatter your\ndreams whole, whoah-yeahah!
That was plugged in, amped up,\nover-driven electric, man!
POKéMON and rock, it's all about heart,\nwhoah yeah!
I trained under WATTSON!\nThere ain't no way I'd lose easily!
Unplugged and turned off...
WATTSON, our GYM LEADER, has been\naround for a long, long time.\cHe was battling even before your\ndaddy was born, that tough coot.
This GYM's got puzzles!\nIsn't it fun?
It's no fun to lose...
WATTSON says he likes setting up\nlittle traps with switches.
With my charm and my POKéMON's moves,\nyou'll be shocked!
I'm shocked by your power!
I've heard that MAUVILLE was founded\nby WATTSON.\cHe was a TRAINER long before we\nbecame TRAINERS.\rHe must know all sorts of things!
I've given up on my plans to convert\nthe city, I have.\cAnd so, I put my time into making\ndoor traps in my GYM.\cOh? Now, what are you doing here?\cWhat's that? You say you've gotten\npast all my rigged doors?\cWahahahah!\nNow, that is amusing!\cThen, I, WATTSON, the LEADER of\nMAUVILLE GYM, shall electrify you!
Wahahahah!\nFine, I lost!\cYou ended up giving me a thrill!\nTake this BADGE!
[PLAYER] received the DYNAMO BADGE\nfrom WATTSON.
With the DYNAMO BADGE, POKéMON can\nuse ROCK SMASH out of battle.\cAnd, it will make your POKéMON a little\nbit faster, too.\cHmm...\nYou should take this, too!
That TM34 there contains SHOCK WAVE.\cIt's a trustworthy move that never\nmisses! You can count on it!
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising\nyoung TRAINER like you!
Wahahahah!\nGo forth and endeavor, youngster!

RYDEL: Your RUNNING SHOES...\nThey're awfully filthy.\cDid you come from far away?
RYDEL: Is that right?\cThen, I guess you have no need for\nany of my BIKES.
RYDEL: Hm, hm... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cYou're saying that you came all this\nway from LITTLEROOT?\cMy goodness!\nThat's ridiculously far!\cIf you had one of my BIKES, you could\ngo anywhere easily while feeling the\rgentle caress of the wind!\cI'll tell you what!\nI'll give you a BIKE!\cOh, wait a second!\cI forgot to tell you that there are\ntwo kinds of BIKES!\cThey are the MACH BIKE and the\nACRO BIKE!\cMACH BIKE is for cyclists who want\nto feel the wind with their bodies!\cAnd an ACRO BIKE is for those who\nprefer technical rides!\cI'm a real sweetheart, so you can\nhave whichever one you like!\cWhich one will you choose?
[PLAYER] chose the MACH BIKE.
[PLAYER] chose the ACRO BIKE.
RYDEL: If you get the urge to switch\nBIKES, just come see me!
RYDEL: Oh? Were you thinking about\nswitching BIKES?
RYDEL: Okay, no problem!\nI'll switch BIKES for you!
[PLAYER] got the MACH BIKE exchanged\nfor an ACRO BIKE.
[PLAYER] got the ACRO BIKE exchanged\nfor a MACH BIKE.
RYDEL: Good, good!\nI'm happy that you like it!
Oh? What happened to that BIKE I\ngave you?\cOh, I get it, you stored it using your PC.\cWell, take it out of PC storage,\nand I'll be happy to exchange it!\cMay the wind always be at your back\non your adventure!
I'm learning about BIKES while\nI work here.\cIf you need advice on how to ride your\nBIKE, there're a couple handbooks in\rthe back.
It's a handbook on the MACH BIKE.\cWhich page do you want to read?
A BIKE moves in the direction that\nthe + Control Pad is pressed.\cIt will speed up once it gets rolling.\cTo stop, release the + Control Pad.\nThe BIKE will slow to a stop.\cWant to read a different page?
A MACH BIKE is speedy, but it can't\nstop very quickly.\cIt gets a little tricky to get around\na corner.\cRelease the + Control Pad a little\nbefore the corner and slow down.\cWant to read a different page?
There are small sandy slopes throughout\nthe HOENN region.\cThe loose, crumbly sand makes it\nimpossible to climb normally.\cBut if you have a MACH BIKE, you can\nzip up a sandy slope.\cWant to read a different page?
It's a handbook on the ACRO BIKE.\cWhich page do you want to read?
Press the B Button while riding, and the\nfront wheel lifts up.\cYou can zip around with the front\nwheel up using the + Control Pad.\cThis technique is called a wheelie.\cWant to read a different page?
Keeping the B Button pressed, your\nBIKE can hop on the spot.\cThis technique is called a bunny hop.\cYou can ride while hopping, too.\cWant to read a different page?
Press the B Button and the + Control\nPad at the same time to jump.\cPress the + Control Pad to the side\nto jump sideways.\cPress it backwards to make the BIKE\nchange directions while jumping.\cWant to read a different page?
Woohoo, your POKéMON look pretty\nstrong.\cI like that!\nHere, take this HM!
That HM contains ROCK SMASH.\cIf you come across large boulders\nthat block your path...\cWell, use that HM move and smash\nit right out of your way!
Oh, yes, if you smash a rock, a POKéMON\ncould come flying out.
This is MAUVILLE GAME CORNER.
Okay, you wanted some COINS for\nthe games?\cBut you don't have a COIN CASE for\nstowing the COINS.
Were you looking for COINS?\cIt's $1000 for 50 COINS.\nWould you like some?
Thank you very much!\nHere are your COINS!
Um... You don't appear to have\nenough money...
Oh?\nYour COIN CASE is full.
Oh... You don't need COINS, then?\nGood luck on your adventure!
It's $1,000 for 50 COINS.\nWould you like some?
Welcome.\cYou can exchange your COINS for\nprizes here.
Which prize would you like?
So your choice is [STR_VAR_1]?
Thank you!\nWe'll send it to your PC at home.
You don't have enough COINS.
There isn't any room available for\nplacing [STR_VAR_1].
Oh, is that so? \nYou need to save some COINS before\rcoming back here.
Here you go!
Oh, you can't carry any more than that.
I made a mistake and got two of the\nsame DOLLS.\cWould you like one of them?
There you go!
Huh?\nYou want it, but not right now?
Oh, don't be so negative!\nYou can have this!
There's a prize I want, but I can't win\nthe jackpot.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a COIN CASE.\cI think the young lady next door\nhad one. Go see her!
My luck can only last so long.\nThis is too much for me.\rHere, take some COINS!
MAUVILLE has something for\neveryone.\cFor me, it's the GAME CORNER.
The ROULETTE tables have different\nrates.\cCheck your COINS if you're going to\npick a table.
It's easy to lose track of time in here. \nI should get back to work.
COINS are needed to play here in the\nGAME CORNER.
This ROULETTE thing...\nIt's rather demanding.\cWin or lose, it's only by luck.
Up to three COINS can be used to play\nthe SLOTS.
It's very difficult to make it stop\nright on “7.”\cIf it stops on “7” during the REEL TIME\nbonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.
Here's some information for you\nabout the SLOTS.\cThe more lightning bolts you stock, the\nmore REEL TIME chances you get.\cIn a game with the maximum five REEL\nTIME chances...\cIt is possible to receive four regular\nbonuses, then a big bonus.\cThe big bonus is 660 COINS, but it's\nvery difficult to get.
You can't play if you don't have a\nCOIN CASE.
If I had a BIKE, it'd be easy to cycle to\nSLATEPORT for some shopping.\cI'd be able to buy HARBOR MAIL at the\nPOKéMON MART in SLATEPORT...
Oh! You have HARBOR MAIL?\nWill you trade it for a COIN CASE?
Oh, I'm so happy!\nOkay, I'll trade you a COIN CASE!
That COIN CASE can be used at the\nGAME CORNER.
Oh, that's disappointing.\cA COIN CASE is needed for the\nGAME CORNER.
That man over there, he says weird\nthings!\cHe's funny in a weird way.\nI doubt I'll forget about him!
When I accessed the RECORD CORNER,\nthe data for what's hot in DEWFORD\rgot updated.\cNow that bit of data is the same\nas my friend's!
A RECORD CORNER opened upstairs in\nthe POKéMON CENTER.\cI don't know what it's about, but it\nsounds fun. I'll go check it out!
Did you know that you can link battle\nat the COLOSSEUM here?\cThey put up your record on the wall\nfor everyone to see.\cIt's embarrassing if you lose more\noften than you win...
There are items that temporarily\nelevate the stats of POKéMON.\cThe ones I know you use in battle\nare X ATTACK and X DEFEND...\cI do believe that there are others\nlike them.
Use a certain move, or use an item\ninstead...\cThe TRAINER's decisions determine how\nbattles turn out, I think.
Hello and welcome to the DEVON\nCORPORATION.\cWe're proud producers of items and\nmedicine that enhance your life.
One of our research staff stupidly\ngot robbed of an important parcel.
Hey, those RUNNING SHOES!\nThey're one of our products!\cIt makes me happy when I see someone\nusing something we made.
That stolen parcel...\cWell, sure it's important, but it's not\nanything that anyone can use.\cIn my estimation, that robber must not\nhave been very bright.
It sounds like they've recovered\nthe ripped-off DEVON GOODS.
I'm sorry, only authorized people\nare allowed to enter here.
It's beyond stupid.\nHow could we get robbed?
Hi, there!\nYou're always welcome here!
We're developing a device for talking\nwith POKéMON.\cBut we haven't had much success...
I'm developing new kinds of\nPOKé BALLS...\cBut I haven't made much headway...
We finally made new kinds of POKé BALLS!\cThe REPEAT BALL makes it easier to\ncatch POKéMON you'd caught before.\cThe TIMER BALL gets better at catching\nPOKéMON the longer a battle runs.\cBoth are proudly developed by the\nDEVON CORPORATION.\cPlease give them a try!
I made the POKéNAV!\cAs an engineer, I feel blessed to have\nmade something so great!
Oh, wow!\nThat's a POKéNAV!\cIt came about as a result of our\nPRESIDENT's desire to learn about\rthe feelings of POKéMON.\cWould you like me to describe its\nfeatures in detail?\cNo, no. I think you'll find out just by\ntrying the POKéNAV out.
I'm trying to develop a device that\nvisually reproduces the dreams of\rPOKéMON...\cBut it's not going well.
I've been trying to develop a device\nthat resurrects POKéMON from fossils...\cAnd, it's working!
Wait! That thing you have there...\nIs that a POKéMON fossil?\cWould you like to bring that POKéMON\nback to life?\cI can with my newly developed\nFOSSIL REGENERATOR.
Oh, is that so?\cDEVON's technological expertise\nis outstanding, I tell you.
Excellent!\nLet's do this right away.\c[PLAYER] handed the [STR_VAR_1] to\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.
The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made,\nis incredible.\cBut it has one drawback - it takes\na long time to work.\cSo, uh... How about you go for a stroll\nand look around for a while?
Thanks for waiting!\cYour fossilized POKéMON has been\nbrought back to life!\cThe fossil was an ancient POKéMON.\n[STR_VAR_2], it was!
[PLAYER] received [STR_VAR_2] from\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.
Uh-oh, you've got too many POKéMON.\nYou have no room for this one.
I'm MR. STONE, the PRESIDENT of\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\cI'd just got word about you!\cYou saved our staff not just once,\nbut twice!\cI have a favor to ask of an amazing\nperson like you.\cI understand that you're delivering\na package to SLATEPORT's SHIPYARD.\cWell, on the way, could you stop off in\nDEWFORD TOWN?\cI was hoping that you'd deliver a LETTER\nto STEVEN in DEWFORD.
MR. STONE: Now, you should know that\nI am a great PRESIDENT.\cSo, I'd never be so cheap as to ask\na favor for nothing in return.\cThat's why I want you to have this!
[PLAYER] received a POKéNAV.
MR. STONE: That device...\cIt's a POKéMON NAVIGATOR, or POKéNAV\nfor short.\cIt's an indispensable tool for any\nTRAINER on an adventure.\cIt has a map of the HOENN region.\cYou can check the locations of\nDEWFORD and SLATEPORT easily!
MR. STONE: I'm counting on you!
MR. STONE: You delivered my LETTER?\nThank you kindly!\cThis is my way of thanking you.\nIt should help you, a TRAINER.
MR. STONE: A POKéMON holding that\nEXP. SHARE will be given some of the\rEXP Points from battle.\cIt will get EXP Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\cI would say EXP. SHARE is quite useful\nfor raising weak POKéMON.
MR. STONE: Since my youth, I've immersed\nmyself in work.\cConsequently, I'm not familiar with\ntrends and that sort of thing.\cBut do young people all want to be\nTRAINERS in the POKéMON LEAGUE?
This is the DEVON CORPORATION's\nthird floor.\cOur PRESIDENT's OFFICE is on this floor.\cAnyway, I can't tell you how much I'm\ngrateful for what you've done.\cUm... By the way, that parcel you got\nback for us...\cCould I get you to deliver that to the\nSHIPYARD in SLATEPORT?\cIt would be awful if those robbers\ntried to take it again.\cUh... Hehehe, so, uh, could I count\non you to do that for me?\cOh, that's right.\nCould you wait here a second?
Our PRESIDENT would like to have\na word with you.\cPlease come with me.
Please, go ahead.
If you visit the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT,\nyou should go see CAPT. STERN.
DEVON's new products, the REPEAT BALL\nand TIMER BALL, have become hugely\rpopular among TRAINERS.
It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by the PRESIDENT.
Yo, how's it going?\cListen, my friend!\nWould you like to become the CHAMPION?\cI'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can\nsure give you winning advice.\cThat's settled, then! We'll aim for the\nPOKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!\cIt's your job as a TRAINER to collect\nGYM BADGES, am I right?\cBut GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!\cAnd that's where I come in!\nI'm here to provide expert advice!\cROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user\nof ROCK-type POKéMON.\cThe ROCK type is very durable, but\nit can't stand WATER-type and\rGRASS-type moves.\cCome see me afterwards, if you beat\nthe GYM LEADER.\cWell, go for it!
Whoa! What a breathtaking victory!\nMy cheering must've worked!\cGreat!\nCheck your TRAINER CARD.\cThe STONE BADGE you got should be\nproperly recorded on it.\cIn other words...\cYou've climbed the first step on\nthe stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!\cThat's got to feel awesome!
Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly!\nI'll show you why we're better!
You were too good for me...
You haven't seen anything of the ROCK\ntype's terrifying power!
If you can't beat me, you won't stand\na chance against ROXANNE!
Wow! You've got some potential!
ROXANNE is stronger than me by\nseveral times.\cYou'd better be on your guard!
Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO\nPOKéMON GYM LEADER.\cI became a GYM LEADER so that I may\napply what I learned at the POKéMON\rTRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.\cWould you kindly demonstrate how you\nbattle, and with which POKéMON?
So...\nI lost...\cIt seems that I still have much more\nto learn...\cI understand.\cThe POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state\nthat TRAINERS are to be given this\rif they defeat a GYM LEADER.\cPlease accept the official POKéMON\nLEAGUE STONE BADGE.
[PLAYER] received the STONE BADGE\nfrom ROXANNE.
The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK\npower of your POKéMON.\cIt also enables them to use the HM move\nCUT outside of battle.\cPlease take this with you, too.
That TM39 contains ROCK TOMB.\cIt not only inflicts damage by dropping\nrocks, it also lowers SPEED.\cIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches\nthe move to a POKéMON.\cRemember, a TM can be used only once,\nso think before you use it.
Since you are so strong, you should\nchallenge other GYM LEADERS.\cBy battling many TRAINERS, you should\nlearn many things.
RUSTBORO CITY POKéMON GYM
RUSTBORO CITY POKéMON GYM\cROXANNE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect POKéMON in battle.
Which topic do you want to read?
If a POKéMON is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\cThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\cA poisoned POKéMON's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\cHeal a poisoning using an ANTIDOTE.
If a POKéMON becomes paralyzed,\nits SPEED drops.\cIt may also not be able to move while\nit is in battle.\cParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a PARLYZ HEAL.
If a POKéMON falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\cA POKéMON may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is sleeping,\rit will stay asleep.\cWake it up using an AWAKENING.
A burn reduces ATTACK power, and it\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\cA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a BURN HEAL.
If a POKéMON is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\cIt will remain frozen after battle.\nThaw it out using an ICE HEAL.
Students who don't study get a little\ntaste of my QUICK CLAW.\cWhether or not you are a good student \nwill be evident from the way you use\rthis item.
A POKéMON holding the QUICK CLAW will\noccasionally speed up and get to move\rbefore its opponent.\cThere are many other items that are\nmeant to be held by POKéMON.\cJust those alone will give you many\ntopics to study!
I'm trading POKéMON with my friend\nright now.
I always wanted a SEEDOT, and\nI'm finally getting one!
POKéMON can hold items, but they\ndon't know what to do with man-made\ritems like POTION and ANTIDOTE.
You know how some POKéMON moves can\nconfuse a POKéMON?\cA confused POKéMON will sometimes\nattack itself without meaning to.\cBut once it leaves battle, it will\nreturn to normal.
A POKéMON holding a BERRY will heal\nitself...\cThere are many kinds of items that\nPOKéMON can hold...\cBoy, it sure is hard taking notes\ndown...
It's this student's notebook...\cPOKéMON are to be caught using\nPOKé BALLS.\cUp to six POKéMON can accompany\na TRAINER.\cA TRAINER is someone who catches\nPOKéMON, raises them, and battles\rwith them.\cA TRAINER's mission is to defeat the\nstrong TRAINERS who await challengers\rin POKéMON GYMS.
My POKéMON has a NAIVE nature, and my\nfriend's has a JOLLY nature.\cIt's fascinating how POKéMON have\npersonalities!
Just like people, there are male and\nfemale POKéMON.\cBut no one seems to have any idea how\nthey're different.
The man next door gave me an HM!\cI used it to teach my POKéMON how to\nCUT down skinny trees.
I'm buying some PARLYZ HEALS and\nANTIDOTES.\cJust in case I run into SHROOMISH\nin PETALBURG WOODS.
My POKéMON evolved.\nIt has a lot of HP now.\cI should buy SUPER POTIONS for it\ninstead of ordinary POTIONS.
I'm getting an ESCAPE ROPE just in\ncase I get lost in a cave.\cI just need to use it to get back to the\nentrance.
Every POKéMON has a special ability\nthat it can use.
POKéMON are such strange creatures.
Oh, it's so hard every day...\cWhat's hard?\nYou need to ask?\cIt's trying to figure out what to\nmake for meals every day.\cIt really isn't easy coming up with\nmeals every day.
Do you nickname your POKéMON?\nI gave a cool name to mine.\cBut when I call my POKéMON by that\nname, people laugh at me...\cIf it's okay with you, want to trade\nyour [STR_VAR_1] for my [STR_VAR_2]?
Eheheheh, ooh, this is so exciting!
But that's no [STR_VAR_1].\nTch, that's so disappointing...
Aww, it's a good POKéMON...
Don't you get curious about what other\npeople named their POKéMON?
In all sorts of places, there are all\nsorts of POKéMON and people.\cI find that fascinating, so I go to all\nsorts of places.
That determined expression...\nThat limber way you move...\rAnd your well-trained POKéMON...\cYou're obviously a skilled TRAINER!\cNo, wait, don't say a word.\nI can tell just by looking at you.\cI'm sure that you will be capable\nof putting this HM to good use.\cNo need to be modest or shy.\nGo on, take it!
That HM, it's CUT.\cAn HM move is one that can be used\nby POKéMON out of a battle.\cAny POKéMON that's learned CUT can\nchop down thin trees if the TRAINER\rhas earned the STONE BADGE.\cAnd, unlike a TM, an HM doesn't break\nafter one use.
When they were expanding the city of\nRUSTBORO, my dad helped out.\cHe made his POKéMON use CUT to clear\nthe land of trees.
The TRAINER'S SCHOOL is excellent.\cIf you study there, you could even\nbecome a GYM LEADER.
ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, really knows\na lot about POKéMON.\cShe's really strong, too!
DEVON CORPORATION's workers live in\nthis building.
SKITTY: Gyaaaah!
Way back in the old days, DEVON was just\na teeny, tiny company.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\cMy daddy made this!\nBut I can't use it, so you can have it.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\cWhen I grow up, I'm going to work for\nDEVON, too.
DEVON's PRESIDENT likes to collect\nrare stones.
I think the PRESIDENT's son also\ncollects rare stones.
For my own POKéMON, I give them\nperfectly suited nicknames!\cIt's my expression of, uh...\noriginality, yes, that's it!
But giving the name PEKACHU to a\nPIKACHU? It seems pointless.\cI suppose it is good to use a name\nthat's easy to understand, but...
PEKACHU: Peka!
Hi, there's this POKéMON that I'm\nlooking for.\cI want a [STR_VAR_1].\nDo you have one?\cWould you trade it for my [STR_VAR_2]?
Thank you!\cI'll be good to your [STR_VAR_1],\nso please be nice to my [STR_VAR_2]!
Wait!\nThat POKéMON isn't a [STR_VAR_1].\cI guess you don't want to trade\nwith me.
Oh, okay. If you change your mind,\nplease come see me.\cI'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me!\cI really wanted this POKéMON, so\nI promise to take good care of it!
Trading POKéMON with others...\cIt's as if you're trading your own\nmemories with other people.
ZIGZAGOON: Gumomoh?
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cFORTREE GYM LEADER WINONA is a\nmaster of FLYING-type POKéMON.\cShe's waiting at the back of this GYM,\nbehind the rotating doors.\cShe's waiting for new challengers who\nare trying to take wing!\cOkay, go for it!
You did it!\nYou've achieved liftoff!
Behold the elegant battle style of\nBIRD POKéMON!
You...\nYou're strong...
A TRAINER has to be smart to keep\nup with unexpected turns of events.\cLet's see if you have the smarts to\nget to our LEADER?
The lovers of BIRD POKéMON aspire\nto join this GYM.\cAs a member of the FORTREE GYM,\nI'm not allowed to lose!
It was too much of a load for me\nto bear...
The world is huge, and there are\ncountless tough TRAINERS.\cI'm going to keep training and make\nmyself even stronger.
There's no need for WINONA, our GYM\nLEADER, to deal with you!\cI'm plenty good enough for you!
WINONA, I...\nI lost!
WINONA is cute and she's strong.\nShe's the ultimate LEADER!\cBlush...
WINONA taught me personally!\nYou can't beat me easily!
I was beaten...
Thanks to WINONA, the people of\nFORTREE can live without fear.
I am WINONA. I am the LEADER of the\nFORTREE POKéMON GYM.\cI have become one with BIRD POKéMON\nand have soared the skies...\cHowever grueling the battle, we have\ntriumphed with grace...\cWitness the elegant choreography\nof BIRD POKéMON and I!
Never before have I seen a TRAINER\ncommand POKéMON with more grace\rthan I...\cIn recognition of your prowess,\nI present to you this GYM BADGE.
[PLAYER] received the FEATHER BADGE\nfrom WINONA.
With the FEATHER BADGE, all POKéMON up\nto LV 70, even those received through\rtrades, will obey your every command.\cYou will also be able to use the\nHM move FLY outside of battle.\cAnd this...\nThis is a gift from me.
TM40 contains AERIAL ACE.\cIts speed...\nNo POKéMON should be able to avoid it.
Though I fell to you, I will remain\ndevoted to BIRD POKéMON.
FORTREE CITY POKéMON GYM
FORTREE CITY POKéMON GYM\cWINONA'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
Listen, kid, are you working\non a POKéDEX?\cHmm... Go to the SAFARI ZONE.\nThat's my suggestion.
Have you done anything at the\nRECORD CORNER?\cIt's pretty neat. It mixes and matches\nthe records of TRAINERS.\cI don't know quite how it works,\nbut it's cool. It's exciting, even!
Hey, you've got a POKéNAV!\nIt's the same as mine.\cCheck out the TRAINER'S EYES on it.\cIt shows you TRAINERS who want a\nrematch with you.\cIsn't it great?\nYou have to hand it to DEVON!
SUPER REPEL lasts a long time, and\nit gets the job done.\cIt's much better than an ordinary\nREPEL.
I always stock up on more items than\nI'm sure I'll need.\cYou never know what might happen.\nBetter to be safe than sorry!
A RARE CANDY makes a POKéMON grow\nimmediately by one level.
People... POKéMON...\cTheir hidden powers are aroused by\nliving in natural environments...
Let this old woman see if your hidden\npower has awoken...\cI hold a coin in my hand.\cNow, tell me, have I palmed it in the\nright hand? Or in the left?
Oh! Yes, correct!\cWe shall try again.\cIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left?
Oh! Yes, correct again!\cWe shall try once more.\cIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left? Choose!
Oh! Splendid!\nYour hidden power has awoken!\cHere, take this and awaken the hidden\npower of your POKéMON.
HIDDEN POWER is a move that changes\nwith the POKéMON.
No, too bad.\nYou guessed wrong.
The area around FORTREE CITY is like\na jungle.\cIt gets awfully tiring walking around\nthis city.\cThat's why I use FLY to instantly go to\nany city I've visited.
Speaking of POKéDEXES, I remembered\nsomething.\cI met this TRAINER, STEVEN, when\nI was searching for rare stones.\cHoo, boy, he had some amazing POKéMON\nwith him.\cThey weren't just rare, they were\ntrained to terrifying extremes!\cHe might even be stronger than the\nGYM LEADER in this town...
What's that thing you have there?\c... ... ... ... ... ...\cOh, it's called a POKéDEX?\nIt's really awesome!
By being together with POKéMON,\npeople make more and more friends.\cAnd that brings the world closer\ntogether. I think it's wonderful!
There!\nGo, BIRD POKéMON!
Heheh, I asked my WINGULL to run an\nerrand for me.
Good!\nWelcome back, WINGULL!\cHuh? What is this?\nWhat is it holding?\cA MENTAL HERB?\nIt must have picked it up somewhere.\cBut I'm not a TRAINER, so you can\nhave it.
Thanks to my WINGULL, I have friends\nwho live far away.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The tree houses of FORTREE are great!\cI think it's the number one town for\nliving together with POKéMON.
POKéMON and people have adapted to\nnature to survive.\cThere's no need to make nature\nconform to the way we want to live.
ZIGZAGOON: Bufuu!
Merchandise you buy here is sent to\nyour own PC.\cThat's fantastic! I wish they could\nalso deliver me home like that.
I'm buying a pretty desk and I'm\nputting my cute DOLLS on it.\cIf I don't, when I decorate my\nSECRET BASE, my DOLLS will get\rdirty or poked with splinters.
Hm, so they doubled the guests by\nusing POKéMON as attractions?\cHm, well, maybe I should make a cute\nPOKéMON our inn's mascot.\cI wonder if that will attract more\nguests to stay with us?
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\cSince that TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] came to town,\nthe tourists have been staying away.
Hey, down in front!\nI can't see the TV!
Amazing! You're telling me a POKéMON\nfound someone's lost item?\cThat's something. If we had some smart\nPOKéMON like that...\cWe could recover anything that our\nguests mislaid...
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\cI heard that someone busted the\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM] HIDEOUT.\cThanks to that, we just booked a\nreservation from a big group.\cIt was a company called... Uh...\nGAME something...
Amazing! A house-sitting POKéMON\ncaught a burglar?\cThat's something. If we had a tough\nPOKéMON as a security guard...\cWe would be able to provide our guests\nwith greater safety.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV.\cOh, yes. A big group of guests arrived\na little while ago.\cThey booked in as GAME FREAK, so I\nguess they must make games.\cUh-oh, I'd better get working on\ntheir dinner!
I'm the GAME DESIGNER.\cOh, is that right?\nYou're working on a POKéDEX?\cIt's tough trying to complete it,\nbut don't give up.\cIf you do complete it, please come\nshow me.
Wow! That's awesome!\nYep, it's totally awesome!\cThis POKéDEX is completely filled!\nYou really must love POKéMON!\cI'm so impressed!\cLet me give you something in\nrecognition of your feat!
Me? You're talking to me?\nI'm the PROGRAMMER.\cI wonder what the SLOTS are\nlike here.
I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the\nPOKéMON of HOENN interesting?
The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey?\nTo battle against a cute TUBER...\cWhoop, it drives me wild!\cAnd the TWINS! Aren't they cute?\nA 2-on-2 battle with TWINS...\cWhoop, it's unbearably fun!
The sea breeze tickles my heart.\nIt feels wonderful here!
You never know when and where\npeople will challenge you.\cThat's why I never leave home without\nmy GAME BOY ADVANCE.
Welcome to LILYCOVE MUSEUM.\cPlease take the time to enjoy our\ncollection of fantastic artwork\rfeaturing POKéMON.
I'm the CURATOR of this MUSEUM of\nfine arts.\cIt's heartening to see someone so\nyoung as you in our MUSEUM.\cHave you viewed our collection of\npaintings already?
Ah, then let me not disturb you.\nPlease, do take your time.
Oh? I do believe that you seem to\nbe a POKéMON TRAINER.\cHave you an interest in paintings,\ntoo?
I see...\cI'm honored that you would visit\nus in spite of that.
Ah, excellent!\nYou do like paintings!\cThen, may I ask you to come with me?
It's a very old painting.\nThe paint is peeling here and there.
It's an odd landscape with bizarre\nand fantastic scenery.
It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling\nwoman with a POKéMON on her lap.
It's a painting of a legendary POKéMON\nfrom long ago.\cThe artist painted this from\nimagination.
It's a painting of GRASS POKéMON\nswaying in a breeze.\cThey appear to be enjoying the wind's\ngentle caress.
It's a delicious-looking painting\nof BERRIES.\cThis painting could make you hungry!
It's a replica of a famous sculpture.\cIt depicts an ancient BIRD POKéMON.
It's a big POKé BALL carved from a\nblack stone.\cIt was apparently used in festivals\nin the olden days.
It's a huge stone tablet inscribed\nwith POKéMON and dense text in the\rsmall characters of an ancient,\runreadable language.
Hmmm...\nWhat works of great magnificence...
Battling with POKéMON is fun,\nI'll grant you that.\cBut one mustn't forget our love for\nthe fine arts.
This ART MUSEUM... Well, you could\nsee many fantastic paintings.\cAnd the CURATOR is a wonderful person.\cAmong artists like myself, this MUSEUM\nis an inspiration.
This lady is pretty!\nShe's like Mommy!
This POKéMON is adorable!\nJust like our little boy!
I'd heard that this ART MUSEUM got\nin some new paintings.\cSo, naturally I hurried over.\cAre the new paintings up on the\nsecond floor?
Lately, the CURATOR has been\nunusually cheerful.\cI bet something good happened for him.\nDefinitely.
I aim to see many great paintings\nhere and learn from them.\cI have this dream of one day having\nmy artwork exhibited here.
The ART MUSEUM has become a favorite\ntourist destination.\cIt's great for LILYCOVE...\nNo, great for the HOENN region!\cThis is what I've heard - a lone TRAINER\nprocured all the paintings upstairs.
This is our special exhibit hall.
As you can plainly see, there is not a\nsingle painting on exhibit.\cHere, I don't wish to exhibit works of\nso-called classical art.\cSuch classical works you can see on\nour ground floor.\cI wish to exhibit work that is far\ndifferent from the classics.\cArt, after all, is not restricted to old,\nfamous works!\cThis exhibit hall, I wish to fill it with...\cModern and vibrant artworks of\nPOKéMON seemingly ready to spring\rforth into glorious life!
I beg your pardon. I didn't intend\nto monopolize the conversation.\cNow, as you are young, and yet\nobviously well traveled...\cYou must encounter lively POKéMON\nand works of art depicting them.\cIf you were to come across such a\npainting, may we ask you to obtain\rthe artist's permission to exhibit\rit here?
I wish to fill this exhibit hall with\nmodern and vibrant paintings of\rPOKéMON.
Thanks to you, we've added a new\npainting to our collection!\cI've heard it depicts your POKéMON.\nTruly magnificent!\cThank you so very, very much!
Ah! It's you!\n[PLAYER]!
Isn't this marvelous?\nThis collection of paintings!\cEach one of them flawless!\nNone better than another!\cThese paintings have attracted\nmore guests to our ART MUSEUM.\cSincerely, I thank you, [PLAYER].\nThis is my dream come true!
This is merely a token of my gratitude.
[PLAYER] received a GLASS ORNAMENT.
I will keep this for you until we\nmeet again.
Ah, so good to see you, [PLAYER]!\cIt's an honor to have you visit us\non your busy journeys.\cPlease, relax and do enjoy your\nvisit with us.
It's a picture frame with pink-colored\nadornments.
It's a picture frame with yellow-colored\nadornments.
It's a picture frame with blue-colored\nadornments.
It's a picture frame with red-colored\nadornments.
It's a picture frame with green-colored\nadornments.
It's a painting of POKéMON.
I've been away awhile, so the new\npaintings up here surprised me.\cI wish someone would paint my POKéMON\nthis pretty.
Well... So this is where they show the\ntopical POKéMON paintings.\cI see, these new paintings are indeed\nrather amusing.
Wow, is that right?\nThese paintings are of your POKéMON.\cIsn't that just the ultimate joy for\na TRAINER?

Congratulations!\cI did a painting of your POKéMON to\ncommemorate its victory...\cWell, your POKéMON's appeals were\nso fantastic, it spurred me into\rpainting better than I usually do.\rLook, see?
The screen switches to display the\npainting.
What do you think? I'm confident in\nwhat I've done, but do you like it?\cA work of this caliber, it wouldn't look\nout of place in an art museum.\cHuh? An art museum really is looking\nfor paintings?\cDo you think I should take this there?
What, really? Then, sure, I will take\nthis painting there right now.\cI'll give it a proper title, too.\cI hope they'll like it and consider\nexhibiting this.\cPlease check if they did accept this.\nThank you!
Oh, that's right!\cAs a memento of me painting your\nPOKéMON, please take this.
[PLAYER] received a RIBBON.
[PLAYER] put the RIBBON on\n[STR_VAR_1].
Okay, see you!
Oh... Then, I guess I'll just take\nthis home with me...\cBut, you know, I would like to take\nthis to the art museum... Okay?
Oh, fine, that's the way it is.\nI will hang this in my own house.\cI'll just have to try harder next time.\nWell, be seeing you.
Hoo, boy... Master Rank CONTESTS,\nhere I come.\cThe world will know that my dearest\nPOKéMON is the cutest being in all\rexistence. The time has come!\rUheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of\nPOKéMON here.\cThat's why I make this place a regular\npart of my daily stroll.
Oh, dear! They still haven't given\nyou a CONTEST PASS?\cYou should go get one in VERDANTURF\nTOWN right away.\cIt's such a thrill having others see\nPOKéMON that you've raised with care\rand love.
When you get up to the Master Rank\nCONTESTS, you get your eyes opened\rto striking POKéMON that just scream\rto be painted.
The TOUGHNESS CONTEST is like\nextreme, man!\cThose muscular appeals...\nCascading sweat... I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care\non this POKéMON.\cIts condition is peaking.\nToday, victory is mine!
I made [POKEBLOCK]S with Mom, Dad and\nBig Sister. They turned out great!\cI bet you can make smoother, better\n[POKEBLOCK]S if you have more people.
This POKéMON won the BEAUTY CONTEST\nhere before.\cWell, guess what? Today, I made it\nwin a SMARTNESS CONTEST!\cMy abilities scare even me...
I've entered a bunch of CONTESTS,\nso I'm seeing how things work.\cIf you're in a COOLNESS CONTEST,\ncool moves go over as appeals.\cBut smart moves and cute moves\ndon't go over well, for instance.
That young man who won earlier had\na whole bunch of different [POKEBLOCK]S.\cCan you win if you had that many\nof those things?
Whoa, isn't this place humongous!\cThe tension in the air... It's not\nlike a CONTEST hall in the sticks.
MC: Okay, SMART POKéMON and their\nTRAINERS, are you ready?!\cGive it your best showing!\nLet's appeal!
JUDGE: Are you enjoying this CONTEST?\cCome back with three friends, and\nall of you may enter a CONTEST!
Ayayayay...\nI entered the wrong CONTEST.\cI entered this tough POKéMON in the\nSMARTNESS CONTEST...\cCome on, wow them with a smart-looking\nROCK SMASH.
I've spent many a year, and all my\nwisdom besides, raising this POKéMON\rto be smart.\cIt won't be easily bested by some\nyoung pup's POKéMON.\cMy dear wife, are you seeing this?
There it is!\cIf my POKéMON pulls a smart move next,\nthe audience's excitement will peak!
Oh, dear, no!\cMy darling ZUBAT's LEECH LIFE is so\ncute I kept using it over and over!\cBut these mean people don't appreciate\nit at all!
Kiyaaah! You're beautiful, Grandpa!
Even when TRAINERS enter the same\nkind of POKéMON, they all seem to use\rdifferent moves for appeals.\cIt's just like the way people have\ndifferent styles for battling.
I think the POKéMON look smarter\nthan their TRAINERS. By a lot.
When all's said and done, I still love\nSMARTNESS CONTESTS.\cThat intellectual green color...\nIt's so... So... Cool.
MC: Are you entering the BEAUTY\nCONTEST, too? Good luck!
JUDGE: Ah, every POKéMON here is a\nmodel of pristine beauty!\cWhy, I almost forgot to score them!
A POKéMON this beautiful...\nThere isn't another one like it.\cEveryone's eyes will be glued to\nmy beauty.
Waaaah!\cI brushed and groomed my POKéMON\ncarefully for this CONTEST...\cBut I overdid it...\nMy POKéMON's coat turned all scraggly...\cWhat should I do?
This AURORA BEAM is so dazzling,\nthe JUDGE won't be able to see it.\cUh, wait a second...\nThat'll be meaningless, then!
This pretty POKéMON looks just like\nme when I was younger.\cRight when I said that, my husband\nspewed the coffee he was drinking.\cDid I say something funny?
You know, as a woman, if I win at a\nBEAUTY CONTEST, sure it makes me\rhappy. More than usual, anyway.
Wahahahah!\cWill you take a gander at all those\npretty POKéMON!\rI just love this sort of glitz!
You can't always win on just beauty\nalone.\cYou have to groom your POKéMON so\nit's nice and glossy like mine.
MC: Uh-oh! Hello!\nWe're in the middle of a CONTEST!\cPlease enter at our registration\ncounter and come out, okay?
JUDGE: Oh, such charming and cute\nappeals!\cOh, my goodness! What a perfectly\nadorable WATER SPORT appeal!
Oh, no... My sweet AZURILL was\ndistracted by another POKéMON.
My POKéMON has never won in a battle,\nbut put it in a CONTEST and look out!
My POKéMON's PETAL DANCE is a marvel\nof elegance.\cI won't let anyone disturb its\nperformance.
Everyone's POKéMON are very cute.\cHowever, if my POKéMON were to make\na cute appeal...\cI'm sure that it would be so much \ncuter than the others.
My child is in this CONTEST.\cCome on, dear. Go for it!\nYour POKéMON is the best!
I think that girl over there is the\ncutest of the lot.\cWhat's that? They're judging\nPOKéMON by their looks?
Ohh, seeing all these cute POKéMON,\nthey make we want to get my own!\cI'm going to go catch some!
COOLNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE CHILLED BY COOL POKéMON!
BEAUTY CONTEST STAGE\nBE ALLURED BY BEAUTIFUL POKéMON!
CUTENESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE CHARMED BY CUTE POKéMON!
SMARTNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE IMPRESSED BY SMART POKéMON!
TOUGHNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE THRILLED BY TOUGH POKéMON!
I wonder how many kinds of POKéMON\nthere are in the world?\cIt'd be great to cross seas and\ntrade POKéMON with people far away.
I've been hearing about some rotten\nscoundrels who steal POKéMON and rip\roff METEORITES.
Those rotten scoundrels who steal\nPOKéMON and rip off METEORITES...\cI haven't seen them around recently.
I'm going to get X ATTACK to raise\nATTACK during battle.\cThat way, I'll be guaranteed to win!
FULL HEAL is a little expensive,\nbut it is convenient.\cJust one of these can cure any\nPOKéMON status problem.
Oh, wow!\nIt's [PLAYER]!
I've heard the news!\nYou're really strong, aren't you?\cWe always argue about who is the\nstrongest of all TRAINERS here.\cSo when I heard about you, I decided\nto be your fan!\cI hope you'll keep on battling other\ntough TRAINERS.\cThat way, we'll be able to see more\nof your hot, hot battles.\cThat will make the others here see\nexactly how great you are.\cRemember, I'm cheering for you,\n[PLAYER]!
Yo, [PLAYER]!\nYou're the one we want to win!
The others, they don't know that\nyou're the best of the best!\cIsn't that right, [PLAYER]?\nShow them you've got guts!
I hate to say this, but the TRAINER\neverybody's talking about is\r[STR_VAR_1], no question about it!\cThat TRAINER's power...\nIt's out of the ordinary.
Darn it... I've been telling people\nthat [STR_VAR_1] is the best now...\cBut no one wants to listen...
I've been hearing things about a\ntough new TRAINER.\cThis TRAINER's supposed to be beating\nGYM LEADERS, even.\cDo you know anything about this\nnew TRAINER?
Oh!\n[PLAYER]!\cGo for it!\nI'm pulling for you!
Sigh...\nBRAWLY...\cOh, no! Wait!\nThat's not right! No, no, no!\cI'm your fan through and through!\cSo make me proud!\nGo for it!
I can't help it, I can only get to\nlike BRAWLY...
Nobody understands the charm of\nBRAWLY...\cI don't care!\cEven if I'm the only one, I'm going\nto keep cheering for BRAWLY!
Whatever anyone says, my favorite\nTRAINER is DEWFORD's GYM LEADER\rBRAWLY!
You've surpassed your own father in\nevery regard!\cI'm telling you, so there's no question\nabout it at all!
Even when things turned bleak, your\nfather never gave up.\cThis I know to be true.\cYou never give up even if you lose!\nSo keep on battling!
NORMAN battled with more power,\ncharisma, and showmanship than you.\cEven though people may say that\nyou're strong...\cYou've still got a long way to go\ncompared to your father.
You're beginning to get the same\nair of awe NORMAN exudes.\cBut there's something conclusively\ndifferent between you and NORMAN.\cI can't tell you what that is.\nYou'll have to find it yourself.
Everyone here, we're all huge fans\nof POKéMON battles.\cWe discuss who we consider to be\nthe strongest of all TRAINERS.\cIf you were to become famous, we\nmight even become your fans!
Oh, woweee! It's [PLAYER]!\nFor real, too!\cPlease, shake my hand, shake my hand!
I'll always cheer for you, [PLAYER]!\nAlways, always!\cI don't want to see you lose ever,\n[PLAYER].\cBecause I know you're really, really\nstrong, [PLAYER]!
[STR_VAR_1] is really cool...\cEveryone thinks so, right, right?
[STR_VAR_1] really is cool, don't\nyou think so?\cEven if it's just me, I'm going to keep\ncheering my favorite TRAINER.
My favorite TRAINER is...\cCool...\cStrong...\cAnd really nice...\cI wish there was a TRAINER like that...
Whoa! It's [PLAYER]!\nWicked!\cWhen I grow up, I want to be strong\nlike you, [PLAYER]!
Even if I'm the only one...\cYou'll always be the only one I\ncheer for, [PLAYER]!\cBecause I believe in you, [PLAYER]!
[STR_VAR_1] is so wickedly cool...\nI want to shake hands with my hero.
Even if I'm the only one...\cI'm never going to stop being\n[STR_VAR_1]'s fan!\cBecause I've heard, [STR_VAR_1]\nnever loses!
[PLAYER]!\nYou are amazing after all!\cEver since I set eyes on you, I knew\nthat you were great.\cIt looks like my eyes didn't deceive me.
Who cares about the others.\nI'm in your corner!\cYou don't need to worry. Just get\nout there and battle like always.
You're a pretty decent TRAINER,\nI think.\cBut I also think that [STR_VAR_1]\nis number one right now.\cThat's just my opinion.\nDon't worry about it too much.
Wow, you really are strong.\nMaybe even stronger than [STR_VAR_1].\cBut [STR_VAR_1] needs me.\cIf I don't cheer for [STR_VAR_1],\nwho will?
You've changed my mind!\nYou are strong, aren't you?\cI'd like you to tell me how you managed\nto get so strong!
The tougher the situation, the more\nattractively you battle.\cI can't wait for your next battle!
Among the recently hot TRAINERS,\n[STR_VAR_1] is the standout.\cThat toughness, it's simply not normal.\cYou're doing okay, but you're not in\nthe same class as [STR_VAR_1].
You are really popular...\cYou're strong, and you're caring to\nPOKéMON. No one can knock you.\cBut, you know, I believe in [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_1] is definitely stronger!\nI'm positive!
You...\cImpressive!
Your true worth, it is fine if only\nI recognized it.\cThe others I doubt will understand\nthe hidden power that beats within.
Yes, I see strength in your eyes.\cBut!\cYou still haven't realized your\npotential.
It is true that you are tremendously\npowerful.\cBut!\nI can tell...\cThat strength cannot be considered\ntrue strength yet!\cTrue strength is...!\n... ...\cActually, I have no idea, either.
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\cI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present...
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET...\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
BATTLE TOWER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
Until they finish making the ferry, we\nsailors have nothing to do...\cI wish they'd get a move on, the folks\nat the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT.
The ferry S.S. TIDAL is finally in\noperation.\cThe folks at the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT\nmust've worked extra hard.\cWell, it's my turn to get busy now!
Uh...\nOh, yes, I'm the MOVE DELETER.\cI can make POKéMON forget their moves.\cWould you like me to do that?
Which POKéMON should forget a move?
Which move should be forgotten?
[STR_VAR_1] seems to know only one\nmove...
Hm! [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2]?\nThat move should be forgotten?
It worked to perfection!\c[STR_VAR_1] has forgotten\n[STR_VAR_2] completely.
Come again if there are other moves\nto be forgotten.
What?\nNo EGG should know any moves.
POKéMON are partners to people.\nThey aren't our tools.\cUnfortunately, there are some people\nwho fail to understand that...
KECLEON: Ruroro?
Huh? What? What's that?\cI'm not near awake yet...\nYou can have this...
Yawn...\cSleep is essential for good health...\nSleep and regain health...
Oh, my, my! Are you traveling alone?\nBut you're so young! Good for you!\cI'm sure my kids could learn a thing\nor two from you!\cMe? I'm a master of [POKEBLOCK]S.\cIf I get serious just a little, why, I\ncan concoct great [POKEBLOCK]S.\cWould you like to learn from me, a\nmaster of [POKEBLOCK]S?
Oh? Are you sure?\cYou shouldn't always try to do\neverything by yourself, dear!
Oh, good! You're a smart soul!\nThis is a bit long, so listen up!\cAre you ready?\cIf you look at [POKEBLOCK]S, you should see\nthat they are rated on how they feel.\cThe lower the feel rating,\nthe better it is. Don't forget this!\cA good [POKEBLOCK] has a low feel\nrating and a high level.\cA POKéMON can eat more good\n[POKEBLOCK]S than ordinary ones, too.\cAnd this is important.\cIf you want to make smooth [POKEBLOCK]S,\nuse different kinds of BERRIES.\cDon't be stingy - the kinds of BERRIES\naffect the smoothness of [POKEBLOCK]S.\cAnd another thing.\cThe more people blending BERRIES, the\nsmoother the [POKEBLOCK]S.\cThat's why you should talk to other\npeople and make [POKEBLOCK]S together.\cThat's about all you need to know to\nmake good [POKEBLOCK]S.\cIf everyone had POKéMON they love,\nsmooth [POKEBLOCK]S, and a loving family,\rthe world would be a happier place.\cDon't give up, dear!
When my wife gave birth to quadruplets,\nyou bet I was shocked.\cBut, now, seeing them play together,\nit makes me happy.
We're having MULTI BATTLES, but I know\nI'm going to win.
We like mixing stuff at the RECORD\nCORNER.\cBut what gets mixed up?
We're going to make super [POKEBLOCK]S\nwith a BERRY BLENDER!
I want to brag about how tough my\nPOKéMON is, so we're going to enter a\rCONTEST together.
This planet's biggest mysteries are\nat the bottom of the sea.\cSomebody said that, but I don't know...
There's a deep underwater trench\nbetween MOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\cThat's what someone told me, anyway.
Welcome to LILYCOVE DEPARTMENT STORE.
Whenever I come to the DEPARTMENT\nSTORE, I always end up buying all sorts\rof things because it's so fun.
Today, my mom is going to buy me some\nnice furniture.
I'm buying something for my AZUMARILL\nas a reward for winning a CONTEST.
AZUMARILL: Maririroo!
1F: SERVICE COUNTER\n    LOTTERY CORNER\c2F: TRAINER'S ZONE\c3F: BATTLE COLLECTION\c4F: TM CORNER\c5F: POKé DOLL FLOOR\cROOFTOP: ROOFTOP PLAZA
Learn to use items properly.\nThat's basic, really.
My husband is waiting at home.\nWhat would make a good gift for him?
I'm leaving on a long journey soon.\nI need to stock up on items.
FOR YOUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS\n2F: TRAINER'S ZONE
For quickly toughening up POKéMON,\nitems are the best.\cPROTEIN boosts ATTACK, and CALCIUM\nraises SP. ATK.
I want my POKéMON to have more\nendurance.\cI'm trying to decide whether to raise\nDEFENSE with IRON, or SP. DEF with ZINC.
I gave a CARBOS to my POKéMON and its\nSPEED went up.
ESSENTIALS FOR UNBEATABLE TRAINERS\n3F: BATTLE COLLECTION
Hmm...\cAn attacking move...\nOr a defensive move...\cIt's no easy matter to decide which TM\nmoves should be taught to POKéMON...
There are so many different kinds of\nTM moves.\cA catalog I read said there are fifty\ndifferent kinds.
I'd like to get all the different TMs,\nbut a POKéMON learns only four moves.
A SHORTCUT TO POKéMON LEAGUE\n4F: TM CORNER
This place is full of cute DOLLS.\cI should buy some for me, instead of\njust for my children.
I'm not big enough to raise POKéMON,\nso I'm getting a cute DOLL instead.
They sell many cute MATS here.\cI wonder which one I should get?\nMaybe I'll buy them all...
ADORABLE FRIENDS\n5F: POKé DOLL FLOOR
Don't they have set dates for their\nclear-out sales?\cI watch TV, but they never show any\ncommercials.
Yes! I've been waiting a long time for\nthis clear-out sale.\cThey have items that you can only get\nhere. I'm going to load up, that I am!
Ohh... I'm bone-dry thirsty!
It's a VENDING MACHINE.\nWhich drink would you like?
Clang!\cA can of [STR_VAR_1] dropped down.
Clang!\cScore! An extra can of [STR_VAR_1]\ndropped down!
Not enough money...
Decided against buying a drink.
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-bound\n[PLAYER]?\cThe GYM LEADERS here use PSYCHIC-type\nPOKéMON.\cIf you go up against them with\nFIGHTING- or POISON-type POKéMON,\rthey'll inflict horrible damage!\cPlus, they'll come at you with\noutstanding combination attacks.\cIf you want to win, you'll need to show\nthem how tight you are with your\rPOKéMON. Go for it!
Wow, you're astounding!\nYou're one great TRAINER!
Battles hinge on the strength of your\nspirit! The weak-spirited will never win!
I lost! I must temper my spirit again!
The indecisive lose.\nThat's my warning to you.
Let me see your talent!
You possess spectacular talent!
If there are prodigies in the world,\nthen our GYM LEADERS are them!\cHowever, you may be even more talented\nthan them...
Fufufufu... Watch me levitate a POKé\nBALL telekinetically!\cWrooooooooaaaar!\n... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cSometimes, I'm out of sync...
My POKéMON battling skills are out\nof sync, too!
A POKé BALL was too heavy to lift\npsychically. But this dust bunny...\cWhoooooooooooooooh!\n... ... ... ... ... ...\cNo, I'm not cheating!\nI didn't blow on it! Honestly!
When you lose to me, don't be too hard\non yourself.\cIt's not that you're weak - I'm just\ntoo strong!
You're just too strong!
I'm not going to get down on myself for\nlosing. I just need to train harder.\cPositive thinking - that's my strong\npoint!
I see it...\nI see your future...\cIf you can beat me, I will tell you\nyour future!
I surrender!
You will wage a terrifically intense\nbattle with our GYM LEADERS...\cThe result...\nYou won't hear it from me!
The roads you have traveled...\nWhat you have experienced...\cCome at me with everything you've\nlearned!
You've traveled a path of greatness!
A bright future awaits those who have\nworked diligently.\cFor those who lazed idly, there is\nonly despair at the end.\cWhat goes around comes around...
TATE: Hehehe... Were you surprised?\cLIZA: Fufufu... Were you surprised?\cTATE: That there are two GYM LEADERS?\nLIZA: That there are two GYM LEADERS?\cTATE: We're twins!\nLIZA: We're twins!\cTATE: We don't need to talk because...\nLIZA: We can each determine what...\cTATE: The other is thinking...\nLIZA: All in our minds!\cTATE: This combination of ours...\nLIZA: Can you beat it?
TATE: What?! Our combination...\nLIZA: Was shattered!\cTATE: It can't be helped. You've won...\nLIZA: So, in recognition, take this.
[PLAYER] received the MIND BADGE\nfrom LIZA and TATE.
TATE: The MIND BADGE enhances the\nSP. ATK and SP. DEF of POKéMON.\cLIZA: It also lets you use the HM move\nDIVE outside of battle.\cTATE: You should also take this, too.
TATE: That TM04 contains...\nLIZA: CALM MIND!\cTATE: It raises SP. ATK and...\nLIZA: It raises SP. DEF!\cTATE: It's a move that's perfect...\nLIZA: For PSYCHIC POKéMON!
TATE: Looks like the bond between you\nand your POKéMON is far stronger than\rthe bond that we share as twins.\cLIZA: You will become even stronger!\nWe've battled you, so we know.
TATE: Hehehe... Were you surprised?\cLIZA: That there are two GYM LEADERS?\cTATE: Oops, you have only one...\nLIZA: POKéMON that can battle.\cTATE: We can't battle that way!\cLIZA: If you want to challenge us,\nbring some more POKéMON.

MOSSDEEP CITY POKéMON GYM\cLIZA AND TATE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
Hmm!\nYour [STR_VAR_1]...
It likes [STR_VAR_1]S,\ndoesn't it?\cNo, I'm positive of it! It definitely\nlikes [STR_VAR_1]S!
It doesn't appear to like or dislike\nany [POKEBLOCK]S.
My husband can tell what kind of\n[POKEBLOCK]S a POKéMON likes at a glance.
My little sister exchanges MAIL with\nher boyfriend in FORTREE.\cI don't envy her one bit at all.
Even though I can't see my friend in\nFORTREE, my POKéMON carries MAIL back\rand forth for us.\cI'm not lonesome, even though we're\napart.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The GYM LEADERS in this town are a\nformidable duo.\cTheir combination attacks are, like,\nexcellent and wow!
Depending on the special abilities of\nPOKéMON, some moves might change\ror not work at all.
If I win a whole lot of link battles\nand show everyone how good I am,\rI might get a fan following!
REVIVE is fantastic!\cGive it to a fainted POKéMON, and the\nPOKéMON will arise.\cBut be careful, REVIVE doesn't restore\nthe used-up PP of moves.
MAX REPEL keeps all weak POKéMON away.\cOut of all the REPEL sprays, it lasts\nthe longest.
The NET and DIVE BALLS are rare POKé\nBALLS that are only made in MOSSDEEP.\cA NET BALL is effective against\nBUG-type and WATER-type POKéMON.\cA DIVE BALL works best on POKéMON at\nthe bottom of the sea.
Hey there, TRAINER!\nA SUPER ROD really is super!\cSay all you want, but this baby can\ncatch POKéMON off the seafloor!\cWhat do you think?\nYou want it, don't you?
You bet, you bet!\nAfter all, a SUPER ROD is really super!
If there's any water, try dropping in\nyour ROD and see what bites!
Hunh?\nDon't you like to fish?
Go after the seafloor POKéMON with\nyour SUPER ROD.
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN]?\cYes, this is my place. It's a little\nembarrassing how empty it is here.\cOh, here, you should take this HM.\cIt contains DIVE.\nI've already taught my POKéMON.
STEVEN: While you're using SURF, you\nshould notice dark patches of water.\cUse DIVE if you come to deep water\nlike it. You'll drop to the seafloor.\cWhen you want to come back up, use\nDIVE again.\cIn some places, it won't be possible\nfor you to surface, though.
STEVEN: Apparently, there's an\nunderwater cavern between\rMOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\cYou know, the one that CAPT. STERN\nfound in his submarine.\cAn underwater cavern...\cThere might be some rare stones down\nthere... I should go for a DIVE...
[PLAYER] checked the POKé BALL.\cIt contained the POKéMON\nBELDUM.\cTake the POKé BALL?
[PLAYER] obtained a BELDUM.
There is no space for another POKéMON.
[PLAYER] left the POKé BALL where\nit was.
It's a letter.\c... ... ... ... ... ...\cTo [PLAYER][KUN]...\cI've decided to do a little soul-\nsearching and train on the road.\cI don't plan to return home for some\ntime.\cI have a favor to ask of you.\cI want you to take the POKé BALL on\nthe desk.\cInside it is a BELDUM, my favorite\nPOKéMON.\cI'm counting on you.\cMay our paths cross some day.\cSTEVEN STONE

It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by STEVEN.
My little brother says he likes to go\nfind people's SECRET BASES.
My little brother says he likes to\nvisit people's SECRET BASES and have\rPOKéMON battles.
Was it you who made a SECRET BASE in\n[STR_VAR_1]?
You should make a SECRET BASE\nsomewhere. I'll go find it!
DELCATTY: Miyaan?
The rocket's launch is imminent!
The rocket launched safely!\nThat's successful launch no. [STR_VAR_1]!
A rocket launch demands perfection.\nNot even a 1% margin of error is allowed.\cEven if it's 99% okay, the whole thing\nis useless if 1% happens to be no good.\cDespite that, we never stop trying.\nWhy? It's a dream that never ends.
I was taking a stroll down the beach\nwhen I found this.\cIt's not anything I need, so you can\nhave it.
The HOENN region has been famous for \nits meteor showers for a long time.
Some people claim that POKéMON came\nfrom space. Could it be true?
A giant chunk of metal bursts through\nthe skies and flies into space...\cIt boggles my mind!
MOSSDEEP has mainly sunny weather,\nand its winds are stable.\cIt's an ideal location for launching\nrockets.
If only I was a little younger, I would\nhave liked being an astronaut...\cNo... It's not too late!\nI can and will try!
I wish ordinary people could go into\nspace one day...
When I was young, I traveled the world\nas a POKéMON TRAINER.\cNow that I've become an old buzzard,\nmy only amusement is watching young\rTRAINERS battle.
The door appears to be locked.
A TRAINER named [STR_VAR_1] is\nvisiting my home.\cWould you like to challenge\n[STR_VAR_1]?
You won't battle? I'm disappointed\nthat I can't see you battle...
Oh, good, good!\cBut my house isn't all that sturdy.\cCould I ask you to keep it down to\na 3-on-3 match?
Before you two battle, you should\nsave your progress.
I hope to see a good match!
[STR_VAR_1]
The match ended up a draw.
So, it became a standoff.\cIt was a brilliant match in which\nneither side conceded a step!
[STR_VAR_1]
That was superlative!\cWhy, it was like seeing myself in my\nyouth again!
[STR_VAR_1]
Ah, too bad for you!\cBut it was a good match.\nI hope you can win next time.
Yo! How's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER WALLACE is\na master of WATER-type POKéMON.\cAnd, to get to WALLACE, an icy floor\nwill hamper your progress...\cListen, I'm sorry, but that's all the\nadvice that I have for you.\cThe rest of the way, you have to\ngo for it yourself!
Yow! You've beaten even WALLACE, who\nwas supposedly the best in all HOENN!\cOkay! Check out your TRAINER's CARD.\cIf you've gotten all the BADGES, you're\nset for the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge!
I'll show you the sublime techniques\nI learned from our LEADER WALLACE!
Please forgive me, WALLACE...
Watch what happens if you crack all\nthe floor tiles.
You came all the way here, but you won't\nget to see WALLACE.\cNot if you lose to me, you won't!
You're strong!\nI was fooled by your cute looks!
You might be good enough to avoid\nbeing wiped out in one hit by WALLACE.
The sight of WALLACE conducting a\nbattle...\cThe very beauty of it compelled me to\nbecome a TRAINER.
You battled with more beauty than\nI could muster...
The grace you bring to battle is\nfabulous.\cOh... I'm so fortunate to have found\nPOKéMON.
I should teach you how harsh battles\ncan be.
Oh.\nYou're strong.
I'll tell you something good.\cIf you want to reach WALLACE, you\nneed to walk on each floor tile once.
The POKéMON GYM of the highest level\nin the HOENN region...\cThat's the SOOTOPOLIS GYM.
What a high level you are!
Rather than being satisfied by being\nin a strong GYM, I imagine training in\rother places will make you stronger.\rBut above all, it looks more fun.
I train my POKéMON together with\nWALLACE.\cDon't think I'm a pushover.
I was bowled right over...
I think you have potential.\nWhy don't you stay and train with us?
A graceful glide across the ice while\ncrossing no lines...\cA TRAINER putting on that performance\nwould be elegantly beautiful!
Well, excuse me?!
This is really obvious, but how strong\nyou are as a TRAINER has nothing to do\rwith how young or old you are.
When I'm with my POKéMON, the time\nflies by before you can say, “Oops!”
Oops!
I wish I can forget about lost causes\nbefore I can manage an “Oops!”
Allow me to formally introduce\nmyself.\cI am WALLACE.\nThe GYM LEADER of SOOTOPOLIS.\cThere's something about you...\nA difference in your demeanor.\cI think I sense that in you.\cWhat happened inside the CAVE OF\nORIGIN, and what you did, I will likely\rlearn through our upcoming battle.\cNow, show me. Show me the power you\nwield with your POKéMON.\cAnd I, in turn, shall present you with\na performance of illusions in water\rby me and my POKéMON!
Bravo.\cI realize now your authenticity and\nmagnificence as a POKéMON TRAINER.\cI find much joy in having met you and\nyour POKéMON.\cYou have proven yourself worthy of\nthe RAIN BADGE. Accept it.
[PLAYER] received the RAIN BADGE\nfrom WALLACE.
Having that BADGE assures you the\nfull obedience of all your POKéMON to\revery command you make.\cThe BADGE also allows the use of the\nHM move WATERFALL to scale walls\rof cascading water.\cAnd, so that you never forget the\nbattle we shared, take this...
The TM I handed you contains\nWATER PULSE.\cIn use, it will occasionally confuse\nthe target with ultrasonic waves.
TRAINERS who have gathered all the\nGYM BADGES of HOENN should make way\rfor the ultimate destination.\cThe POKéMON LEAGUE.\cTravel to the easternmost reaches\nof HOENN, to the island EVER GRANDE.\rThe POKéMON LEAGUE is there.
There remains but one BADGE to\nobtain in HOENN.\cIf you wish to challenge the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you must obtain the last\rBADGE from the GYM in FORTREE.
SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM
SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM\cWALLACE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
WALLACE, this town's GYM LEADER, is a\npowerful TRAINER.\cHe's rumored to be the best in the\nwhole HOENN region.\cBut the ELITE FOUR...\cThey're said to be even stronger than\nWALLACE. How strong could they be?
Everyone in town has taken refuge\nand won't come out of their homes.\cThis weather..\nCould it be the prelude to something?
Whenever, wherever, and whatever\nhappens, I will always be friends with\rPOKéMON.\cBecause it's fun to be with POKéMON!
I don't know why...\nBut... I'm really scared...
PP UP is great!\cIt raises the POWER POINTS, the PP,\nof a POKéMON move.
What... What is happening?
Do you know FULL RESTORE?\cFull restoration of HP!\nEradication of all status problems!\cIt's truly an item of your dreams!
This weather...\nDid something awaken?
For thirty years I've remained in\nSOOTOPOLIS honing my skills.\cI developed a shattering TM.\nI bequeath it to you!
TM31 contains BRICK BREAK! It's a move\nso horrible that I can't describe it.
KECLEON: Puu puhyaah.
MT. PYRE...\cAt its peak are two orbs placed side\nby side. Did you know?
Yes, two orbs side by side...\cThe sight of them together...\nIt is somehow soothing...
Is that so?\nPerhaps you ought to visit and see...
You're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\cSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER WALLACE has\nmany fans.\rDo you have any?
Oh, then you must be pretty strong.
Oh, dear...\nThat's a little lonesome.\cTry working a little harder to get a\nfan following.
Dedicated fans come over from even\nKANTO and JOHTO.\cIt was really wild when I went to the\nTRAINER FAN CLUB in LILYCOVE.
Listen up, and I'll tell you something\ngood.\cThere's supposed to be an ancient\nruin in the sea around here.\cThere could be treasures just waiting\nto be discovered down there.
Ancient treasures...\cIt would be nice if they existed, but\neven if they didn't, it would be so\rbeautiful to take an underwater\rstroll with my POKéMON.
AZUMARILL: Marurii.
There appears to be some connection\nbetween SOOTOPOLIS and MT. PYRE.\cMy friends and I did some research on\nit at the lab where I used to work.
My big brother used to study the sea.
Hello! You're our first guest in a\ngood while.\cYou've brightened up my day, so I'll\ngive you a big WAILMER DOLL.
Take good care of it!
Oh, you want it, but not right now?\nOkay, then I'll hold it for you.
Are you sure?\nYou don't want this DOLL?
I love plush DOLLS!
An underwater volcano erupted and\nforced itself up from the depths.\cIts crater emerged from the sea and\nbecame filled with rainwater.\cThat's how SOOTOPOLIS CITY came into\nbeing.
The cave that links SOOTOPOLIS and\nthe outside world...\cIt seems as if the cave was made to\nkeep something from getting out.\cOr am I just imagining things?
Do you know the POKéMON SHROOMISH?\nIt's hardly ever seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\cAnyway, I love big SHROOMISH.\nThe bigger the better.\cBut my younger brother, he says that\nBARBOACH is bigger.\cThat's silly. SHROOMISH has to be\nbigger than that!\cHuh? Do you have a SHROOMISH with you?\nP-p-please, show me!
[STR_VAR_2] inches!\nOh, my gosh, this is a big one!\cIt might even beat the big BARBOACH\nmy younger brother saw!\cThanks for showing me.\nThis is my thanks!
[PLAYER] received a POTION.
Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.
[STR_VAR_2] inches, is it?\cHmm... I've seen a bigger SHROOMISH\nthan this one.
Oh, now this is quite something...\nBut it's not a SHROOMISH!
You don't have a big SHROOMISH?\nThat's too bad...\cIf you get a big SHROOMISH, please\ncome show me.
The biggest SHROOMISH in history!\n[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]-inch giant!\cA SHROOMISH bigger than a BARBOACH\nalways wanted!
Do you know the POKéMON BARBOACH?\nIt's rarely seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\cI love, I mean love, big BARBOACH!\cMy big brother says that SHROOMISH is\nbigger.\cBut that's wrong! Everyone knows that\nBARBOACH is a lot bigger.\cHunh? Do you have a BARBOACH?\nP-p-please show me!
[STR_VAR_2] inches!\nWow, that is big!\cIt might be even bigger than the huge\nSHROOMISH my big brother saw.\cThanks for showing me!\nThis is my thanks!
Whoops, looks like your BAG is full.
[STR_VAR_2] inches?\cHmm... I've seen a bigger BARBOACH\nthan this one here.
Well, isn't this something!\nBut it's no BARBOACH!
Don't you have a big BARBOACH?\nHow disappointing...\cIf you get a big BARBOACH, please\ncome show me!
The biggest BARBOACH in history!\n[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]-inch colossus!\cA BARBOACH bigger than a SHROOMISH\nalways wanted!
Welcome, challenger!\nI'm SIDNEY of the ELITE FOUR.\cI like that look you're giving me.\nI guess you'll give me a good match.\rThat's good! Looking real good!\cAll right! You and me, let's enjoy a\nbattle that can only be staged here\rin the POKéMON LEAGUE!
Well, how do you like that? I lost!\nEh, it was fun, so it doesn't matter.
Well, listen to what this loser has\nto say.\cYou've got what it takes to go far.\nNow, go on to the next room and enjoy\ryour next battle!
Ahahaha!\cI'm PHOEBE of the ELITE FOUR.\nI did my training on MT. PYRE.\cWhile I trained, I gained the ability\nto commune with GHOST-type POKéMON.\cYes, the bond I developed with POKéMON\nis extremely tight.\cSo, come on, just try and see if you can\neven inflict damage on my POKéMON!
Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.
There's a definite bond between you\nand your POKéMON, too.\cI didn't recognize it, so it's only\nnatural that I lost.\cYup, I'd like to see how far your bond\nwill carry you.\cGo ahead, move on to the next room.
Welcome, my name is GLACIA of the\nELITE FOUR.\cI've traveled from afar to HOENN so\nthat I may hone my ice skills.\cBut all I have seen are challenges by\nweak TRAINERS and their POKéMON.\cWhat about you?\cIt would please me to no end if I could\ngo all out against you!
You and your POKéMON...\nHow hot your spirits burn!\cThe all-consuming heat overwhelms.\cIt's no surprise that my icy skills\nfailed to harm you.
Advance to the next room.\cAnd there, confirm the truly fearsome\nside of the POKéMON LEAGUE.
I am the last of the POKéMON LEAGUE\nELITE FOUR, DRAKE the DRAGON master!\cIn their natural state, POKéMON are\nwild living things. They are free.\cAt times, they hinder us.\nAt times, they help us.\cFor us to battle with POKéMON as\npartners, do you know what it takes?\cDo you know what is needed?\cIf you don't, then you will never\nprevail over me!
Superb, it should be said.
You deserve every credit for coming\nthis far as a TRAINER of POKéMON.\cYou do seem to know what is needed.\cYes, what a TRAINER needs is a\nvirtuous heart.\cPOKéMON touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and learn good from wrong.\cThey touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and grow strong.\cGo! Go onwards!\nThe CHAMPION is waiting!
STEVEN: Welcome, [PLAYER][KUN].\cI was looking forward to seeing you\nhere one day.\cYou... What did you see on your\njourney with POKéMON?\cWhat did you feel, meeting so many\nother TRAINERS like you?\cWhat has awoken in you?\nI want you to hit me with it all!\cNow, bring it!
I, the CHAMPION, fall in defeat...\cKudos to you, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou are a truly noble POKéMON\nTRAINER!
STEVEN: Congratulations!\cThe feelings you have for your\nPOKéMON...\cAnd the POKéMON that responded to\nthose feelings with all their might...\cThey came together as one, and created\nan even greater power.\cAnd thus, you were able to grasp\nvictory today!\cYou are rightfully the HOENN region's\nnew...
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHere's some advice before you challenge\nthe CHAMPION...
MAY: Huh? What, what, what?\c[PLAYER][KUN]...\nCould it be that...\rIt's already over?
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]!\cHow would you like some advice before\nyou challenge the CHAMPION?...
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]...\cAre you trying to tell me...\nYou've beaten the CHAMPION?
PROF. BIRCH: See?\nWhat did I tell you, [RIVAL]?\cDidn't I tell you that you don't need\nto worry about [PLAYER][KUN]?\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n[PLAYER][KUN], you've finally done it.\cWhen I heard that you defeated your\nown father at the PETALBURG GYM,\rI thought perhaps you had a chance...\cBut to think you've actually become\nthe CHAMPION!\cAh, yes!\cWhat became of your POKéDEX?\nHere, let me see.
PROF. BIRCH: Anyways,\ncongratulations!\cNow, go proudly into the final room!
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN]...\cNo, the new CHAMPION!\cCome with me.
STEVEN: I'm sorry, but...\cFrom here on, only those TRAINERS who\nhave become CHAMPIONS may enter.\cYou'll have to wait outside with the\nPROFESSOR.
MAY: Groan...\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cI'm just joking! That's okay!\nThat's the rule!\c[PLAYER][KUN]!\nHonestly, congratulations!
BRENDAN: ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cIt can't be helped if that's the rule.\c[PLAYER], way to go!\nCongratulations!
Beyond this point, only those TRAINERS\nwho have collected all the GYM BADGES\rare permitted to enter.\cTRAINER, let us confirm that you have\nall the GYM BADGES.
You haven't obtained all the BADGES.\cIf you're bound for the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you must return with them.
TRAINER! Believe in yourself and your\nPOKéMON, and go forth!
STEVEN: This room...\cThis is where we keep records of\nPOKéMON that prevailed through\rharsh battles.\cIt is here that the LEAGUE CHAMPIONS\nare honored.
STEVEN: Come on, let's record your\nname as a TRAINER who triumphed over\rthe POKéMON LEAGUE, and the names of\rthe partners who battled with you.
The POKéMON LEAGUE is only a short\ndistance after the VICTORY ROAD.\cIf you've come this far, what choice\ndo you have but to keep going?
The long and harrowing VICTORY ROAD...\cIt's like reliving the path one has\ntraveled in life...\cBelieve in your POKéMON and give it\nyour very best!
MR. BRINEY: Hold on, lass!\nWait up, PEEKO!
Hm? You're [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou saved my darling PEEKO!\rWe owe so much to you!\cWhat's that?\nYou want to sail with me?\cHmhm...\cYou have a LETTER bound for DEWFORD\nand a package for SLATEPORT, then?\cQuite the busy life you must lead!\cBut, certainly, what you're asking is\nno problem at all.\cYou've come to the right man!\nWe'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: DEWFORD, here we come!\cAnchors aweigh!\nPEEKO, we're setting sail, my darling!
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?\nYour deliveries can wait?\cYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail!
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nI know exactly what you want to say!\cYou're to deliver a LETTER to DEWFORD\nand a package to SLATEPORT.\cWhat you need me to do is no problem\nat all - I'm the man for the job!\cFirst, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nI know exactly what you want to say!\cYou're to deliver a package to\nCAPT. STERN in SLATEPORT.\cWhat you need me to do is no problem\nat all - I'm the man for the job!\cFirst, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nFor you, I'll go out to sea anytime!\cNow, my friend, where are we bound?
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?\nWell, PEEKO owes her life to you.\cYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail!
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nWe've made land in PETALBURG!\cYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail!
PEEKO: Pii pihyoroo!
You're the first TRAINER I've seen who\ndeploys POKéMON so masterfully.\cBut, I should tell you - my son is\nstronger than you.\cHe even took the POKéMON LEAGUE\nchallenge, I'll have you know.
We use this MACHO BRACE to more\neffectively strengthen our POKéMON\rin training.\cSince you've beaten our entire family,\nI don't know if you need it, but we\rwould like you to have our MACHO BRACE.
When it comes to POKéMON battles,\nwe tend to be pretty passionate.
Mommy is stronger than Daddy.\cI'm stronger than Mommy.\cAnd Grandma's stronger than me!\cBut my big brother is even stronger\nthan Grandma.
There's no question that you're strong.\cBut if you were to battle my grandson,\nyou'd end up crying in frustration.\cHe's much stronger than any TRAINER\nour family knows.\cHe must be challenging the POKéMON\nLEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\cKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!
My grandson must be challenging the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\cKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!
Oh, dear, dear.\nAren't your POKéMON exhausted?\cIf you'd like, rest up here.\nThat's a fine idea! You should do that.
That's right.\nTake your time and rest up!
Oh, dear, dear.\nAre your POKéMON still tired?\cYou should take another rest here.\nThat's a fine idea. You should do that.
Is that so?\nYou don't need to be shy about it.
The CABLE CAR is ready to go up.\nWould you like to be on it?
Please step this way.
Please ride with us another time.

My big brother's the FOSSIL MANIAC...\nHe's a nice guy who loves fossils...\cHe loves digging holes, too...\nHe dug this hole by himself...\cYou can have this, so you can DIG\nholes just like my big brother...
If you make a POKéMON DIG inside a\ncave, you're returned to the entrance...
Rocks in peculiar shapes fill the\ndisplay case
THE COMPOSITION OF STRATA...\nHOW RAIN SHAPES THE LAND...\rSTONES, SOIL, AND ROCK...\cIt's crammed with books.
I'm the FOSSIL MANIAC...\nI'm a nice guy who loves fossils...\cDo you want a fossil?\cBut the fossils around these parts all\nbelong to me... None for you...\cIf you can't go without a fossil, go to\nthe desert on ROUTE 111...\cFrom what I've heard, fossils that were\nburied in the sand sometimes rise to\rthe surface from sandstorms...
You found a FOSSIL, didn't you?\nThat's so nice... It's so dreamy...\cWhat are you going to do with that\nFOSSIL?\cFrom what I've heard, DEVON is doing\nresearch on reviving POKéMON from\rFOSSILS...\cI love my FOSSILS, so I would never\ndo anything like that...
FOSSILS are so... Wonderful...\nIt's so dreamy...
LANETTE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI'm sorry everything is so cluttered...\nWhen I get engrossed in research,\rthings end up this way...\cThis is embarrassing... Please keep\nthis a secret in exchange for this.
May I offer advice about my POKéMON\nStorage System?\cYou should organize your BOXES so you\ncan tell which POKéMON are in them.
It's LANETTE's research notes.\nThere's information about BOXES.\cDesign BOXES to hold 30 POKéMON each.\cEach TRAINER should be able to store\n420 POKéMON on the PC system.\cKeep reading?
A marking system should be added to\nmake POKéMON easier to organize.\cThe name and wallpaper design of each\nBOX will be made changeable to please\rthe stored POKéMON.\cKeep reading?
When storing a POKéMON, it should be\nsent to the BOX inspected last.\cIf that BOX is full, the received\nPOKéMON is stored in the next BOX.\cIn other words, when a BOX is examined,\nit is automatically selected as the BOX\rto which POKéMON are sent.
[PLAYER] closed the notebook.
There's an e-mail from someone on\nthe PC.\c“... ... ... ... ... ... ...\c“Your Storage System offers more\nconvenience than mine.\c“It has a lot of user-friendly features\nthat make it fun and useful, too.\c“It makes me proud that I played\na part in its development.\c“Here's hoping that you'll continue\nresearch in Storage Systems.\c“From BILL\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...”
That RUSTURF TUNNEL there...\cAt first, we had a huge work crew boring\nthrough rock with the latest machinery.\rBut, we had to stop.\cIt turns out that we would have had\na negative effect on wild POKéMON in\rthe area.\cSo, we've got nothing to do but loll\naround here doing nothing.
There's a man digging his way to\nVERDANTURF all by his lonesome.\rHe's desperate to get through.\cHe says that if he digs little by little\nwithout using machines, he won't\rdisturb POKéMON, and he'll avoid harming\rthe natural environment.
To get to VERDANTURF without using\nthis TUNNEL, you'd have to cross the\rsea to DEWFORD, sail on to SLATEPORT,\rthen travel through MAUVILLE.
Did you hear? The TUNNEL to VERDANTURF\nhas gone through!\cSometimes, if you hope strongly enough,\ndreams do come true.
Hehehe!\cWith this METEORITE, MT. CHIMNEY\nwill...
Heh?\cI don't know who you are, but if you get\nin the way of TEAM [EVIL_TEAM], don't\rexpect any mercy!
Hold it right there, TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]!\cWe, TEAM [GOOD_TEAM], won't allow you to\nget away with your misdeeds!
Hehehe!\nEven TEAM [GOOD_TEAM] joins us!\cBut it's too much trouble to deal with\nyou all...\cHeh, it doesn't matter!\cWe've got the METEORITE, so off to\nMT. CHIMNEY we go!\cHehehe! Be seeing you, you TEAM\n[GOOD_TEAM] dingbats!
And you are?\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cFine, so you are [PLAYER][KUN].\cI am MAXIE. As the head of TEAM MAGMA,\nI have dedicated myself to thwarting\rthe dangerous plans of TEAM AQUA.\cWhy? Because TEAM AQUA is a grave\nthreat to us all.\cThey have committed many destructive\nacts in their bid to enlarge the sea.\cWe, TEAM MAGMA, love dry land above\nall! TEAM AQUA is our sworn enemy!
Who might you be?\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cAh, so you are [PLAYER][KUN].\cI am ARCHIE. As the head of TEAM AQUA,\nI have dedicated myself to thwarting\rthe dangerous plans of TEAM MAGMA.\cWhy? Because TEAM MAGMA is a grave\nthreat to us all.\cThey have committed many destructive\nacts in their bid to expand the land.\cWe, TEAM AQUA, love the sea above\nall! TEAM MAGMA is our sworn enemy!
[GOOD_LEADER], we should give chase to\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]...
[GOOD_LEADER]: Yes, yes, we must!\nWe've got to hurry.\cThere's no telling what TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]\nwill do at MT. CHIMNEY!
[GOOD_LEADER]: [PLAYER][KUN], you should keep\nan eye out for TEAM [EVIL_TEAM], too.\cFarewell!
I... I'm COZMO...\nI'm a PROFESSOR...\cI usually study METEORITES in\nFALLARBOR TOWN...\cThen some people from TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]\nmade me guide them to METEOR FALLS...\cThey promised me that they would\nexcavate METEORITES for me...\cBut, I...\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM] tricked me...\cOh... That METEORITE...\nIt will never be mine now...\cBut that TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]...\cWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
PROF. COZMO: That TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]...\cWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
This is where we DRAGON users do our\ntraining.\cThe CHAMPION even visits.\nNow do you see how special it is here?
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!
The road ahead remains long and harsh.\cWhen will my POKéMON and I become the\nbest?
Since we met, we have trained hard\nwith our sights on number one.\cHelp us see how much stronger we've\nbecome!
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!
You've obviously kept up your\nPOKéMON training.\cSo long as you remain strong, I, too,\ncan become stronger!
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\rWe've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.\nWe've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cCome to think of it, I've yet to beat\nmy dear wife in a battle.
JOHN: Well, well, what a young TRAINER!\cWill you battle with us? If so, you'll\nhave to return with more POKéMON.
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cThe bond we share as a couple could\nnever be broken.
JAY: Oh, dear.\nWe've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage...\cIf we ever argued, we always settled\nit with a POKéMON battle...
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young\nTRAINER?\cIf you'd care to battle with us, you'll\nhave to come back with more POKéMON.
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\rWe've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.\nWe've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: Married for fifty years...\cOn reflection, the dear wife and I,\nwe battled day in and day out...
JOHN: Well, well, what a young\nTRAINER!\cWill you battle with us? If so, you'll\nhave to return with more POKéMON.
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cWe've supported each other all that\ntime. We've made ourselves strong.
JAY: Oh, dear.\nWe've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage...\nMany things have happened.\cI hope that we will continue to make\nhappy memories together.
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young\nTRAINER?\cIf you'd care to battle with us, you'll\nhave to come back with more POKéMON.
What, are you coming?\nCome and get some, then!
PEEKO: Pii pihyoh!
Grah, keelhaul it all!\cThat hostage POKéMON turned out to\nbe worthless!\cAnd to think I made a getaway...\nIn this tunnel to nowhere!\cHey! You!\nSo you want to battle me?
Urrrggh! My career in crime comes to\na dead end!
This is plain not right...\cThe BOSS told me this would be a\nslick-and-easy job to pull.\cAll I had to do was steal some package\nfrom DEVON.\cTch!\nYou want it back that badly, take it!
PEEKO! Am I glad to see you're safe!
PEEKO owes her life to you!\cThey call me MR. BRINEY.\nAnd, you are?\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cAh, so you are [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI sincerely thank you!\cNow, if there's anything that troubles\nyou, don't hesitate to tell me!\cYou can usually find me in my cottage\nby the sea near PETALBURG WOODS.\cCome, PEEKO, we should make our way\nhome.\cPEEKO: Pihyoh!
... ...\cWhy can't they keep digging?\nIs the bedrock too hard?\cMy beloved awaits me in VERDANTURF\nTOWN just beyond here...\cIf RUSTBORO and VERDANTURF were\njoined by this tunnel, I could visit\rher every day...\cBut this...\nWhat am I to do?
To get from RUSTBORO to VERDANTURF,\nyou need to go to DEWFORD, then pass\rthrough SLATEPORT and MAUVILLE...
Wow! You shattered that boulder\nblocking the way.\cTo show you how much I appreciate it,\nI'd like you to have this HM.
That HM contains STRENGTH.\cIf a muscular POKéMON were to learn\nthat, it would be able to move even\rlarge boulders.
WANDA!\nNow I can see you anytime!\cWANDA: That's...wonderful.\cPlease, take some rest at my home.
On the other side of this rock...\nMy boyfriend is there.\cHe... He's not just digging the tunnel\nto come see me.\cHe works his hands raw and rough\nfor the benefit of everyone.
What do you call a wild man up in the\nmountains? A mountain man, right?\cSo why don't they call a POKéMON in the\nmountains a mountain POKéMON?
My POKéMON...\nRan out of power...
They halted development here to\nprotect POKéMON, right?\rThere's a feel-good story!
Hey, you.\nIt gets awfully dark ahead.\rIt'll be tough trying to explore.\cThat guy who came by earlier...\nSTEVEN, I think it was.\cHe knew how to use FLASH, so he ought\nto be all right, but...\cWell, for us HIKERS, helping out those\nthat we meet is our motto.\cHere you go, I'll pass this on to you.
Teach that hidden move FLASH to a\nPOKéMON and use it.\cIt lights up even the inky darkness\nof caves.\cBut, to use it, you need the GYM BADGE\nfrom DEWFORD's POKéMON GYM.
That device you have there...\nIt's a POKéNAV.\cWhen TRAINERS that have POKéNAVS\nbattle, it keeps a record of how\rthings went, I think.\cOh, pardon me.\nMy name is STEVEN.\cI'm interested in rare stones, so\nI travel here and there.\cOh?\nA LETTER for me?
STEVEN: Okay, thank you.\cYou went through all this trouble to\ndeliver that. I need to thank you.\cLet me see...\nI'll give you this TM.\cIt contains my favorite move,\nSTEEL WING.
STEVEN: Your POKéMON appear quite\ncapable.\cIf you keep training, you could even\nbecome the CHAMPION of the POKéMON\rLEAGUE one day. That's what I think.\cNow, I've got to hurry along.
Oh, your BAG is full...\nThat's too bad, then.
Hmmm...\nNot a one to be found...
Hello, have you seen any POKéMON\ncalled SHROOMISH around here?\cI really love that POKéMON.
I was going to ambush you, but you\nhad to dawdle in PETALBURG WOODS\rforever, didn't you?\cI got sick of waiting, so here I am!
You! DEVON RESEARCHER!\cHand over those papers!
Aiyeeeh!\cYou're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\nYou've got to help me, please!
Hunh? What do you think you're doing?\nWhat, you're going to protect him?\cNo one who crosses TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]\ngets any mercy, not even a kid!\cCome on and battle me!
You're kidding me! You're tough!
Grrr... You've got some nerve\nmeddling with TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]!\rCome on and battle me again!\cI wish I could say that, but I'm out of\nPOKéMON...\cAnd, hey, we of TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] are also\nafter something in RUSTBORO.\cI'll let you go today!
Whew...\nThat was awfully close!\cThanks to you, he didn't rob me of\nthese important papers.\cI know, I'll give you a GREAT BALL as\nmy thanks!
Didn't that TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] thug say\nthey were after something in\rRUSTBORO, too?
Uh-oh! It's a crisis!\nI can't be wasting time!
You're loaded with items.\nI can't give you this GREAT BALL.
I caught a whole bunch of POKéMON!\cGo, go, go!\nMy BUG POKéMON team!
I have all these POKéMON, but I\ncouldn't win...
I caught a bunch of POKéMON.\nNow I'm out of POKé BALLS.
If you take BUG POKéMON to school,\nyou get to be instantly popular!
I can't be popular if I lose.
If you have a big BUG POKéMON, people\nrespect you for it.
My BUG POKéMON have grown.\nI'll be popular again.
I can't be popular if I lose.
You get to be popular if you have\nstrong POKéMON, right?\rSo, I've been training hard.
Yo, there!\nYour POKéMON doing okay?\cIf your POKéMON are weak and you want\nto avoid battles, you should stay out\rof tall grass.
Sometimes, there are things on the\nground even if you can't see them.\cThat's why I always check where I'm\nwalking.
Oh, neat!\nThat's the BADGE from RUSTBORO GYM!\cYou must be a TRAINER.\nYou should try using this item.
It's a MIRACLE SEED.\nIf a POKéMON holds that item, its\rGRASS-type moves become stronger.\cBesides MIRACLE SEED, I think there are\nother convenient items for POKéMON\rto hold.
TRAINER TIPS\cAny POKéMON that appears even once\nin a battle is awarded EXP Points.\cTo raise a weak POKéMON, put it at the\ntop of the team list.\cAs soon as a battle starts, switch it\nout. It will earn EXP Points without\rbeing exposed to any harm.
TRAINER TIPS\cIn addition to Hit Points (HP), POKéMON\nhave Power Points (PP) that are used to\rmake moves during battle.\cIf a POKéMON runs out of PP, it must be\ntaken to a POKéMON CENTER.
LAVA COOKIES are MT. CHIMNEY's local\nspecialty.\cTry one. It's just $200.
Thank you, dear!
Oh, dear. You can't buy a thing if\nyou've not got the money.
Oh, fine then.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious\nmachine...\cThe machine seems to be storing\nenergy in the METEORITE.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious\nmachine...\cDo you want to remove the METEORITE?
[PLAYER] removed the METEORITE from\nthe mysterious machine.
[PLAYER] left the METEORITE where\nit was.
This mysterious machine...\nIt makes no response whatsoever.
[DOWN_ARROW] JAGGED PATH\nLAVARIDGE TOWN AHEAD
I've been to the hot springs and\nrefreshed my tired bones.\rRight now I'm feeling strong!
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!
Well, well, I've lost. I can't call\nmyself an EXPERT now, can I?
If you can mesh your heart with those\nof your POKéMON, why, you should be\rable to achieve great things.
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!
Perhaps your heart has become one\nwith the hearts of your POKéMON.
I've got the fire in me, baby.\nI can't stand it! I have to battle!
Ooh, that was a scorching-hot match!
The heat of MT. CHIMNEY lights my\nfire, baby!
I've finally made it to MT. CHIMNEY.\nI want to make my POKéMON battle!
The way you battle...\nIt's like a MT. CHIMNEY eruption!
Like I said, I've finally made it to\nMT. CHIMNEY. It would be a shame if\rI only do a little sightseeing...\cI want to get in some battles and buy\nCOOKIES as souvenirs.
Since I bathed in the hot springs,\nI've been feeling great!\rI'm sure I'm going to win!
Yowch!\nI'm getting a chill out of the water.
I'll have to take another dip in the\nhot springs. Want to join me?\cJust joking!
MT. CHIMNEY's JAGGED PASS...\cNow this is what I've always wanted\nin a mountain.\cThis jagged bumpiness...\nIt rocks my soul!
Losing left me bitter!
Yes, I did lose at POKéMON...\cBut, when it comes to the love of\nthe mountains, I have you beat!
This place isn't your casual hike.\nIt's not suited for a picnic.
Ohhh, no!\nThe ground is too bumpy...
Did you know?\cSome people cleverly ride their\nbicycles up this horribly bumpy pass.
Picnics are fun wherever you go.\nJust like POKéMON!
I only lost because the ground is\ntoo bumpy!
I'll forget about losing and just\nenjoy this bumpy hike.
JAGGED PASS is hard to walk on.\nIt's a good place for training.
It was all over while we were still\ntrying to find a good footing...
If I had an ACRO BIKE, I'd be able to\njump ledges.
I got used to this bumpiness.\nI sing while I climb now.
It's still not easy to battle on this\nbumpy ground...
I should get an ACRO BIKE from RYDEL\nin MAUVILLE CITY...
All sorts of beings wander the slopes\nof MT. PYRE...\cThere is no telling what may happen.\nTake this. It's for your own good.
Have a POKéMON hold that\nCLEANSE TAG.\cIt will help ward off wild POKéMON.
Did you come to pay your respect\nto the spirits of departed POKéMON?\cYou must care for your POKéMON a lot.
This is the final resting place of my\nZIGZAGOON. I cherished it...
LUKE: We're here on a dare.\cHeheh, if I show her how cool I am,\nshe'll fall for me. I know it!\cI know! I'll cream you and show her\nhow cool I am!
LUKE: Whoopsie!
LUKE: Well, we lost but that's okay!\nI'm right here by your side.\rWe'll make it through this dare!
LUKE: If you want to take me on, bring\nsome more POKéMON.\cIf you don't, I won't be able to show\noff how cool I am to my girl!
DEZ: I came here on a dare with my\nboyfriend.\cIt's really scary, but I'm with my\nboyfriend. It's okay.\cI know! I'll get my boyfriend to look\ncool by beating you!
DEZ: Waaaah! I'm scared!
DEZ: We're lovey-dovey, so we don't\ncare if we lose!
DEZ: If you want to challenge us, you\nshould bring at least two POKéMON.\cMy boyfriend's strong.\nJust one POKéMON won't do at all.
Memories of my darling SKITTY...\nMy eyes overflow thinking about it.
Ooch, ouch... There are holes in the\nground here and there.\cI didn't notice and took a tumble from\nthe floor above.
Hey! Are you searching for POKéMON?\nYou came along after me! You're rude!
Ayieeeeh!\nI'm sorry, forgive me, please!
People don't come here often, so\nI thought there'd be rare POKéMON.
The rich atmosphere of the mountain\nhas elevated my psychic power!\cA mere child like you...\nYou dream of winning?
I drown in self-pity...
My psychic powers have surely\ngrown several times, but...
Ahahahaha!\cThis is no place for children, least\nof all you!
I lost that cleanly...
This means my training is still not\nenough...\cI've got to keep working toward the\nsummit...\cGo, me!
Teacher...\nPlease watch over my progress!
Teacher...\nPlease forgive me!
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests\nhere, will never find true peace...
I love all things horrifying...\nIt's like a disease...\cWhen I'm here...\nI shiver with fear...
Losing, I dislike...
I want to see dreadful things...\nI can't leave...\cStay...\nWon't you stay with me?
When I'm here...\nA curious power flows into me...
The power is ebbing away...
Perhaps the power is from the spirits\nof POKéMON in fitful sleep here...
Behind you...\nWhat is it...
Something faded away...
The POKéMON at rest here...\nSometimes, they play...
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]?\cOur BOSS isn't here! He's gone off to\nsnatch something important!\c... ...\nWhere did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]?\cOur BOSS isn't here!\nHe's gone off to jack a submarine!\c... ...\nWhere did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]?\cOur BOSS isn't here! He's on his way to\nMT. PYRE on ROUTE 122!\c... ...\nWhy did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]?\cOur BOSS isn't here!\nHe's on his way to SLATEPORT CITY!\c... ...\nWhy did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
Ayiyiyi!\nSuspicious character spotted!
Grrrrr...\nI lost it!
I took the loss for the TEAM, but\nI did my job...
If you want to know the secret about\nour HIDEOUT, you have me to beat!
I can't win at all...
Our HIDEOUT's secret?\cWell, let's just say...\nThere's a submarine at the far end!\cBut, by now...\nKekekeke...
Fuel supply loaded A-OK!\nIn-cruise snacks loaded A-OK!\cNothing left to do but KO a pesky\nmeddler!
I took a serious licking!
Humph!\nThis was supposed to happen!\cMy mission was to just hold you up!
Yawn... Keeping watch over the\nHIDEOUT bores me. I'll take you on.
Yawn...\nOh, I lost...
If you scurry too much, other TEAM\n[EVIL_TEAM] members might get you.
Hehehe...\cGot here already, did you?\nWe underestimated you!\cBut this is it!\cI'm a cut above the GRUNTS you've seen\nso far.\cI'm not stalling for time. I'm going\nto pulverize you!
Hehehe...\nSo, I lost, too...
Hehehe!\cWhile I was toying with you, our BOSS\ngot through his preparations!
Hehehe!\cOur BOSS has already gone on his way to\nsome cave under the sea!\cIf you're going to give chase, you'd\nbetter search the big, wide sea beyond\rLILYCOVE.\cBut will you find it then?\nHehehe!
Wahahah, I grew weary of waiting!\nYou owe me a battle, too!
Tired of waiting...\nLost and dazed...
BOSS...\nIs this good enough?
Warp panels, the HIDEOUT's pride\nand joy!\cYou're clueless about where you are,\naren't you?\cFluster and tire out the enemy, then\nlower the boom! That's our plan!
What's wrong with you?\nYou're not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can't remember\nwhere I put the MASTER BALL.\cIf I fail to guard it, our BOSS will\nchew me out...
“SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1” is painted\non the hull.\cThis is the submarine TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]\nstole in SLATEPORT!\cTEAM [EVIL_TEAM] must have gone\nashore here.
We don't need a kid around!\nGo on home already!
I want to go home...
I want to get a promotion so I can\nboss around the GRUNTS...
That submarine... It's tiny inside.\nI'm sore all over!
Losing makes me sore!
That submarine we jacked, man, it's\nbrutal as a ride.\rIt's way too tight in there!
Ahahahaha!\cHow did you manage to get here without\na submarine?\rWhat an impressive child!\cBut... It won't do to have you\nmeddling about here.\cAnd, I do want payback for what\nhappened at the WEATHER INSTITUTE...\cI'm going to give you a little taste\nof pain! Resign yourself to it!
Ahahahaha!\cOuch!
Ahahahaha!\nYou're so darn strong.\cIt's terribly disappointing that you're\nnot a TEAM [EVIL_TEAM] member.\cYou could have enjoyed the fabulous\nworld our BOSS has promised to one\rof our own...
Who are you?\nWhere did you come in from?
Lost it...
I can't find the way out!\cI'm not afraid. Don't get me wrong!
WALLY: Hi! [PLAYER]!\cI bet you're surprised to see me here!\cI made it all the way here, and it's\nall thanks to you!\c[PLAYER], losing to you that time\nmade me stronger!\cBut I'm not going to lose anymore!\cI'm going to win! For the POKéMON who\ngave me courage and strength!\cOkay... Here I come!
Wow!\n[PLAYER], you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you today,\n[PLAYER], but one of these days, I'll\rcatch up to you!
WALLY: Hi! [PLAYER]!\cI've gotten stronger since that last\ntime! I wanted to show you, [PLAYER]!\cOkay... Here I come!
Wow!\n[PLAYER], you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you this time,\ntoo... But one of these days, [PLAYER],\rI'm going to catch up to you...\cAnd challenge the POKéMON LEAGUE!
I've made it this far a couple times,\nbut the last stretch is so long...
My dream ends here again...
You've made it this far. Keep the\nmomentum going and become the\rCHAMPION! If anyone can, it's you!
I didn't come all this way to lose now.\nThat possibility doesn't exist!
Impossible...\nI lost?
I lost here...\cThat means I lack the qualifications\nto become the CHAMPION...
This seemingly infinite and harsh road\nlives up to its name of VICTORY.
Your battle style is fantastic...
You seem to have the potential for\nbecoming the CHAMPION.
The thought that I'm getting closer to\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE...\cI'm getting stage fright...
I couldn't do a thing...
The POKéMON LEAGUE became distant\nagain... What a letdown...
To win your way through the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you need the trust of your\rPOKéMON.
Your relationship is based on\nsolid trust.
By being together all the time, trust\ngrows between POKéMON and TRAINERS.
This isn't the goal. It's only a place\non the way to the POKéMON LEAGUE.
That's the way!
You'll do fine, for sure!\nYour POKéMON are all eager to go!
I trained together with my whole family,\nevery one of us!\rI'm not losing to anyone!
Better than my family?!\nIs that possible?!
I was better than everyone in my\nfamily. I've never lost before...\cI've lost my confidence...\nMaybe I'll go home...
I'd heard that there was a tough\nlittle kid around. Do they mean you?
The little shrimp is tough!
The rumors I heard, that tough little\nkid is from PETALBURG CITY.
You must be getting a little tired.
No signs of tiring at all!
VICTORY ROAD and the POKéMON LEAGUE\nare long and grueling challenges.\rBeware of fatigue!
You shouldn't get complacent just\nbecause you have a lot of GYM BADGES.\cThere's always going to be someone\nwho's better than you!
You're better than me!
Gaze on your collected BADGES and\nremember the TRAINERS you've faced.
The penetrating cold around these\nparts is an impediment to training.\cBut with focus, one can overcome!\cWith this FOCUS BAND, buckle down and\nwithstand the cold!
Everything starts with focus!
The door is closed.
Use the BASEMENT KEY?
[PLAYER] used the BASEMENT KEY.\cThe door opened!
The generator is radiating heat that\ncan be felt even at a distance.\cIt looks like it should be turned off\nas soon as possible.
The generator quieted down.
[PLAYER] stepped on the switch.\cClick...\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe generator appears to have\nstopped...
What's so funny about having my inner\ntube aboard the ship?
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!
It's not easy throwing POKé BALLS\nwhile hanging on to an inner tube!
Isn't it fun here?\nI get excited just being here!
Ships of this sort are rare, so I'm\ntaking a look around.\cHmhm...\nThere appear to be other cabins...
When we go out to sea, we SAILORS\nalways bring our POKéMON.\rHow about a quick battle?
Whoops, I'm sunk!
The ship's bottom has sunk into the\ndepths.\cIf a POKéMON knew how to go underwater,\nwe might make some progress...
Yay!\nIt's a ship!
The door is locked.\c“STORAGE” is painted on the door.
[PLAYER] inserted and turned the\nSTORAGE KEY.\cThe inserted KEY stuck fast, but the\ndoor opened.
The door is open.
Urrrrppp...\cI'm getting queasy just being aboard\nthis ship...\cIt's not even moving, but...
This is a perfect place to go exploring!\nIt's exciting here!\cI bet there're amazing treasures on\nboard.
HAL: While searching for treasures,\nwe discovered a TRAINER!
HAL: We couldn't win even though\nwe worked together...
HAL: We can't find any treasures...\nI wonder if someone got them already?
HAL: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.
LOIS: Oh? We were looking for some\ntreasure, but we only found a TRAINER.
LOIS: Oh, wow, you're strong!
LOIS: I wonder where the treasures\nare hidden?\cI already know what I'm going to buy\nwhen I find them!
LOIS: Don't you have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle another time!
HAL: We've been searching for\ntreasures all this time.\cOur POKéMON have grown stronger, too.\nLet us show you, okay?
HAL: You're strong as usual!
HAL: We can't find any treasures,\nwe lose at POKéMON...\cI want to go home... But if I say that,\nshe gets all angry with me...
HAL: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.
LOIS: Oh, hi, we meet again!\cJust like us, you haven't given up\nsearching for treasures!\cHow about we battle, and the loser has\nto give up looking?
LOIS: Oh, we lost again...
LOIS: We'll raise our POKéMON more.\cWe're not going home until we find our\ntreasures!
LOIS: Don't you have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle another time!
I'm investigating this ship on behalf\nof CAPT. STERN.\cHe also asked me to find a SCANNER,\nbut I haven't had any success...
Oh! That's a SCANNER!\cListen, can I get you to deliver that\nto CAPT. STERN?\cI want to investigate this ship a\nlittle more.
This ship is called S.S. CACTUS.\nIt seems to be from an earlier era.

[PLAYER] inserted and turned the\nKEY.\cThe inserted KEY stuck fast, but the\ndoor opened.
It's bright and shiny!\nBut it's just trash...
There's a small indent in the wall.
There's a small indent in the wall.\cUse the SECRET POWER?
Discovered a small cavern!
Want to make your SECRET BASE here?
The box is printed with a POKéMON logo.\cIt's a POKéMON brand moving and\ndelivery service.
This ferry is built to plow through\nfast-running currents.\cWe hope you enjoy your voyage with us.\nFeel free to explore the ship.
We hope you enjoy your voyage on\nour ferry.
We have made land in SLATEPORT CITY.\nThank you for sailing with us.
We have made land in LILYCOVE CITY.\nThank you for sailing with us.
It'll be some time before we make land,\nI reckon.\cYou can rest up in your cabin if you'd\nlike. Your cabin's No. 2.\cThe bed in there is soft and plushy.\nI can attest to how comfy it is!
We've arrived!
Go visit other cabins.\nTRAINERS bored of the boat trip will\rbe itching to battle.
Enjoy your cruise!
The horizon spreads beyond the\nporthole.
MR. BRINEY: Welcome aboard, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cThey made me honorary captain of the\nS.S. TIDAL!\cYou can call me CAPTAIN BRINEY now!\cYou know, I retired once before, but\nwhen I saw this majestic ship...\cLet me just say, it stirred my sleeping\nsoul as a sailor!
PEEKO: Pihyo pihyohyo...
Cabin 1
Cabin 2
Cabin 3
Cabin 4
Arrrgh! I'm fed up and dog-tired of\ncleaning this huge place!\cLet's have a quick battle!
Little bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!\cThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
This is the bottom of the ship's hull.\nThere's plenty of room.\rIt'll be alright for a POKéMON battle.
Big bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!\cThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
It's a bed.\nLet's take a rest.
Go back and forth between LILYCOVE\nand SLATEPORT, that's what I do.\cIt's my hobby - going from port to port\nto take in POKéMON CONTESTS.
That was an enjoyable match!
I get so excited imagining what kinds\nof POKéMON I'll get to see in the next\rCONTEST. The anticipation of it thrills!
Are your friends strong?
Your friends are, indeed, strong.
Friends need not be human.\nFor me, POKéMON are treasured friends!
Child...\nDid you knock on the door?
A loss is to be accepted without haste\nor panic.
To be never ruffled in any situation is\nthe GENTLEMAN's code of conduct.
JED: I feel a little shy about this, but...\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
JED: Sigh...
JED: It's the first time that our lovey-\ndovey power couldn't prevail!\rYou must be an awesome TRAINER!
JED: You only have one POKéMON?\nIsn't that just too lonesome?
LEA: I feel a little silly, but...\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
LEA: Oh, boo!
LEA: I can't believe it!\nOur lovey-dovey power failed...\rYou must be an awesome TRAINER!
LEA: I wanted to battle...\nBut you don't even have two POKéMON...
Ah, you've come just in time.\cI'm bored, you see.\nYou may entertain me.
...That will do.
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire\na yacht for me.\rA yacht for me and POKéMON!
Oh, you're such an adorable TRAINER.\nWould you like to have tea?\rOr would you rather battle?
I see.\nYou're the active sort.
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its\ncharms, I must say...\cBut, I will admit there is an appealing\nside to touring HOENN by ferry.
Uh... Hi! I... I'm not acting suspicious!\nUh... You can have this! For free!\cIt... Honestly, I didn't SNATCH it from\nsomeone! I'd never do such a thing!\rIt's clean! You can use it!
SNATCH steals the foe's move in\nadvance, and then uses the snatched\rmove on the foe.
BATTLE TOWER\n“Win it all and be the best, TRAINERS!”
This is the BATTLE TOWER.\cTRAINERS bring their best-raised\nPOKéMON for elimination-style matches.
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET...\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
Please sail with us another time!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
I'm not leaving until I've beaten 35\nTRAINERS in a row!
Gee, there're a lot of tough-looking\nTRAINERS here.\rI'm not good enough to enter yet...
Welcome to the BATTLE TOWER!\cPlease register with me to enter\na BATTLE ROOM.
Would you like to make a BATTLE ROOM\nchallenge?
We'll be looking forward to your\nnext challenge.
Before entering a BATTLE ROOM, your\nprogress must be saved. Is that okay?
There are two BATTLE ROOMS,\nLevel 50 and Level 100.\rWhich would you like to challenge?

I'll direct you to your BATTLE ROOM now.
The BATTLE TOWER is a facility made\nespecially for POKéMON battles.\cWithin the TOWER are many BATTLE ROOMS.\cIn each BATTLE ROOM, seven TRAINERS\nawait your challenge.\cBeat all seven, and you will be rewarded\nwith a fabulous prize.\cYou may also take a break from your\nchallenge by saving your progress.\cMake sure you save properly or you\nwon't be able to resume your challenge.
Excuse me!\cYou don't have three eligible POKéMON.\cYou must have three different POKéMON\nof Level 50 or less to enter.\cThey also must be holding different\nkinds of items.\cEGGS[STR_VAR_1] ineligible.\cPlease come see me when you are ready.

Congratulations!\nYou've beaten all seven TRAINERS!\c
For beating seven TRAINERS in a row,\nyou have earned this fabulous prize!\c
[PLAYER] received the prize\n[STR_VAR_1].
Oh, your BAG appears to be full.\cPlease make room in your BAG, then come\nsee me.
Thank you for playing!\c
Your record will be saved.\nPlease wait.
We've been waiting for you!\c
Before entering a BATTLE ROOM, your\nprogress will be saved. Please wait.
You're finally about to face the\n50th TRAINER.\cFrom here on, every time you beat seven\nTRAINERS in a row, your POKéMON will\rreceive a commemorative RIBBON.\cGood luck!
Here are some RIBBONS for beating\nseven tough TRAINERS in a row.\c[PLAYER] received some RIBBONS!
[PLAYER] put the RIBBONS on the\nchallenger POKéMON.
Hello, hello!\nYou're going to battle here, right?\cCan you tell me what's going through\nyour mind as you prepare for battle?
Oh, wow, you'll tell me?\nGreat! Then, what's your answer?
Oh, so you don't think much about it?\nYou're one cool customer.
Hunh? You changed your mind?\nI guess you're fickle.
Okay, so that's how you feel?\nThat's quite original.\cThanks!
The number of matches you win in a row\nis recorded.\cThe record is posted beside the\nregistration counter.\cIt's also on the back of your\nTRAINER'S CARD.
Once you've entered the BATTLE TOWER,\nyou can't leave until you either lose\ror you beat seven TRAINERS in a row.\cYou'd best be certain that you're up\nto the challenge.
Hahahaha! Pure magnificence!\nPure magnificence indeed!\cDo you realize what you've achieved?\nYou've beaten 50 TRAINERS in a row!\cYes, purely magnificent!\cAs the OWNER of the BATTLE TOWER,\nlet me give you a memento!
Wahahaha! Pure magnificence!\nAbsolutely pure magnificence indeed!\cDo you realize what you've achieved?\nYou've beaten 100 TRAINERS in a row!\cYes, absolutely magnificent!\cAs the OWNER of the BATTLE TOWER,\nlet me give you a memento!
I suggest you keep it displayed.\nIt will surely attract attention.
Oh?\nYour PC has no room for this...\cBut it would be a shame to waste this...\nPlease come back for this!
I'm overwhelmed with satisfaction after\nseeing your magnificent performance.\cIt makes the building of the BATTLE\nTOWER all worthwhile!
We will restore your POKéMON to\nfull health.
You will be facing opponent no. [STR_VAR_1].\nAre you ready?
Would you like to save and\nquit the game?
Would you like to cancel your BATTLE\nROOM challenge?
Oh? You look like a good TRAINER.\nWill you look at my POKéMON?
I'm not good enough for you.
I enjoyed our battle very much.\nPlease battle with me some other time.
Go!\nGo, our POKéMON!
Oh... We couldn't win.
Did it surprise you that two POKéMON\nbattled at the same time?
You can't battle with us if you have\nonly one POKéMON.\rWhy? Because we're strong!
Hey, hey! This is my first battle in\na while. I'll give it my all!
But I gave it my all...
You're far too strong!\nYou must be a great TRAINER!
My POKéMON are extremely cute and\nextremely strong.\rPlease allow me to show you.
I must concede defeat.\nAfter all, you are strong.
The next time we meet, I will have raised\nmy POKéMON much more.\cDon't expect mercy then!
We HIKERS are always full of energy!\nMy POKéMON are also full of energy, too.\rWe're always itching for a battle!
We ran out of energy...
Wahahah! Sure, we lost!\nBut we had a great battle, didn't we?\rWe're satisfied with that!
You look like a strong TRAINER,\nbut can you beat us?
Waaah!\nWe lost!
If two POKéMON can battle at the same\ntime, all sorts of new things can happen.
Do you only have one POKéMON that can\nbattle?\cThen we can't battle with you yet.
Have you tried beating all the other\nTRAINERS in battle?
Thanks for coming today!\cI hope you're looking forward to this\ngame's release!
Huh? Did you battle with all the\nTRAINERS already?
Thank you for coming today!\cI hope you're looking forward to this\ngame's release!
I've never seen the POKéMON you have.\nIt makes me envious a little.
Look at all those TRAINERS!\nThey have different POKéMON, too.\rAnd they're all waiting for you!
Welcome to the World of POKéMON!
May all POKéMON battles be bright,\nfun, and ferocious!
I have to stay home today.\cMy big sisters had to go out.\nThey said it was for preparations.\cIn the autumn, we're going to start\na flower shop. Please wait for it!
I'm the owner of the SEASHORE HOUSE.\nBut you can call me MR. SEA!\cWhat I love above all is to see hot\nPOKéMON battles.\cLet me see that your heart burns hot!\cIf you can defeat all the TRAINERS\nhere, I'll reward your efforts.
Show me some hot matches!\cI run this SEASHORE HOUSE just for\nthat reason alone!
You're scorching hot!\nThose battles blazed!\rI'm more than just satisfied!\cAs thanks for showing me your hot\nstreak, I want you to take these.\cIt's half a dozen bottles of SODA POP!
Oh, but hey, your BAG's jammed full.\nI'll hang on to these for you.
Want to buy some SODA POP?\nPOKéMON love it!\cJust $300 a bottle!\nBuy some!
Here you go!
You don't have the money.
No?\nThat's too bad.
SODA POP! The POKéMON favorite!\nJust $300 a bottle! Want one?
Here you go!
Oh, dear!\nYou don't have enough money.
That's too bad.
If you're looking for a battle on the\nhigh seas, you'll find no hotter \rTRAINER than me, matey!
That was a hot battle!\nI can accept that loss, matey!
Whenever I'm in SLATEPORT, I enjoy\nhot battles and ice-cold SODA POP!
Boring battles aren't worth the effort.\cFiery hot battles are what toughen up\nTRAINERS and POKéMON!
That's hot!
Whew, I'm all thirsty.\nMaybe I'll have a SODA POP.
I'm going to show you how great my\nPOKéMON are, but don't cry!
...I lost, but I won't cry...
If one of my POKéMON knew the move\nfor carrying me across water on its\rback, I could get rid of this inner tube.
You're being watched...
Hah? Grrr...\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nbeneath this desk? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nbehind this tree? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nin this dresser? You're sharp!

Behold!\cFor I am the greatest living mystery\nof a man in all of HOENN!\rThey call me...\cThe TRICK MASTER!\nWahahaha! Glad to meet you!
You, you've come to challenge my\nTRICK HOUSE, haven't you?\cThat's why you're here, isn't it?\nYes, it is!\cConsider your challenge accepted!\cEnter through the scroll there,\nand let your challenge commence!\cI shall be waiting in the back!
It's a scroll.
There is a big hole behind the scroll!\cWant to go in?
There is a note affixed to the scroll...\c“I am leaving on a journey.\nDon't look for me. TRICK MASTER”
For the next time, I'll use this trick,\nand that scheme, and those ruses...\cMufufufu... If I may say so, it's\nbrilliantly difficult, even for me!
Hah? What?!\nOh, it's you!\cI'm in the midst of devising new tricky\nchallenges!\cIt's not too much to ask for a bit more\ntime for me to think, is it now?\rYou wouldn't begrudge me that?\rCome back in a little while!
Ah, it's you! You're here to accept the\nreward from before, isn't that right?\rYes, right I am!\cHere!\nI'll give it to you now!
Hah?\nDid you not come to claim your reward?
MECHADOLL 5 I AM!\nIF REWARD IS NOT TAKEN BY YOU,\rTHEN TRICK MASTER YOU CANNOT FOLLOW.
THEN FAREWELL.
YOUR PC STATUS: FULL AGAIN.\nMEAN, YOU ARE.
[PLAYER] found a scroll.
[PLAYER] memorized the secret code\nwritten on the scroll.
A secret code is written on it.
The door is locked.\c...On closer inspection, this is written\non it: “Write the secret code here.”
Aak!\nYou've made it to me?\rHmmm... You're sharp!
It took me all night to plant all those\ntrees...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four, five, six places!
It took me all night to make the maze...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four, five places!
It took me all night to bring in those\nboulders...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four places!
It took me all night to shove in those\nboulders...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three places!
It took me all night to make MECHADOLLS\nand another to think up the quiz...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two places!
It took me all night to install\nthe doors...\cYou're almost my equal in greatness!
It took me all night setting up arrows...\cYou're my equal in greatness!
It took me all night polishing floors...\cYou're above me in greatness!\nPossibly...
Wh-what should I do?\nMy fountain of ideas for tricks has\rrun dry...\cPerhaps it is time I toured the country\non a quest to devise new tricks...
I hate to admit defeat, but you have\nbested me!\cStill, you must have been reeled in by\nmy charisma for you to visit me again\rand again. Yes, you must have!\cBut that has nothing to do with my\nlosing!\cIn recognition of the friendship\nbetween you, the driven, and the genius\rthat is myself, I demand that you take\rthis keepsake!
What? No room in your PC?\nWhat am I to make of that?\cI wish I could say that, but I am much\ntoo kind and caring, so come back later!
... ... ... ... ... ...\cI am leaving on a journey of discovery.\nA quest in search of new tricks.\cI wish that you will one day visit and\nentertain me again.\cAnd now, farewell!
Fine!\nYou have earned this reward!
What? Have you no room for this?\nWhat manner of items do you carry?\cBut fine, since you've reached me,\nyour reward will be with me till later.
Scrub that smug smirk from your face!\nIt's much too early to think you've won!\cI'll make new tricks to stump you, I will.\nYou may mock me only when you're done.\cCome back for the next exciting\ninstallment!
Now, now! You're ignoring me now?\nNow that, I consider heartbreaking!
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is fabulous.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
I'll hack and slash my way to victory\nwith the CUT we just learned!
Why are you so serious?
I never get tired of hacking\nand slashing!
I wandered into this weird house\nby accident...
And now I've lost...
I lost my way, I lost a battle, and I'm\neven more lost... I can't get out...
Just who is the TRICK MASTER?
I lost while I was lost in thought!
You're strong!\nJust who are you?
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is smart.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
Which switch closes which hole?
After that battle, I'm even more\nconfused!
Can I get you to push all the buttons\nfor me?
Oh! You're on your second TRICK HOUSE\nchallenge!
You're good at battling too?
The TRICK MASTER rigged all the tricks\nin this house all by himself.
I want to make my own GYM one day.\nSo, I'm studying how to set traps.
I didn't study battling enough!
You're strong, aren't you?\nMaybe even enough to be a GYM LEADER!
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is coveted.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
I keep coming back to this same place!
I'm already having trouble, and then\nyou have to beat me? It's not fair!
It's full of doors here!\nIt's too small and dark in here! Help!
I don't know what's going on here.\nI'm starting to feel sad...
You... You're awful!
I know I'm weak!\nAnd, I have no sense of direction!
I don't get it. What would anyone want\nwith a house this bizarre?
I don't get it.\nHow did I lose?
I don't get it.\nHow many traps are in this house?\cYou may be the one to solve that.
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is cool.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
It's too much bother to think this out.\nI only wanted to battle!
Even though I lost, I still like battling\nthe best!
Wouldn't you agree? You would go\nanywhere if TRAINERS were there.
Heh! Boulders like this, I can brush\naside with one finger!
I can push boulders, but I can't solve\nthe puzzle...
It's not good enough to be brawny...\nYou have to use your head. Be brainy!
The TRICK HOUSE is getting trickier,\nisn't it?
Aaak!
Has anyone made it to the end?

When I heard there was a strange\nhouse, I had to check it out.
I've discovered a tough TRAINER!
I'm sure having a good time checking\nthis place out.\cIt's a challenge I've found worth\nrepeating!
Maybe I could get my BIRD POKéMON\nto fly over the wall...
Gwaaah! I blew it!
Ehehehe... I guess I lost because I\nwas trying to cheat.
I'm getting dizzy from these rotating\ndoors...
Everything's spinning around and\naround. I can't take this anymore...
You don't seem to be affected at all.\nOr do you have your poker face on?
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is huggable.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
The TRICK MASTER always vanishes\nlike smoke. How does he do it?
Aiyeeeh! You're much too strong!\nHow do you do it?
I wish I could appear and disappear as\nif I were smoke, too.
Going around the same spot...\nIt begets ill fortune...
Defeated!\nIt's a bad sign...
I've circled the same spot over ten\ntimes now... It's ill fortune...
Whoever wins will get through here\nfirst. That's the feeling I get.
Oh!\nWell, go ahead, then!
You're solving all the puzzles in the\nTRICK HOUSE. That's the feeling I get.
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER I love.”\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThe lock clicked open!
Not many TRAINERS have made it\nthis far.
That must mean you're tough, too...
You've beaten the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION? That's too much!
Consider yourself lucky to be\nbattling me!
This isn't right!\nI can't lose!
It's a miracle that you beat me.\nYou can brag about it.
You've been slugging through the TRICK\nHOUSE challenge, too.
I see...\nYou possess an extraordinary style.
Seeing someone like you should please\nthe TRICK MASTER.
On CYCLING ROAD, you can go all out\nand cycle as fast as you'd like.\cIt feels great to go that fast, but try\nnot to crash into anyone!
Sorry, you can't walk on CYCLING\nROAD. It's too dangerous.\cPlease come back with a BIKE.

This area is covered in volcanic ash,\nhuff-puff!\cI'm specially gifted, huff-puff.\cI make glass out of volcanic ash\nand make items, huff-puff.\cGo collect ashes with this, huff-puff.
Just take that SOOT SACK and walk\nthrough piles of ash, huff-puff.\cAnd it will fill up with the volcanic ash,\nhuff-puff.\cOnce you think you've collected a good\namount, come see me, huff-puff.
Have you collected ashes, huff-puff?\nLet me see, huff-puff.
Hmmm...\nThere's not enough ash here, huff-puff.\rI can't make glass with this, huff-puff.\cLet's see... [STR_VAR_1] is the number of steps\nyou'll need to walk for me to make you\ra BLUE FLUTE, huff-puff.
Oh!\nYou've got a lot of ashes, huff-puff!\cI'll make you a glass item, huff-puff!\nWhich one would you like, huff-puff?

It's fun to blow a glass flute while my\nboss is talking.\cHuff-huff! Puff-puff!
The BOSS got interested in the\nresearch they have going here, so he\rsent us out.\cYou quit meddling!
Blast it...\nBlasted by a kid...
Our BOSS knows everything.\cBut I'm just a GRUNT. What would I know\nabout what he's thinking?
Huh?\nWhat's a kid doing here?
Huh?\nI lost?!
Oh, no...\nI'll catch an earful for losing to a kid...\cI should just take a nap in the bed...
While I was sleeping, everyone went\nupstairs!
Wow, you're really strong!\cI wish I could be a POKéMON TRAINER\nlike you!
The PROFESSOR loves rain.\nThat's a fact.\cBut if it keeps raining, people will be in\ntrouble. That's another fact.\cAnd thus, the PROFESSOR is studying\nif the rain can be put to good use.
Hello!\nWe've been saved by your actions!\cWhat I don't understand is what on\nearth the [EVIL_TEAM]S were up to.
There's a bed...\nLet's take a rest.
The INSTITUTE created a type of\nPOKéMON that has something to do with\rthe weather. We're here to take them!
Our plan's being spoiled by a kid?
If the POKéMON they made here can\ncontrol the weather freely, then we of\rTEAM [EVIL_TEAM] definitely need it!
We're TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]!\nWe appear wherever anything rare is\rfound!
You got me!
You don't have any idea what we of\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM] are working towards!\rYou stay out of our way!
Ahahahaha!\cYou're going to meddle in TEAM [EVIL_TEAM]'s\naffairs?\cYou're either absolutely fearless,\nsimply ignorant, or both!\cYou're so cute, you're disgusting!\nI'll put you down, kiddy!
Ahahahaha!\nYou're disgustingly strong!
Ahahahaha!\nWe got meddled with unexpectedly!\cWe're out of options.\nWe'll have to pull out.\cBut this isn't the last you'll see of\nTEAM [EVIL_TEAM]! We have other plans!\rDon't you forget it!
Thanks!\nThanks to you, we're safe!\cIt might be an odd way of thanking you,\nbut take this POKéMON.
Hm? You don't seem to have any room\nfor this POKéMON.
[PLAYER] received CASTFORM!
That POKéMON changes shape according\nto the weather conditions.\cThere're plenty of them in the\nINSTITUTE - go ahead and take it.
I've been researching rain for many\nyears, but it's ridiculous to think that\rhumans can freely change the weather.
I heard about a cave called the CAVE\nOF ORIGIN.\cPeople rumor that the spirits of\nPOKéMON are revived there.\rCould something like that really happen?
WINGULL: Pihyo?
I'm the DIVING TREASURE HUNTER!\cI'm the awesome dude who makes\ndeep-sea dives to gather treasures\rresting at the bottom.
Tell me, have you seen any SHARDS of\ntools made in ancient times?
You haven't got any treasures\nfor me...\cIf you see any SHARDS, like the RED\nSHARD, you've got to trade it with me!
Oh, hey! That...\nThat's a SHARD! I'm looking for those!\cOh, man, you've got to trade that\nwith me! I'll give you something good!
What do you want to trade?
You'll trade your [STR_VAR_1] for\nmy [STR_VAR_2], then?
It's a done deal!\nUse that wisely!
Do you want to trade something else?
Whoops, your BAG's full.\nGet rid of some items, friend!
No? That's a downer.\nWell, if you change your mind, come back.

Welcome to my POKéMON LAB.\cI carry out research on battling in\nsecrecy.
A big mansion is nice, but I like this\nsort of place more.\cI like it because all kinds of people\ncome visit me.\cSo, how would you like a battle?
That's the way!
When you're ready, give me a shout!
Aww! Done in!\nBut it's still fun to battle!
Well, anyway, I should go buy some\ndecorations and furniture.\cI want my SECRET BASE to be a place\nother people can enjoy.
A big mansion is nice, but I like this\nsort of place more.\cI like it because all kinds of people\ncome visit me.
I simply adore shopping for decorations\nand furniture.\cI also love raising POKéMON just\nas much.\cIf you would be so kind, will you battle\nwith my POKéMON?

I concede...
That was all in good fun!\nI should go enjoy shopping now.

I'm not going down easily!
Oh... Are you maybe tired from searching\nfor this place?
I went down...
Where's your SECRET BASE?\nI should go visit you there.
Some people make their SECRET BASES in\nhard-to-find places.\rDo they want to just lie low?
People have told me that you can get\ndecorations in several ways.\cWe should have a race to see who can\nget nicer decorations and furniture!\cIn the meantime, want to battle?
This is my SECRET BASE.\nI can't lose!
I'll battle with you anytime.
Huh?\nDid I just lose?
I won't lose at collecting decorations.\nCome visit again!

Oh, hello! You were in a POKéMON CONTEST,\nweren't you?\rIt's easy to tell from your POKéMON.\cI'm a reporter. I'm working on a story\non POKéMON CONTESTS.\cIf I may, would you be willing to answer\na few questions?
Oh, you will?\nThank you.\cBriefly, how would you describe the\nCONTEST you just entered?
Ah, I see.\nThat's a very edifying comment.\cYou get a good feel for what the\nCONTEST was like.\cI've got one last question.\cWhen you hear the word “[STR_VAR_2],”\nwhat image do you get?
I see!\cSo that's how you imagine the concept\nof “[STR_VAR_2]” to be.\cThank you!\nYou've given me some good ideas.\cI think I can write a good story on\nPOKéMON CONTESTS now.\cMaybe, just maybe, this story will even\nmake it to television.\rI hope you'll look forward to it!
Oh, too bad...\cWell, if you come across a good story,\nplease do share it with me.
I'll be looking forward to your next\nPOKéMON CONTEST.
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\cToday, we're going to profile a POKéMON\nbelonging to [STR_VAR_1].\cNow, this POKéMON boasts a [STR_VAR_2]\nrating in the [STR_VAR_3] Rank.
Introducing [STR_VAR_2] the\n[STR_VAR_1]!\cThe nickname [STR_VAR_2]...\cEven the nickname exudes an air that\nproclaims “[STR_VAR_3]”!
Anyway, when the TRAINER [STR_VAR_1]\nentered the POKéMON in a CONTEST,\rwe managed to get a few impassioned\rquotes about the trusty partner.
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n[STR_VAR_1] happily replied with a huge\rgrin, “[STR_VAR_2]!”\cWell, sure, [STR_VAR_1]'s POKéMON came in\nnumber [STR_VAR_3] in the CONTEST.\cThat line perfectly suits [STR_VAR_1]\nright now, I'd say!
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n[STR_VAR_1] replied with a tinge of\rbitterness, “[STR_VAR_2].”\cWell, sure, [STR_VAR_1]'s POKéMON came in\nnumber [STR_VAR_3] in the CONTEST.\c[STR_VAR_1]'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!
Wouldn't you also like to know what\n[STR_VAR_1] imagines [STR_VAR_2] to be?\cYou bet we did!\nSo we asked, of course!\cThe answer is all perfectly condensed:\n“[STR_VAR_3]!”\cThat's what the concept of [STR_VAR_2]\nrepresents to [STR_VAR_1]!
The last move [STR_VAR_2] used by\nthe [STR_VAR_1] is entirely about\r“[STR_VAR_3]”!
Bravo, [STR_VAR_1]!\nBravo, [STR_VAR_2]!\cI hope we can count on seeing\n[STR_VAR_1] scale even greater heights!\cThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!
Introducing the TRAINER's [STR_VAR_1]!
Hello! You're the TRAINER who just had\na battle, right?\cI'm gathering interviews with TRAINERS\nall over the place.\cMay I get a few words from you about\nyour impressions on battling?
You will? Really?\nThank you!\rThen, uh...\cHow did things turn out in the BATTLE\nTOWER today?\cWere you satisfied with the battle?\nOr are you unhappy?
Oh...\nSorry we disturbed you.\cPlease give us an interview the next\ntime you visit the BATTLE TOWER.
Well, of course!\cThat unmistakable look of satisfaction\non your face...\cIt's obvious that you've had a great\nbattle.
Oh, I see...\cWell, it certainly is difficult to make a\nbattle turn out exactly as planned.
Oh, oh, may I ask one more question?\cIf you were to describe your\nimpressions about this battle with one\rsaying, what would it be?
Oh, that is stunningly cool!\cThat's a great line!\nI hope you'll do great next time, too.\cI hope to see you again!
Oh, I see...\cStill, being the silent type is also cool,\nisn't it?\cI hope you'll give me the opportunity to\nshare your thoughts again!
I'll be looking forward to your next\nbattle!
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\cToday, we're going to profile [STR_VAR_1],\nwho took the BATTLE TOWER challenge!\cFor the challenge, [STR_VAR_1] entered one\nwicked [STR_VAR_2].
The pair set a new record of [STR_VAR_2] wins\nin a row in Level [STR_VAR_1] competition!\rBravo, TRAINER!
The twosome finally succumbed to\n[STR_VAR_1] in match number [STR_VAR_2].\rNice try, TRAINER!\cBut, hey, it's just bad luck to run into\n[STR_VAR_1] so early in the challenge.\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the match with [STR_VAR_1].
The twosome won it all by defeating\n[STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2] thoroughly.\rBravo, TRAINER!\cKnocking off even [STR_VAR_1]...\nIt defies belief! Simply astounding!\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the moment of glory.
After a string of wins, the pair finally\nsuccumbed to [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2],\rtheir final hurdle.\cNice try, TRAINER!\cStill, you have to give credit.\nYou don't see many famous combinations\rlike [STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2].\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non battling the celebrity pair.
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm satisfied!”\cNow isn't that a refreshing reply?\nBravo, TRAINER!\cIsn't it out-and-out awesome to be able\nto battle to full satisfaction?\cI found out exactly how satisfied\nwhen I heard the TRAINER say this:
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm not satisfied...”\cOur TRAINER was obviously a little down\nwhen that was uttered.\cStill, it's not easy to be able to battle\nwith complete satisfaction, am I right?\cAnyway, I found out how dissatisfied\nour TRAINER was when I heard this:
None
None
None
None
“[STR_VAR_1].”
“[STR_VAR_1].”\nNow isn't that great?\cIt really expresses [STR_VAR_2]'s joy,\nI'd say.\cThat battle with [STR_VAR_3] at the\nend... It really was what you'd call\r“[STR_VAR_1]”!
“[STR_VAR_1].”\nNow isn't that fitting?\cThat battle with [STR_VAR_3] at the\nend... You can't describe it as anything\relse but “[STR_VAR_1]”!\c[STR_VAR_2]'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!
Bravo, [STR_VAR_1]!\nBravo, [STR_VAR_2]!\cI hope we can count on seeing\n[STR_VAR_1] scale even greater heights!\cThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!
Wow!\cIt's plain to see that you lavish your\nlove on your [STR_VAR_1].\cOkay, it's named [STR_VAR_2].\cCan I ask you a favor?\cI'm a TV reporter, and I'm running\na survey on POKéMON.\cWould you be willing to answer a few\nsimple questions for me?
Great! Thank you!\cOkay, here goes.\nI just need quick answers, okay?

This question also relates to your\nbeloved [STR_VAR_1].\cWhat was it about [STR_VAR_1] that\nattracted you?
Okay, that makes sense.\cThe next question might be a little\non the tough side.\cHere goes...\cWhat do POKéMON mean to you?

Hi, you seem to be very close to your\n[STR_VAR_1].\cDo you know what?\nI'm a TV reporter.\cI travel around interviewing people\nabout POKéMON.\cI'm wondering if you'd be willing to tell\nme a little abut your [STR_VAR_1]?
Wow, thank you!\cOkay, then, please tell me anything you'd\nlike about your [STR_VAR_1].
Wow...\nThat's an interesting account.\cYou really are tight with [STR_VAR_1],\naren't you?\cI get the feeling that your account\nwill make a great TV story.\cI promise that I'll turn this into\nan entertaining show.\rKeep your eyes out for it.\cOkay, that's all.\nBye-bye!

We asked [STR_VAR_1], “When you first\nlaid eyes on your [STR_VAR_2], what was\ryour initial thought?“\c“[STR_VAR_3]!“\cYeahah! That's a mighty fine shout!\cDoesn't it bring back memories of those\ndays long gone by?
We asked [STR_VAR_1], “If you were to\nliken your [STR_VAR_2] to something,\rit would be...”\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\c“[STR_VAR_3]!”\cWhoah-oh, now that's an original idea!\cYou sure can sense the intensity of\nfeeling the TRAINER has for\r[STR_VAR_2].
And let's see...\nWhat was it about that [STR_VAR_2]\rthat so attracted [STR_VAR_1]?\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\c“[STR_VAR_3]!”\cWhoa! Such a spectacular declaration!\cThe love of this TRAINER for the\n[STR_VAR_2] comes across loud and clear!
Hm?

Whoah!\nWhat an amazing letter!
I loved it, so here it is again!
A great letter bears reading over\nand over!
The bit “[STR_VAR_3],” that really\naccentuates emotional impact!\cIt's a great letter that has real\nheartfelt depth!
Especially that “[STR_VAR_3]” bit!\cI love how “[STR_VAR_3]” is used!
By the way, and it's not important,\nbut “[STR_VAR_3]” is a great saying.\cI've been using “[STR_VAR_3]” a lot\nin conversations lately.
If I had to score this letter,\nI'd give it [STR_VAR_3] points.\cNext time, I'll be expecting an even\nbetter letter, [STR_VAR_1]!\cA-whoops, will you look at the time?\nTime to say good-bye until next time!
Oh?\nDo you perhaps like POKéMON?\cI'm on assignment with the TV network.\cI'm gathering stories on POKéMON and\nTRAINERS that occurred recently.\cIf you don't mind, could you tell me\nsomething about yourself?
I'm gathering stories on POKéMON and\nTRAINERS that occurred recently.\cIf you don't mind, could you tell me\nsomething about yourself?
Oh, you will?\nThank you!\cThen, please, tell me anything of\ninterest that you experienced recently\rinvolving POKéMON.
Oh, I see...\cWell, if you do have an interesting\nstory to tell, please let me know.
Oh, what an uplifting story!\cI'll be sure to get your story told\non television.\cIt should be aired sometime, I think,\nso please look forward to it.
Hmmm...\nI've got a good story for a TV program.\cI'd better write it up in a hurry!
Hello, it's time for RECENT HAPPENINGS.\cFor POKéMON TRAINERS, every day is\na storybook tale.\cWhat we want to do is to introduce you\nto some of these POKéMON tales.\cToday, we bring you the story of the\nTRAINER [STR_VAR_1].\cWhat did [STR_VAR_1] experience recently?\nLet's find out.\cLet's see...
Wasn't that enlightening?\cThe story gives you a clear idea of what\n[STR_VAR_1] has experienced recently.\rIt's as if we were there as witnesses!
“[STR_VAR_3].” That\naccents the tale and gives it depth.
“[STR_VAR_3].”\nThat gives the tale a sense of place.\rIt lets us envision the tale's setting.
The “[STR_VAR_3]”\nsection of the tale is very expressive.
[STR_VAR_1] has recounted a wonderful\ntale involving POKéMON.\cAnd now [STR_VAR_1]'s tale is indelibly\netched into your soul, too.\cThat's it for today.\nPlease tune in next time.
Greetings!\nIt's time for POKéMON NEWS.\cWe've just received word of a very\nrare occurrence.\cThere have been reports of a mass\noutbreak of [STR_VAR_2] in the vicinity\rof [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_2], as you're probably aware,\nis known as a POKéMON that's rare\rand hard to find.\cIt sounds like a rare opportunity to\nsee the mystifying outbreak of\r[STR_VAR_2] in the wild.\cThat's the news on POKéMON NEWS.
And now, it's time for...\nTHE NAME RATER SHOW.\cI tell your POKéMON's fortune from\nthe nickname you've bestowed.\cAdvice is what I have to give, and it is\nhelpful advice that I offer.\cToday, I shall prophesize the nickname\n[STR_VAR_3] of [STR_VAR_1]'s POKéMON\r[STR_VAR_2].\cHmhm...\cHmm...\nThis nickname is...
A nickname that hints at talent in many\ndifferent ways.\cI urge this TRAINER to take courage\nand take on many challenges.
A nickname that perfectly complements\n[STR_VAR_1], the TRAINER's name.\cIt suggests that you will forge a fine\npartnership with precise timing.
A nickname fit for a unique individual\nof a POKéMON!\cIf raised properly, this POKéMON's\nuniqueness will bloom excessively!
A nickname that will nurture the caring\nand compassionate side of POKéMON.\cIf raised properly, this POKéMON will\ncome to exhibit real warmth!
A very fine nickname that hints at\ngreatness to come.\cI am intrigued about what the future\nholds in store for this POKéMON.
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON hale and hearty!\cThat POKéMON should remain fit and\nrobust for a long, long time.
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON very active!\cI should think that this POKéMON will be\na strong performer in battles.
An appealing nickname that should make\nthe POKéMON very charming!\cI don't doubt that this POKéMON will be\nquite the charmer in POKéMON CONTESTS.
The nickname [STR_VAR_1] is rooted by\nthe letter “[STR_VAR_3].”\cThat letter is supported by the first\nletter “[STR_VAR_2],” which gives it a solid sense\rof presence as a nickname.
The nickname [STR_VAR_1] is very\nshapely in a pleasing manner.\cThe presence of the letters “[STR_VAR_2]” and\n“[STR_VAR_3]” - now that is remarkably good!
The nickname [STR_VAR_1] - it has a\nsublime, flowing feel to it.\cThe flow from the initial letter “[STR_VAR_2]” to\n“[STR_VAR_3]” is especially wonderful.
Let's examine other examples of fine\nnicknames, shall we?
Try this example. Take a part of the\nTRAINER name of [STR_VAR_1], and end\rup with the fine nickname [STR_VAR_2][STR_VAR_3].
The nickname [STR_VAR_2][STR_VAR_3] would also work\nquite well.
The POKéMON's species name of\n[STR_VAR_2] could be used as the basis\rfor making the nickname [STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3].
[STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3] would also be an effective\nnickname.
What should always be avoided is using\nanother POKéMON species name.\cFor instance, avoid taking the name of\n[STR_VAR_2] to make the nickname [STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3].\rThat is unacceptable.
But I must say, [STR_VAR_2] has a most\nremarkable flair for devising nicknames.\cIt is my hope that the TRAINER will\ncontinue to treat [STR_VAR_1] with love.\cThat's it for today's show.\nMay we meet again.
[STR_VAR_2] ANGLER\cANNOUNCER: Hello! Today, we'll get tips\non fishing for [STR_VAR_2].\cGURU, what advice can you give for\ncatching [STR_VAR_2]?\cGURU: Hm? Catching [STR_VAR_2]?\nWell, let me tell you, be patient and wait.\rThat's the bottom line.\cDo you see [STR_VAR_1] over there?\nThat TRAINER makes a good example.\cThat TRAINER's already had [STR_VAR_3]\nPOKéMON get away.\cBut there [STR_VAR_1] waits. No giving up.\nThat's the law for catching [STR_VAR_2].\cANNOUNCER: I see...\cOh! [STR_VAR_1] has finally landed an\nelusive [STR_VAR_2]!\cThe TRAINER appears close to tears\nout of sheer joy!\cSeeing that elated look, I'm getting\nthe itch to go fishing, too!\cViewers, why not take this as a cue to\ntry some [STR_VAR_2] fishing?\cUntil our next broadcast, farewell and\ngood fishing to you all!

Hello!\cIt's time for POKéMON TODAY!\cBIG SIS: Hi! Is everyone peachy and\nperky today?\cToday, we're going to look at [STR_VAR_1]'s\nPOKéMON [STR_VAR_2]!\cBIG BRO: Yeah! That's what we're going\nto do!
Oh!\nSpeaking of [STR_VAR_1]...\cBIG SIS, I saw the TRAINER with my very\nown eyes!\cBIG SIS: Oh, what did you see?\cBIG BRO: Well, I had to go on a trip to\n[STR_VAR_2].\cThat's when I happened to come across\n[STR_VAR_1], who was trying to catch the\rPOKéMON [STR_VAR_3], but...
The POKéMON managed to get away!\cIt ended up wasting this many\nPOKé BALLS: [STR_VAR_2]!\cYou should have seen the expression\nof frustration on [STR_VAR_1]'s face when\rthe POKéMON took off!
But [STR_VAR_1] goofed and made the\nPOKéMON faint!\cIt ended up wasting this many\nPOKé BALLS: [STR_VAR_2]!\cYou should have seen the expression\nof stunned dismay on [STR_VAR_1]'s face\rwhen the POKéMON fainted!
BIG SIS: Hey, there!\nThat's not nice!\cYou shouldn't be laughing at other\npeople's misfortune!\cOh, poor [STR_VAR_1].\nWhat a shame!\cBIG BRO: That's true!\nSorry for laughing.
BIG SIS: Bufufu...\cBIG BRO: Hey!\nYou just laughed, too!\cBIG SIS: Huh?!\cI didn't laugh!\nHonestly, I didn't!\cOh, poor [STR_VAR_1].\nWhat a shame!\cBIG BRO: ...
BIG SIS: That's enough silliness!\nLet's look at today's POKéMON...\cHuh?\nWe're out of time already?\cAww!\nWe couldn't profile a POKéMON today!\cBIG BRO: See you again next time!\cBIG SIS: Hey, don't end the show\nwithout me!
Hello!\cIt's time for POKéMON TODAY!\cBIG SIS: Hi! Is everyone peachy and\nperky today?\cToday, we're going to look at [STR_VAR_1]'s\nPOKéMON [STR_VAR_2]!\cBIG BRO: Yeah! That's what we're going\nto do!
BIG SIS: [STR_VAR_1] gave the nickname\n[STR_VAR_3] to the [STR_VAR_2]!\cIt sounds like [STR_VAR_3] is getting\ngood, loving care!
BIG BRO: The TRAINER had to throw this\nmany BALLS to catch it: [STR_VAR_3]!\cIt finally took a single [STR_VAR_2]\nto catch it!
BIG SIS: If it was that easy to catch,\nit must have been destiny that brought\r[STR_VAR_1] and the [STR_VAR_2] together!
BIG SIS: Wow! That's so neat!\cBut you know what they say, a POKéMON\nthat takes a lot of effort to catch\rearns the love of its TRAINER!
BIG SIS: [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2] is a\nmemorable POKéMON because it took an\rinvaluable MASTER BALL to catch!\cBIG BRO: Wow! That's mega-awesome!\cBIG SIS: [STR_VAR_1] must have really\nwanted that [STR_VAR_2], for sure!
BIG BRO: Then to give the nickname\n[STR_VAR_3] to that [STR_VAR_2]...\cYou really get a good idea about\n[STR_VAR_1]'s TRAINER sense.\cBIG SIS: I second that notion!
If it were me, I'd give that\nnickname to something like [STR_VAR_3]!\cBIG BRO: Whoa! That could be the start\nof something new!
[STR_VAR_2] the [STR_VAR_1]?\nDoesn't that sound perfect?\cThe letters and everything - they sound\njust right for the POKéMON [STR_VAR_1]!\cBIG BRO: Yeah, true, that!
As far as I know, no TRAINER has ever\ngiven the nickname [STR_VAR_2] to their\r[STR_VAR_1]!\cBIG BRO: That just goes to show what\ngreat taste the TRAINER has in picking\rnicknames!
The next time I catch a POKéMON,\nI should give it the name [STR_VAR_2].\cBIG BRO: Huh? Me, too!\nI'll use the nickname [STR_VAR_2], too!
BIG SIS: Oh, no!\nLook at the time!\cWell, gang, this is it for today.\nSee you again next time!\cBIG BRO: Remember, it could be your\nPOKéMON in the spotlight next time!
Hello!\cIt's time for TODAY'S SMART SHOPPER.\cINTERVIEWER: How are you, viewers?\cToday we're visiting a shop\nin [STR_VAR_2].\cLet's check on what the hot sellers\nhave been recently.
Let's interview the clerk to get the\nlowdown.\cHi, how's your business?\cCLERK: Oh, we're doing excellent.\cRecently, [STR_VAR_2] has been selling\nespecially strongly.\cWhy, just the other day a TRAINER\nnamed [STR_VAR_1] bought [STR_VAR_3].
INTERVIEWER: The TRAINER bought\n[STR_VAR_3] [STR_VAR_2]S? That's a haul!\cIf I may say so, [STR_VAR_1] must have\nbeen stocking up for a long journey\rto far-off places.\cFor traveling, [STR_VAR_2]S are so\nimportant!
INTERVIEWER: Speaking of the item\n[STR_VAR_2], I just bought [STR_VAR_3] of\rthem recently.\cAfter all, [STR_VAR_2]'s a great item!
INTERVIEWER: [STR_VAR_2]?!\nBut [STR_VAR_3] of them?!\cI didn't think there would be anyone\nbuying that many.\cMy goodness, I can only afford one or\ntwo at a time...
INTERVIEWER: One time, I bought\na whole lot of the item [STR_VAR_2].\cBut it turned out to be too many.\nI ended up regretting it...\cSince then, I only buy strictly what\nI absolutely need...\cOops!\cThere's no point talking about me!
CLERK: [STR_VAR_1] also bought the item\n[STR_VAR_2] in bulk, taking [STR_VAR_3].\cINTERVIEWER: Oh, that's smart.\n[STR_VAR_2]'s a very good item, too.
CLERK: And, the TRAINER also bought\n[STR_VAR_3] of the item [STR_VAR_2].
CLERK: Plus, it was during a big sale.\nThat's smart shopping.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm... [STR_VAR_1] sounds like\nquite the shrewd bargain hunter!\cIn total, [STR_VAR_1]'s purchases came to...\c$[STR_VAR_2]?!\nWhat an amazing sum!\cOops! We're out of time!\nSee you on our next broadcast!
CLERK: [STR_VAR_1] is a VIP customer,\nno doubt about it.
Let's interview the clerk to get the\nlowdown.\cHi, how's your business?\cCLERK: Oh, we're doing unbelievable\nbusiness. It's almost overwhelming.\cRecently, a TRAINER named [STR_VAR_1]\nbought the item [STR_VAR_2]in bulk.\cThe TRAINER almost cleared out our\nentire stock of [STR_VAR_2]S.\cI never dreamt that any customer\nwould ever need so many [STR_VAR_2]S.\rIt's just unheard of!\cINTERVIEWER: So that would be like 100\nor 200 sold?\cCLERK: Oh, no, much more than that!\cINTERVIEWER: Oh, my goodness!\n[STR_VAR_1] must be a special shopper!\cCLERK: [STR_VAR_1] is a VIP customer,\nno doubt about it.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm...\nThat is amazing.\cBut why would the TRAINER need to buy\nso many?\c... ...\cThe mystery deepens, but this is all\nthe time we have today.\rSee you on our next broadcast!\cStill, [STR_VAR_1] is certainly an enigma...
THE WORLD OF MASTERS\cHello, viewers.\cPerhaps you are aware of a TRAINER\nnamed [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_1] is famous as a master at\ncatching POKéMON.\c[STR_VAR_1]'s quest for POKéMON depends\nentirely on a careful search on foot.\cOn one memorable day, the TRAINER\nwalked some [STR_VAR_2] steps.\cThe total number of POKéMON caught\nthat day reached an impressive [STR_VAR_3]!
That remarkable feat must have been\npossible because of the trust between\rthe TRAINER and [STR_VAR_1].
The master caught the day's last\n[STR_VAR_3] near [STR_VAR_2].\cThat POKéMON apparently enjoys\na special status as a record holder.\cSkilled TRAINERS should be encouraged\nto challenge this fine record.\cThat's all for today.\nPlease tune in next time.
GABBY: Oh! We've just spotted a tough-\nlooking TRAINER here of all places!\cOkay, roll camera!\nLet's get this interview.
GABBY: Oh! You're [PLAYER]! Hi!\nDo you remember us from last time?\cCan you show us how much stronger\nyou've become? Okay, cue interview!
GABBY: My eyes didn't lie!\nI did discover an astonishing TRAINER!
GABBY: Awesome! Awesome!\nWho are you?!\cI knew we were onto something wild\nwhen we spotted you!\cOh, please let me explain. We travel\naround everywhere interviewing all\rsorts of TRAINERS.\cSo, would you give us a bit of your time\nfor an interview?
GABBY: “[STR_VAR_1]!”\cDo you remember? That's the quote you\ngave us as the battle clincher last time.\cI never, ever forget stuff like that!
The last time we battled, you stomped\nus before we could brace ourselves...\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, didn't you\nthrow a POKé BALL at us?\cWe were shocked! So we told everyone,\njust everyone, about it!\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, your item\nskills cleverly did us in.\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, we managed\nto look respectable.\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
Anyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
You will?\nThank you!\cOkay, I need you to describe your\nfeelings about our battle, but it\rhas to be short and sweet. Go!
GABBY: Mmm, yeah!\nThat's the perfect clincher!\cI get the feeling that this will make\na great TV show.\cThere's a chance that they'll air this\non TV, so make sure to look for us!\cOkay!\nWe'll be seeing you!
GABBY: Oh...\cOkay, but don't give up!\nWe'll be keeping an eye out for you!
GABBY: We'll be keeping an eye out\nfor you!
GABBY: Is there a strong TRAINER\nanywhere with a lot of POKéMON?
GABBY: Wow, you are something!\cYou've gotten a lot stronger - a lot -\nsince we last battled.\cWe were right about you when we\nspotted you as a hot TRAINER.\cSo, anyway, what do you think?\nAre you willing to give us an interview\rthis time?
GABBY: That was an intense battle!\nDid you get all that on camera?
TY: Hey, lookie here! A tough-looking\nTRAINER here, of all places!\rCamera's rolling!
TY: Hey, lookie here!\nI remember you!\cI'll get this battle all on this\nhere camera!
TY: You're a natural!\nGot me some prime footage right here!
TY: Do you only have the one POKéMON\nand that's it?\cIf you had more POKéMON, it'd make for\nbetter footage, but...
TY: Yep, we sure spotted a hot TRAINER.\nThis is a huge scoop for us!
TY: Yep, I got it all.\nThat whole battle's on camera.
IN SEARCH OF TRAINERS...\cGABBY: Hi! Today I'm visiting an area\nnear [STR_VAR_1].\cWe're trying to spot some up-and-coming\nnew talent in the field.\cToday, we turned our lens on the\nTRAINER [PLAYER].\cThere's something about this TRAINER\nthat piqued our interest.
We've battled [PLAYER] before, but we\ncan attest that the TRAINER has most\rdefinitely improved from before.\cI knew we were onto someone special\nwhen we spotted this TRAINER!
The best way to determine how strong\na TRAINER is...\cWell, the fastest way is to battle.\nAnd so we began our investigation!\c... ...\cThat's how we ended up in battle\nwith [PLAYER].\cIn a dominating performance, we were\nflattened, rolled up, and tossed aside!\c[PLAYER] is ruthlessly strong...\cWe asked the TRAINER for a succinct\nsummation of the battle we shared.
The combination of [STR_VAR_1] and\n[STR_VAR_3] was divine!\cThe sight of them - [STR_VAR_1] and\n[STR_VAR_3] - selflessly supporting\reach other in the thick of battle...\cIt was a marvelous sight to behold!\c[STR_VAR_2] was the move the TRAINER\nused last in our battle.\cThe move [STR_VAR_2] is [STR_VAR_1]\nand [STR_VAR_3]'s sign of friendship!
...I lost confidence in myself as\na result of our encounter.\cWe were beaten before we could launch\na single attack.\rOhhh... Snivel...\cIn spite of that, [PLAYER]'s battles\nare worth seeing.\cI recommend confident TRAINERS to\nchallenge [PLAYER].
There's only one thing to be said.\nDon't you dare throw a POKé BALL during\ra TRAINER battle!\c[PLAYER] is certainly strong, but has\nno clue about the basic rules.\cTo our TV audience, I have a request.\cIf you see [PLAYER], please caution\nthe TRAINER!
[PLAYER] is adept at reading the\nopponent's actions.\cThe timing of item usage was remarkably\neffective!
Honestly speaking, I thought that\nI might even be pretty good.\cWhile we did end up losing, we did have\na hotly contested battle.\cBut if you're struggling against me,\nyou have a ways to go, [PLAYER]!
After our battle, we asked [PLAYER] for\na succinct summary.\cThe TRAINER replied, “[STR_VAR_1].”\c[PLAYER]'s POKéMON [STR_VAR_2] and\n[STR_VAR_3]...\rAnd “[STR_VAR_1]”...\cMmm! That's deep!

That should have happened.\nThat is why we awakened KYOGRE,\rto realize TEAM AQUA's vision of\rexpanding the sea.\cWhat?!\cIt's raining far harder than we\nenvisioned? You're in danger?\cThat can't be...\nThat's just not possible...\cHold your position and monitor the\nsituation!
ARCHIE: There's something wrong...\cThe RED ORB is supposed to awaken\nand control KYOGRE...\cBut... Why?\nWhy did KYOGRE disappear?\cWhy?!
MAXIE: What have you wrought?\cARCHIE... You've finally awoken KYOGRE,\nhaven't you?\cWhat will happen to the world if this\ndownpour continues for all eternity?\cThe world's landmass will drown in\nthe deepening sea...
ARCHIE: What are you saying?\cThe RED ORB should let me control\nKYOGRE...\rThat can't be possible...
MAXIE: We don't have the time to\nargue about it here!\cGet outside and see for yourself!\cSee if what you've wrought is the\nworld that you desired!
MAXIE: [PLAYER][KUN], come on, you have\nto get out of here, too!
MAXIE: Hold it right there.
MAXIE: Fufufu...\nSo it was you, after all.
MAXIE: Behold!\cSee how beautiful it is, the sleeping\nform of the ancient POKéMON GROUDON!\cI have waited so long for this day to\ncome...
MAXIE: It surprises me, how you've\nmanaged to chase me here.\cBut that's all over now.\cFor the realization of my dream,\nyou must disappear now!
I...\nI lost again?
MAXIE: Fufufu...\cI commend you. I must recognize that\nyou are truly gifted.\cBut!\nI have this in my possession!\cWith this BLUE ORB, I can make\nGROUDON...
The BLUE ORB suddenly began shining\nby itself!
MAXIE: What?!\cI didn't do anything.\nWhy did the BLUE ORB...\cWhere did GROUDON go?
MAXIE: Hm? It's a message from our\nmembers outside...
MAXIE: Yes, what is it?\cHm...\nThe sun is burning brightly?\cGood... That should have happened.\nThat is why we awakened GROUDON,\rto realize TEAM MAGMA's vision of\rexpanding the world's landmass.\cWhat?!\cIt's far hotter than we envisioned?\nIt's so hot that it's dangerous?\cThat can't be...\nThat's just not possible...\cHold your position and monitor the\nsituation!
MAXIE: There's something wrong...\cThe BLUE ORB is supposed to awaken\nand control GROUDON...\cBut... Why?\nWhy did GROUDON disappear?\cWhy?!
ARCHIE: What have you wrought?\cMAXIE... You've finally awoken GROUDON,\nhaven't you?\cWhat will happen to the world if this\nsunshine continues for all eternity?\cThe world's seas will all dry up and\ndisappear...
MAXIE: What are you saying?\cThe BLUE ORB should let me control\nGROUDON...\rThat can't be possible...
ARCHIE: We don't have the time to\nargue about it here!\cGet outside and see for yourself!\cSee if what you've wrought is the\nworld that you desired!
ARCHIE: [PLAYER][KUN], come on, you have\nto get out of here, too!
[PLAYER]'s BLUE ORB suddenly began\nglowing!
KYOGRE appears to have settled\ninto sleep again...
ARCHIE: This...
ARCHIE: ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThis is good-bye.\nThis is the last you've seen of me...
[PLAYER]'s RED ORB suddenly began\nglowing!
GROUDON appears to have settled\ninto sleep again...
MAXIE: This...
MAXIE: ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThis is good-bye.\nThis is the last you've seen of me...
I'll show you exactly how scary\nTEAM AQUA can be!
So you think you can stand up alone\nto TEAM AQUA's might...
Yeah, so you are strong...\nBut there're a lot of us!
What's up with you?\nWhat does a single kid expect to do?
Dang...\nToo strong...
You don't know anything.\nQuit messing around with us!
Hey, I remember you from MT. CHIMNEY!\nIt's payback time!
Urgggh...\nBeaten by some kid again!
Heh, it doesn't matter!\nWe bought ourselves some time!\cThe BOSS should have snatched what\nhe was after!
ARCHIE: Not you again...\cYou've impeded our plans repeatedly,\nbut this time you're too late.\cThe RED ORB that rested atop\nMT. PYRE...\rI, ARCHIE, claim it as mine!\cFufufu... Finally, I can realize my\ngrand design...\cCome on, crew!\nIt's SLATEPORT next!
Oh, no...\nThis cannot happen...\cHow could they take the RED ORB?\cThe BLUE ORB and RED ORB must never\nbe separated. They belong together.\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nHmm...\cFine!\nYou take the remaining BLUE ORB.\cPlease take after that foul man and\nget the other ORB back!
The BLUE ORB you have been entrusted\nwith and the stolen RED ORB...\cThey must never be apart...\nSomething terrible will happen...
So...\nKYOGRE has awoken...\cThe wondrous ORB that is said to have\nbecalmed the raging KYOGRE...\rIt is the BLUE ORB you bear.\cThat BLUE ORB was found buried inside\nthe CAVE OF ORIGIN in SOOTOPOLIS...\cThere is perhaps a link between\nKYOGRE and the CAVE OF ORIGIN...
That man, he returned the RED ORB.\cAre you going to return the BLUE ORB\nto its rightful place, too?
What's that?!\cIf the balance is not restored, there\nis no telling what could happen.\cYou will return the BLUE ORB to its\nrightful place, yes?
[PLAYER] handed the BLUE ORB to the\nold woman.
Yes...\nThe two ORBS should remain here.\cIt is how it should be for the good\nof all HOENN...
The spirit of the sea...\cThat is what KYOGRE is said to be in\nPOKéMON form...\cIn the same manner that we and POKéMON\nhave life, the sea is alive...\cKYOGRE has taught us that...
MT. PYRE is where we calm the spirits\nof POKéMON that have passed on...\cThis is a high place where one can\nsee all of HOENN...\cThe disembodied spirits of POKéMON\nmust find solace here...\cIs it coincidence that you are here...\cWill you hear out my tale? A tale long\ntold in the HOENN region?
It happened long, long ago...\cThe world was wracked by a ferocious\nclash between the POKéMON of the sea\rand the POKéMON of the land...\cThe POKéMON of the sea raised huge\nwaves and carved out oceans...\cThe POKéMON of the land raised\nmountains and created continents...\cTheir fierce duel raged without end.\cThe world was engulfed in massive\ninfernos and vicious storms.\cThe BLUE ORB and the RED ORB brought\nan end to the calamity.\cLight poured from the two ORBS and\nbecalmed the enraged adversaries.\cThe pair, made docile, dove deep into\nthe sea where eventually they\rdisappeared...
I see...\nWell, that, too, is fine...
ARCHIE: You...\nSo you stopped KYOGRE...\cI shouldn't be surprised...\cI understand now that humans cannot\nfreely control the balance between\rthe land and the sea...\cSo I have come to return the\nRED ORB...\cI doubt that we will cross paths again...\nFarewell...
I'll show you exactly how scary\nTEAM MAGMA can be!
So you think you can stand up alone\nto TEAM MAGMA's might...
Yeah, so you are strong...\nBut there're a lot of us!

Oh? Did you want to make some [POKEBLOCK]S\nwith this old-timer?
Excellent!
Oh...\nYou've made this old-timer sad...
Do you know how to make a [POKEBLOCK]?
Let's get started, then!\cLet's BERRY BLENDER!
Okay, a little explanation, then.\cOh, don't worry, it's quite simple.\cWhen the BLENDER's arrow comes to\nyour marker, just press the A Button.\cThat's all you have to do.\nYou'll see how easy it is when you try.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any [POKEBLOCK]S.
Well, that won't do at all now, will it?\cIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.\cThat way, we could make some [POKEBLOCK]S\ntogether using the BERRY BLENDER.
If I had some BERRIES left over,\nI'd gladly give you one...\cBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nWe'll have to do this another time.
But your [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full.\cYou should use some [POKEBLOCK]S before\nyou come see me again.
But you don't have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYou should get a [POKEBLOCK] CASE and then\ncome see me.
Let's get blending already!
I wonder what kind of [POKEBLOCK] I'll get?\nThis is so exciting!
[POKEBLOCK]S will be made with your friends \nfrom BERRIES in the BERRY BLENDER.\cIs it okay to save the game before\nlinking with your friends?
Searching for your friends...\n... ... B Button: Cancel
[STR_VAR_1] arrived.
[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2] arrived.
[STR_VAR_1], [STR_VAR_2], and\n[STR_VAR_3] arrived.
Nobody came...
You have no BERRIES.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
Your [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
You don't have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
I love making [POKEBLOCK]S.\cI always have some BERRIES with me.
If you'd like, we could make some\n[POKEBLOCK]S together using the\rBERRY BLENDER.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cWell, that won't do at all now, will it?\cIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.
We'll use it to make [POKEBLOCK]S together\nusing the BERRY BLENDER.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cIf I had some left over, I'd gladly\ngive you one...\cBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nSorry about that.
If you have POKéMON with you, then\nyou're an official POKéMON TRAINER!\rYou can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...\nI should have trained mine more...
Listen, you. If you're strong, you\nshould have told me before!
Ever since I lost to you, I desperately\ntrained my POKéMON.\rYou can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...\nIs my training method not right?
If you're going to get stronger, I'll\nget stronger, too.
Did you just become a TRAINER?\nWe're both beginners!
I called you because I thought I\ncould beat you...
I haven't won once yet...\nI wish I would win soon...
Hahah! Our eyes met!\nI'll take you on with my BUG POKéMON!
Ow! Down and out!
If you lock eyes with a TRAINER,\nyou have to challenge! It's a rule!
I'm going to keep winning and aim\nto be the best TRAINER.\cHelp me further my career!
I ended up furthering your career...
To keep winning my way up, I see that\nI have to catch more POKéMON.
Did you feel the tug of our soul-\nsoothing fragrance?
You weren't led astray by our aroma...
Aromatherapy is a form of mental\nhealing that works with fragrances.
AMY: I'm AMY.\nAnd this is my little sister LIV.\rWe battle together!
AMY: Uh-oh, we lost.
AMY: You have to think about all\nkinds of things when you're battling\ragainst two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one\nPOKéMON with you.\rYou can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one\nteam.
LIV: Oh, we lost, big sister...
LIV: We work perfectly together, me\nand my big sister...\cBut we still lost...
LIV: If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two POKéMON!\rIt's not fair if you don't!
AMY: I'm AMY.\nAnd this is my little sister LIV.\rWe battle together!
AMY: Aww, boo!\nWe couldn't win again...
AMY: You have to think about all\nkinds of things when you're battling\ragainst two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one\nPOKéMON with you.\rYou can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one\nteam.
LIV: Awww, we lost again...\nBig sister...
LIV: We work perfectly together, me\nand my big sister...\cBut why did we lose again?
LIV: If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two POKéMON!\rIt's not fair if you don't!
Gah! My fishing line's all snarled up!\nI'm getting frustrated and mean!\rThat's it! Battle me!
Gah! Lost it!\nI'm even more annoyed now!
Gah, I'm still boiling mad...\nGrrrrr...
My POKéMON is delightfully adorable!\nDon't be shy - I'll show you!
Oh, my gosh!\nMy darling POKéMON!
My delightful POKéMON looks darling\neven when it's fainted!
Hi, you! My delightfully adorable\nPOKéMON has become more darling!
Oh!\nMy darling POKéMON!
The more I spend time with it, the\nmore adorable my POKéMON becomes.
GINA: Okay, let's battle with our\nPOKéMON!
GINA: Losing upsets me!
GINA: [STR_VAR_1] is strong!\nWe have to train lots more!
GINA: Oh? Only one POKéMON?\nThen, we don't battle with you.\cIf there's only one POKéMON, it will\nbe lonesome. That's not nice.
MIA: We are twins, so we battle\nPOKéMON together.
MIA: We battled together, but we\nboth lost...
MIA: We will train our POKéMON more\nand be strong like you.
MIA: You want to battle with us?\cIt's a big no-no if you don't have two\nPOKéMON with you.\rWe're too strong for you!
Why keep it a secret?\nI'm the WATER POKéMON expert!\cHuh?\nYou don't know me?
I thought I wasn't too bad, if I may\nsay so, but I guess not... Bleah...
I got too into fishing.\nI forgot I had to raise my POKéMON...
Leaving footprints in the sand is\nso fun!
Waah! I got sand in my runners!\nThey're all gritty!
I want to leave my footprints in the\nsand everywhere, but they disappear\rquickly...
Should I...\nOr shouldn't I?\cOkay, sure, I will battle!
I shouldn't have battled...
If you're faced with a decision and\nyou let someone else choose for you,\ryou will regret it, however things\rturn out.
Come on, battle with me!
Ohh...\nI thought I could win...
I made the decision to battle, so I\ncan accept this loss in grace.\cI am still upset about losing!
Oh, sure, I'll accept your challenge.\nI have a lot of money.
Why couldn't I win?
There are some things money can't buy.\nThat's POKéMON...
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch\nof things about POKéMON.
I lost again?\nWhy couldn't I win?
I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't\nseem to win at POKéMON...\cIt's so deep, the world of POKéMON...
We must have been fated to meet.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my!
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
Hello, we meet again.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my...\nI did the best that I could...
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
There's supposed to be a mystical\nrock around here.\rDo you know anything about it?
I was thinking too much about that\nrock, while my POKéMON remained weak...
I can spend hours and hours staring\nat a nice rock without growing bored.
Whew! I was worried that a kid was\ndrowning when I saw you.\cYou seem to be okay, so what do you\nsay to a battle?
Glub... Glub...
If you are drowning, the signal is to\nwave one arm toward the beach.
Swimming the deep blue sea...\nIt feels the greatest!
I lost...\nNow I'm feeling blue...
Why is the sea blue?\cI learned about that at the MUSEUM in\nSLATEPORT, but I forgot.
My body feels lighter in the water.\nIt's as if I've gotten slimmer!
I'm floating...
Your body weight is reduced to just\none tenth in the water.\cThat would make me...\nWhoops! I'm not telling you my weight!
The blue, blue sky...\nThe vast sea...\rIt's so peaceful...
I lost while I was lounging!
I want to be told I'm relaxing to be\nwith. Giggle.
Which do you prefer, fishing in the\nsea or a stream?
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost\nspectacularly!
Fishing is the greatest whether it's\nin the sea or a stream.\rYou agree with me, right?
I caught a bunch of POKéMON fishing.\nI'll show you an impressive battle!
I lost again spectacularly!
Win or lose, POKéMON are the greatest!\nYou agree with me, right?
What do people do if they need to go\nto a washroom?\cWhat if my ROD hooks a big one while\nI'm in the washroom? I just can't go...
I lost because I'm trying to not go\nto the washroom...
Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook\na big one!
Hahahah! I'm a lousy runner, but in\nthe water you can't catch me!
I give up!
I wouldn't lose in a swim race...
The sea is my backyard. I'm not going\nto take it easy because you're a kid!
Did you take it easy on me by any\nchance?
Drifting along with the waves...\nI love it! Why don't you give it a try?
Yawn...\cI must have drifted off to sleep while\nI was drifting in the waves.
Ahaha, I lost...\nI'll take a snooze, I think...
Floating and being rocked by the\nwaves - it's like sleeping in a plush,\rcomfy bed.
The sea is like my backyard.\nLet's battle!
I lost on my home field...\nI'm in shock!
I swim the seas with a heart full of\ndreams...\cIt's a song!\nAnyways, I'm swimming some more.
Swimming in the big, wide sea, my\nPOKéMON has grown stronger!
What a shock!\cMy POKéMON has gotten stronger, but\nI stayed weak as a TRAINER!
What you learn in battle makes you a\nstronger TRAINER.\rThe waves taught me that.
Do you know a little town called\nDEWFORD?
I hate this!
A weird saying is getting really\ntrendy at DEWFORD HALL.
Did you want to battle me?\nSure, I'll go with you!
I wasn't good enough for you.
I think you're going to keep getting\nbetter. I'll go for it, too!
LISA: We challenge you as a sister\nand brother!
LISA: Awesome.\nYou're in a different class of tough.
LISA: Do you have any friends who\nwould go to the beach with you?
LISA: If you want to battle with us,\nbring more POKéMON.
RAY: We always battle POKéMON, me\nand my sister.\cI always lose, but we can beat you\n2-on-2!
RAY: Wowee, you're at a higher level\nthan us!
RAY: My sister gave me my POKéMON.\nI raised it, and now it's my important\rpartner!
RAY: If you want to battle us, go\nbring some more POKéMON!
My dream is to swim the world's seven\nseas!
I won't be able to swim the seven seas\nlike this...
Playing with marine POKéMON is one of\nthe pleasures of swimming!
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to the\nABANDONED SHIP, too?
I'm sinking!\nGlub... Glub...
Some people even go inside that\nABANDONED SHIP.
My liar of a boyfriend told me that\nI look great in a bikini...
Oh, boo!
Even if it's a lie, I love being told\nI look great...\rWe girls are so complex...
I love the sea!\nI forget all my worries when I swim!
When I lose a battle, I get all\nstressed out!
Work off your stress by swimming!\nIt's so healthy!
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!\nThis is what you call “cut”!
Aiyah!\nFlubbed out!
Hiyah!\cMy sculpted abs have nothing to do\nwith POKéMON battles!
Are you properly protected against\nthe sun?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Cheeks are the most prone to burning!
I've laid anchor in ports around the\nworld, but SLATEPORT's the best.
You're the best!
In the best port was the best\nTRAINER...
Urrrrppp...\nBattle? With me?
Urp... Ooooooohhhhhh...\nUrrrrpppp...
I'm usually stronger than this!\nI'm just seasick as a dog!\cI'm a SAILOR, but...
I'm thirsty... I could go for a SODA POP\nat the SEASHORE HOUSE...
Groan...
I'm getting famished... My inner tube\nlooks like a giant doughnut...
I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in\nme for a battle!
I lost...\nIt's because I'm hungry...
When you eat on a beach, everything\nseems to taste a little better.
Doesn't a beach umbrella look like\na giant flower?
Mommy!
If you look at the beach from the sky,\nit looks like a big flower garden!
I'm not losing to you again!\nThat's why I have my inner tube!
Mommy!
If I have an inner tube, me and my\nPOKéMON's cuteness goes way up!
I can't swim without my inner tube,\nbut I won't lose at POKéMON!
Did I lose because I have an inner\ntube?
My inner tube is a fashion item.\nI can't be seen without it.
Hi, big TRAINER.\nWill you battle with me?
Oh, you're strong.
How did you get to be so strong?
Wahahah! This dude's going to catch\nhimself a big one!
This dude just lost one...
This dude thinks you're a big one.\nNo, you're a big-one-to-be!
PAUL: Well, this is a mood-breaker.\cI wish you wouldn't disturb our\nprecious time together.
PAUL: Well, I give up.
PAUL: Well, don't tell anyone that\nwe're here.\rThis is just our private world of two!
PAUL: We're totally, deeply in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON battle\rtogether.
MEL: We're, like, totally in love.\nOur romance is heating up all of HOENN!
MEL: We lost, and it's my fault!\nPAUL will hate me!
MEL: Um, PAUL, are you angry with me?\nPlease don't be angry.
MEL: We're, like, deeply and truly in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON\rbattle together.
Whoa! Watch it!\nI guess you're not used to BIKE racing.
Whoa!\nMy brakes failed!
Flat tires and brake problems can\ncause serious injury!\rInspect your BIKE for problems!
Yo, you!\nCan you keep up with my speed?
Crash and burn!
Speed alone won't let me win at POKéMON.\nI need to reconsider this...
Don't panic if your BIKE's going fast!
I shouldn't panic during POKéMON\nbattles...
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.
Aren't you going a little too fast?\nTake it easy and let's battle.
I didn't panic, but I still lost...
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.
The triathlon is hard in the extreme.\cYou have to complete the three events\nof swimming, cycling, and running.
POKéMON battles are hard, too!
I'm exhausted, so I need a break.\nIt's important to get proper rest.
Isn't it neat to hold a battle while\ncycling?
Wow...\nHow could you be so strong?
Were you going after a record?\cI'm sorry if I held you up!
I've been riding without stopping.\nMy thighs are like rocks!
I'm worried about muscle cramps...
Oh, you have some GYM BADGES?\nNo wonder you're so strong!
I have foreseen your intentions!\nI cannot possibly lose!
I failed to prophesize my own demise!
I see your future...\cHmm...\nI see a shining light...
Ahahahaha!\nI'll dazzle you with my wonders!
I wondrously lost!
You managed to win only because it was\na wonder! Yes, a wonder!\rDon't think you can win all the time!
Could I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?
I wanted to complete my\ncollection...
When I see a POKéMON that I don't know,\nmy passion as a collector is ignited!
Hi, have you caught any new POKéMON?\cCould I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?
Your POKéMON...\nI envy you.
Oh, I long to make all rare POKéMON\nmine!
Hey!\nDon't sneak up behind me like that!
I lost!\nDrat!
Fishing is all about concentration.\nYou have to focus on the floater.
Ahahaha! I would go anywhere to show\noff my delightful POKéMON.
Oh, dear, this won't do.
Perhaps I should groom my POKéMON for\nCONTESTS rather than battles.
Ahahahaha! I would be happy to show\noff my POKéMON as often as you like!
Oh, dear, this won't do.
CONTESTS are delightful, but I like\nto battle, too.
I found some cool POKéMON in the grass\naround here!
Being cool isn't enough to win...
It's hard to battle with POKéMON you\njust caught.
Oh, hey! Those GO-GOGGLES suit you.\nBut I think they look better on me.\cLet's decide who they look better on\nwith a battle!
I couldn't see what was happening at my\nsides because of the GO-GOGGLES.
The GO-GOGGLES make it possible to\nget through sandstorms.\rThat makes me happy!
I'm having a picnic in the desert.\cYou can always find a TRAINER, so\nI can enjoy a battle here, too!
Ohhh! You're mean!
When you're battling in a sandstorm,\nwatch out for your POKéMON's HP.\cIt can faint if you don't keep an eye\non it!
Wearing these GO-GOGGLES makes me\nfeel like a superhero.\rRight now, nobody can beat me!
I can't win on spirit alone...
I'm going to be a real hero one day.\nI'm going to work harder to make me\rand my POKéMON stronger.
I heard there are fossils to be found\nin the desert. Where could they be?
I came up short...
If they can find fossils in the desert,\nit must have been a sea before.
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\rI am to be challenged?
While I have searched for ruins, I've\nnot searched for strong POKéMON.
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years?\nWhich was it now?
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years?\nAnyway, am I to be challenged?
I've found no ruins, nor have I found\nany strong POKéMON...
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years I've\nsearched?\cHmm... It could even be fifty...\nHow long have I been at this?
I'm full of pep!\nAnd my POKéMON is peppy, too!
My POKéMON lost its pep...
When I see a TRAINER with a lot of pep,\nI can't help looking.
I don't know where you're going, but\nwould you like to battle?
Oh, you're disgustingly good!
I'm thinking that I should go to\nMT. CHIMNEY, but the view around\rhere is very nice, too.
To train myself, I challenge all\nwhom I meet!
Uncle! I give up!
All I can do is keep training until\nI can defeat strong TRAINERS such\ras yourself.
Show me how much you've toughened\nyour POKéMON.
I see, you've toughened them\nconsiderably.
POKéMON and TRAINERS learn much\nthrough battling.\cWhat's important is to never give up\neven if you lose.
We're training here to elevate our\ngame to the next level.\rStay and train with us!
Ooh, you're decent!
Since you're that strong, you should\naim for the POKéMON LEAGUE.
Oh, your POKéMON look like serious\nactors.\rI have to ask you for an engagement.
They didn't just look strong, they\nare strong!
I thought I was raising my POKéMON\ndiligently, but, oh no, there is still\rmuch to be done.
You can make POKéMON stronger or\nweaker depending on the moves you\rteach them.\cWhat kinds of moves do your POKéMON\nknow?
You've taught them good moves!
Maybe I should have stopped my\nPOKéMON from evolving until they\rlearned better moves...
Hahahaha!\nHow about we have a battle?\rYou and me!\rHahahaha!
I lost!\nHahahaha!
Hahahahaha! Something flew up my nose!\nHahahaha-hatchoo!
My legs are solid from pounding up\nand down the mountains.\cThey're not going to buckle easily,\nfriend!
Ouch! My legs cramped up!
Try hiking, and I mean really\npounding, on these mountain trails\rwith a heavy pack weighing dozens of\rpounds.\cThat, my friend, will get your body\ninto serious shape.
I've been keeping fit by hiking.\nPower, I have in spades!
I got trumped in power?
I hear there are some seriously tough\nTRAINERS on top of MT. CHIMNEY.\cI intend to get up there and give them\na challenge!
I'm strong.\nI won't cry if I lose.
Waaaah!
I'm not crying because I miss my mommy!\nSnivel...
When you're out on a picnic, why, you\nsimply have to sing!\rCome on, sing with me!
Oh, you're so strong!
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad\nat singing or POKéMON.\cIf you have the most fun, you win!
Can you guess why it's so cool\naround here?
Peeuuw!\nThat stinks!
The volcanic ash blocks the sun, so it\ndoesn't get very warm.\cThat's good for me - I can't stand heat!
The volcano's eruption is proof that\nthe earth is alive.
You're some kind of strong!
Ouch! Owww! I can't see!\nI got ashes in my eyelashes!\cGet it? Ashes and eyelashes?\cOkay, that was bad, sorry...
I use this parasol to ward off this\nfilthy, yucky volcanic ash from my\rdear NUMEL.
Huff, huff...\nI am exhausted...
You're very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!
Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while?\nMay I invite you to battle?
Oh, how super!
You've remained very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
I must refine the art of concealment.\nI bid thee farewell.
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
My flawless concealment was let down\nby my immature battle skills...\cI bid thee farewell.
Thanks for finding me!\nBut we still have to battle!
I'll use my ninjutsu on you...\n“VOLCANIC ASH SWIRL CLOAK”!\c...What? It's already over?
You know what's crummy about hiding?\nIt's lonely if no one comes along.
TORI: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.
TORI: We lost... It's boring, so I'm going\nto get some more ashes.
TORI: How much ash do we have?\nEnough for a WHITE FLUTE, I hope.
TORI: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we didn't, we would lose!
TIA: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.
TIA: We couldn't win... It's boring,\nso I'm getting some more ashes.
TIA: We have a lot of ashes!\nI think enough for a WHITE FLUTE!
TIA: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we don't, we won't win!
Yodelayhihoo!\c... ...\cYou're supposed to shout\n“yodelayhihoo” since it doesn't\recho here!
Yodelayhihoo!
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there\nwas someone copying me and shouting\rback, “Yodelayhihoo.”
If you're not prepared, you shouldn't\nbe up in the mountains!
The mountains are unforgiving...
In the winter, mountains turn deadly\nwith blizzards and avalanches.
Camping's fun! You can fish, roast\nmarshmallows, and tell spooky stories!\cBut the best of all are the POKéMON\nbattles!
Way too strong!
I think it's great that I can go\ncamping with my POKéMON.
I need to exercise after a meal.\nLet's have a match!
Oh, no!
I just had a tasty meal.\nI'm getting drowsy...
Ufufufufufu...\nWant to battle against my POKéMON?
M-My POKéMON...
A big body that's all lumpy and hard,\nenormous horns, and vicious fangs...\cUfufufufu...\nI wish I had a POKéMON like that...
Ufufufufufu...\nCome on, battle my POKéMON...
I feel so lucky getting to see your\nPOKéMON...
Ufufufufufu...\cWhen I see POKéMON battling, I get all\nshivery and shaky...
If you're lighting a campfire, make\nsure you have water handy.
Thanks for dousing my fire!
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\cDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
Have you learned to keep water handy\nfor campfires?
I got hosed down before I could flare\nup, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\cDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand\na chance against me.\rSo, bring on your POKéMON!
If we were fishing, I would've won...
I think I'll try my luck at landing\na big one at METEOR FALLS.\cThere has to be something in there.\nI just know it.
I like to fish. But I also like to\nbattle!\cIf anyone challenges me, I'm there,\neven if I'm fishing.
I like to battle, but that doesn't\nmean I'm good at it...
This time I'll do it!\cI always think that, so I can't walk\naway from fishing or POKéMON.
TYRA: Well, sure.\nI'm in the mood for it.\rI'll teach you a little about POKéMON.
TYRA: What an amazing battle style!
TYRA: I was teaching my junior IVY\nabout POKéMON.
TYRA: Giggle...\nIf you want to battle with us, just one\rPOKéMON isn't enough!
IVY: Who taught you about POKéMON?
IVY: What an amazing battle style!
IVY: I started training POKéMON\nbecause TYRA, my student mentor,\rtaught me!
IVY: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nI think it must feel lonesome.
Hm...\nYou seem rather capable...\rLet me keep you company!
You're much stronger than\nI'd imagined!
There is no such thing as a born genius.\nIt all depends on effort!\rThat is what I believe...
Hm... As always, your agility speaks\nfor itself.\rCome, keep me company!
As strong as ever!
All it takes is effort!\cI lost because I haven't put in enough\neffort!
You!\cMy MACHOP!\cDemand a battle!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My MACHOP crew!\cSo long as they seek power, I will\ngrow strong with them!
My strongest skill is busting bricks\nwith my forehead!
Ugwaaaah!\nMy head is busted!
I've been teaching my POKéMON karate.\cIt looks like they'll get a lot better\nthan me. I'm excited about that.
After you beat me, we trained hard to\nimprove our skills.\rCome on, give us a rematch!
Ugwaaah!\nWe lost again!
My POKéMON will grow stronger!\nI'll redouble my training!
This beach is my secret training spot!\nDon't come butting in!
I haven't trained enough!
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce\nimpact and prevent injury.\rThis is the perfect place to train.
Okay, let's get this battle on!
I can battle but my POKéMON...
Even when I lose, I still get some\nenjoyment out of it.\rIt must be that I love POKéMON.
I have a rare POKéMON!\nWould you like me to show you?
You...\nYou want my POKéMON, don't you?
I have this rare POKéMON.\nIt's enough to keep me satisfied.
I have a rare POKéMON!\nWould you like me to show you?
You...\nYou want my POKéMON, don't you?
I have this rare POKéMON.\nIt's enough to keep me satisfied.
If the tunnel doesn't go through, then\nI'll just go over the top.
Gasp... Gasp...\nLosing made me tired...
It's no big deal if there's no tunnel.\nTo a HIKER, mountains are roads!
My POKéMON rule!\nCheck them out!
Ouch! A scrape!\nI have to put on a bandage!
Bandages are signs of toughness!\nI've got another one!
My BUG POKéMON are tough!\nLet's battle!
I lost!\nI thought I had you!
BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.\nSo they get strong quickly, too.
Let me teach you how strong my\nadorable POKéMON is!
You're a notch above me...
POKéMON that possess cuteness and\npower, that's ideal, I think.
We learn all sorts of things at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\cI want to test things out for real!
I slacked off in school...\nThat's why I lost.
I'll have to redo some courses at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I've been studying seriously at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rI won't lose like I did last time.
Hunh?\nI studied diligently.
I'll have to redo some courses at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I study at school, and I study on the\nway home, too!
I'm in shock - I lost?
Awww, I'll never become an elegant\nTRAINER like ROXANNE this way!
I studied a whole lot since I saw you.\nYou must see my achievements!
I'm in shock. I lost again?
You've beaten ROXANNE?\nI can't beat you, then. Not yet.
Listen, could I get you to battle the\nPOKéMON I'm raising?
You've raised yours superbly...
POKéMON isn't all about power.\cPolishing a unique aspect of one's\ncharacter is another way of enjoying\rPOKéMON.
The POKéMON I've been raising are\nlooking good, just like before.
You know how to raise them properly.\nYou might have DAY CARE skills...
Your POKéMON are growing good!\nYou should enter them in CONTESTS.
Please, allow me to evaluate if you\nhave raised your POKéMON properly.
Yes, they are growing properly.
If you feed [POKEBLOCK]S to POKéMON, the\nunique aspects of their character\rwill be enhanced.
Allow me to reevaluate if you have\nraised your POKéMON properly.
They are growing admirably.
POKéMON seem to like different kinds\nof [POKEBLOCK]S, depending on their nature.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nwhatever, let's have a battle!
I ran out of energy!
I may have blown it...\cI might have dropped to last during\nthat battle...
I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm comfortably ahead.\rLet's make this a quick battle!
I ran out of energy again!
I was tops in swimming and cycling, but\nI'm not quite that confident with\rPOKéMON yet.
I do my triathlon training with POKéMON,\nso I'm pretty confident about my speed.
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.
Training is meaningful only if you\nkeep it up regularly.\cOkay! I'll resume my training!\nTomorrow!
Are you keeping up with your training?\nI sure am!\rLet me show you the evidence!
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.
I'll resume training tomorrow.\nLet's battle again sometime!
Once a BUG CATCHER!\nAnd now a BUG MANIAC!\cBut my love for POKéMON remains\nunchanged!
My ineptitude also remains\nunchanged...
All I did was follow my heart, and now\nthey call me a BUG MANIAC...\cStill, I am an expert on BUG POKéMON,\nso it's only natural that they call me\ra BUG MANIAC.
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner. I have to do good!
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner! Let me win!
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\cI'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: If you want to battle us, bring\ntwo POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my super\nsenior student partner and beat you!
MEG: Oh, no!\nI'm sorry, ANNA! I let you down...
MEG: I dragged ANNA down...\nIf I didn't, she would have won!
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\cWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
ANNA: I can't keep losing in front of\nmy junior partner, right?
ANNA: I couldn't get into the groove.
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\cI'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: If you want to battle us, bring\ntwo POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my\nsenior partner and win this time!
MEG: Too strong!
MEG: I battled together with my\nsenior partner, but we lost...\cThat's so discouraging...
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\cWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
The aroma of flowers has a magical\npower. It cleanses us body and soul.
Oh, dear me.\nI seem to have lost.
Flowers, POKéMON...\nI love whatever smells nice.\cStinky things...\nI'll pass.
Were you drawn here by the sweet\naroma?
The power of aroma...\nIt didn't seem to do much.
If you use a sweet aroma properly,\nPOKéMON will be attracted by it.
BIRD POKéMON that FLY elegantly in\nthe sky... They're the best!
Urgh... I crashed...
You've got great POKéMON.\nI'll have to train mine better.
Take flight!\nMy BIRD POKéMON!
They did take flight...
If they'd get stronger, they'd be able\nto fly more freely...
I'm a FISHERMAN, but also a TRAINER.\nI'm raising the POKéMON I caught.
I thought I was doing okay in my\ntraining...
I couldn't win by training POKéMON\nwhile I fished...\cWas I doing things in half measures?
For FISHERMEN, equipment is the key.\cBut for TRAINERS, the key ingredients\nare POKéMON and heart, of course!
I was beaten in heart?
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle\nbetween a FISHERMAN and a POKéMON.
Let my melody rock your soul!
La-lalala...
An electric guitar doesn't always\nhave to be noisy...\cIt can be strummed to squeeze out\nthis heart-stirring melody...
A melody from my POKéMON and me...\nLet us deliver it to your soul.
La-lalala...
When I play, my emotions should reach\nyou through my electric guitar...
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nWe MIMIC what you do!
Whoopsie!\nI lost!
What's so good about mimicry?\cFufufu...\nYou'll never understand...
So, we finally meet!\nMy BUG POKéMON will keep you company!
I wish we'd never met...
I want to MIMIC you some more.\cCan you hurry up and move?
If you step forward, we step forward.\cIf you turn right, we turn, too...
But if you win, I lose...
I can't MIMIC you winning the match.\nThat's just impossible...\rIt's burning me up...
Yep, you've finally caught me!\nOr were you trying to avoid me?
Whoop, that was a great match!
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nI hope you enjoyed our performance.
You don't know who I am, do you?\cBut, I also don't know you.\nSo, we'll battle!
You're pretty strong!
Until you go away somewhere, we'll\nkeep on mimicking your every move.
The MIMIC CIRCLE was formed by people\nwho like to MIMIC.\cA battle starts the instant we meet!
I surrender!
Won't you join our MIMIC CIRCLE?
Who has the knowledge and the\ntechnique for survival?\cPOKéMON RANGERS, that's who!
I didn't have enough POKéMON\nknow-how...
To break away from civilization and\nawaken the wild spirit within!\cThat's our vision.
I'm going to regain my wild spirit by\nbeing together with POKéMON.
You've remained strong!
Believe in your POKéMON.\nBelieve in yourself.\cThe road will reveal itself to you.
Oh? Look at you.\cFor someone on an adventure, you're\ntraveling awfully light.
Accidents happen when you're not\nprepared!
You're traveling light but you have\neverything you need.\cYou're on top of things mentally and\nphysically, too.
How's your journey with POKéMON\ngoing?
I'm still missing something...
In the same way that you, as a TRAINER,\nrely on your POKéMON, your POKéMON\rrely on you.
The vast sky holds untold promise!\cNothing can compare to the sheer\nexhilaration of flight!
Down and out!
My BIRD POKéMON made my dreams of\nflying come true!
I'll show you the true potential of me\nand my BIRD POKéMON!
We lacked potential...
Ever since I was a little kid, I always\nadmired BIRD POKéMON...
To lurk in shadows, and live in\ndarkness... That is my destiny.\cI emerge to challenge you!
I admit defeat!
Those defeated in battle withdraw\nquietly back into the shadows.\rThat, too, is destiny...
If you're not on your guard, you're in\nfor some pain!
You're surprisingly good!
My surprise attack ended in\nfailure...
To hide a tree, use a forest!
I bow to your superiority.
To hide a tree, use a forest!\nTo hide a POKéMON, use a POKéMON!\cThere is no deep, hidden meaning\nto that.
You spoke to me...\nSo you want to challenge me!\cSure! I'll try out the POKéMON I caught\nwhile SURFING!
I don't have a clue about what it\ntakes to win.
Go for a SURF on my POKéMON...\cThen fish off its back...\cIt's an indescribably luxuriant moment!
Do you have any moves that can strike\na flying POKéMON?
You soared above me!
The move FLY is convenient, don't\nyou think?\cWhile the POKéMON is flying, almost\nno moves can strike it.
My POKéMON is strong!\nHow about yours?
Your POKéMON were stronger...
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
Your POKéMON are seriously strong.
My POKéMON are growing stronger.\nI have to grow stronger, too.
I'll check your POKéMON and see if\nthey're fit for the outdoors.
With POKéMON that strong, you're in\nno danger of needing rescue!
To travel wherever your heart desires\nwith POKéMON...\rThat's the joy of being a TRAINER.
How's your physical fitness?\nIf you're not fit, you could have a\rrough time in critical situations.
I'm totally fit, but...
Fitness training is in my routine.\nI always run with my POKéMON.
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\rWant to battle?
... ... ... ... ... ...\nI lost...
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\rI'll try harder...
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\rWant to battle again?
... ... ... ... ... ...\nI lost again...
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\rI'll try harder...\rFor my precious BUG POKéMON...
POKéMON have many special abilities.\nIf you want to become a first-class\rTRAINER, learn about them.
You're obviously thinking.
The special abilities of POKéMON\nwill make battle styles change.
Who might you be?\cAre you perhaps searching for ancient\nruins that are rumored to possibly\rexist according to legend?
What a disgraceful setback...
That giant rock... I would like to\nbelieve it may indeed contain ancient\rruins. But I see no entrance.
Why am I carrying this parasol?\cI'll tell you if you can win against me.
A parasol can't ward off POKéMON\nattacks...
I don't think strong sunlight is good\nfor my POKéMON.\rSo I shield them with my parasol.
Me, POKéMON, and my parasol...\cIf any one of them is missing, the\npicture of beauty will be ruined.
You've completely ruined my beauty...
A parasol wouldn't suit you at all.\cWhy, something like this would only\nget in your way.
I will adopt the movements of POKéMON\nand create new ninja techniques.
The creation of new ninja techniques\nis but a distant dream...
Perhaps I ought to apprentice under\na ninja sensei.
We ninja conceal ourselves under our\ncamouflage cloaks.\rI bet you didn't know where I was!
I lost!\nI should camouflage my shame!
Our camouflage cloaks are all\nhandmade.
Will you play with my delightfully\npretty POKéMON?
This isn't what I meant!
I'm going to a CONTEST in LILYCOVE.\cMy POKéMON should have no problem\nsweeping the MASTER CLASS.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled the\nworld's four corners.\cYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
I would like to circle the globe once\nagain with my POKéMON.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled the\nworld's four corners.\cYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
Your POKéMON and you...\cYour prowess together will be\nconsidered strong, even overseas.
There are powers beyond our\nunderstanding in the world...
I have lost...
MT. PYRE...\nThere is a mysterious power\rat work there...
KATE: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!
KATE: I blew it in front of my junior\nstudent partner...
KATE: When someone's relying on me,\nI get this urge to look cool in front\rof them...
KATE: If you've only got one POKéMON,\nwe can't battle with you.\cThat would be bullying.
JOY: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!
JOY: Please forgive me, KATE!
JOY: Ehehe, I'll have to train with KATE,\nmy senior student partner, again.
JOY: You need at least two POKéMON\nif you're going to challenge us!
Stop! Have a good look at my precious\nPOKéMON!
Oh, how dare you!\nDon't take it so seriously!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.
My precious POKéMON grew!\nHave a good look!
Oh, how dare you!\nYou still won't take it easy!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.
Want to determine how strong you are?\nI'll be the test!
You passed with flying colors!
To best even me...\nYour strength is marvelous!
You seem to have a big collection\nof GYM BADGES.\cLet me see if you're actually worthy of\nthose BADGES!
Oh, you're worthy, all right!
You did your BADGES proud in that\nmatch!
They say that good times are filled\nwith good aromas.
Oh...\nI smell the bitter scent of misery...
The BERRY MASTER's garden is filled\nwith uplifting fragrances.
Being a psychic is about willpower.\cI've willed myself not to lose to\nanyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
Being a psychic is about willpower.\nI thought I wouldn't lose to you...
I've convinced myself that I won't\nlose anymore. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
I should train at MT. PYRE...\nI'll never beat you this way...
Don't be too happy if your POKéMON\ndevelop psychic powers.\cYou need to refine those powers to\nmake them really useful.
Astounding!
We all have psychic powers.\nWe've just forgotten how to use them.
Have you awoken the psychic powers\nwithin you?
Astounding!
Your power with POKéMON...\nThat could be a psychic power, too.
MIU: Hello, TRAINER. I hope your\nPOKéMON won't cry when they lose.
MIU: Uh-oh, we lost.
MIU: TRAINER, your POKéMON are\nstrong because you are friends.
MIU: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.
YUKI: Okay!\nWe're beating the TRAINER's POKéMON!
YUKI: Uh-oh, we lost.
YUKI: Why are you so strong?\nWe've never lost before.
YUKI: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.
MT. PYRE...\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep...\rWill your POKéMON sleep?
Overflowing with vitality...
MT. PYRE...\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep...\cIt must overflow with a power that\nsoothes spirits...
Hey, are you lost at sea?\cIf you can beat my POKéMON, I can\nserve as your pilot.
I lost my bearings in battle!
Many people lose their bearings at sea.\cIf you're that sort, you should refer\nto the POKéNAV's MAP.
Hm! You're riding a POKéMON instead\nof swimming yourself...\cI am envious!
Oh!\nI can't...
I'm getting chilled...\nI've been in the water too long...\cI wish I could ride a POKéMON like you...
If you just float in the sea like\nthis, POKéMON come around to play.
Oh...\nLost at sea...
While swimming, I noticed that some\nPOKéMON attack, and some just watch.\cI guess POKéMON have personalities\nof their own.
If you just float in the sea like this,\nTRAINERS challenge you!
That's strange...\nI lost again...
This has nothing to do with anything,\nbut maybe I'll visit the TRICK HOUSE.
I'm growing bored of swimming...\nHow about a battle?
I had no idea that you were\nthis strong!
All the effort you put in must have\nmade you this strong.
Fufufufu... I dive deep underwater\nto go deep under cover.\rPlumbing the depths is where I excel!
Glub, glub, glub...\nI'm sinking...
I have it on good authority that\nthere's a DIVE spot around here.\cIt gives me the urge to go deep\nagain...
RITA: Sigh...\cHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\cLet's battle so I won't have to dwell\non that!
RITA: SAM! It's your fault we lost!\nYou're in for it later!
RITA: Sigh...\cIf only it wasn't my little brother\nnext to me, but a nice boyfriend...
RITA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have more POKéMON.
SAM: My big sister is tough at POKéMON!\cDon't cry when you lose!
SAM: Uh-oh...\nMy big sister will chew me out...
SAM: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\cThat's why she doesn't have a\nboyfriend.
SAM: Did you want to battle us?\nBring some more POKéMON, then.
RITA: Sigh...\cHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\cOh, hi, it's been a while. Let's battle\nso I won't have to dwell on things!
RITA: SAM!\nIt's your fault we lost again!\cWe're having a training session later!
RITA: Sigh...\cIf I had a nice boyfriend, we'd beat\nanyone with lovely combinations...
RITA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have more POKéMON.
SAM: If we lose, I'll catch heck.\nI'm going to go totally all out!
SAM: Uh-oh...\nMy big sister will chew me out again.
SAM: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\cShe's going to make me train really\nhard with POKéMON later...
SAM: Did you want to battle us?\nBring some more POKéMON, then.
I heard you approaching, so I hung\naround for you!
I beg for peace!
Sound travels faster in water than\nit does through air.
Hey, there!\nCheck out my sweet POKéMON!
I floundered...
I was blown away by HORSEA's charm,\nso I started swimming, too.
I'm tired of swimming.\nAre you up for a battle with me?
You're too much!
Whew...\nWhich way is it to MOSSDEEP CITY?
How would you like to take on the\nWATER-type POKéMON I raised?
I lost...
Your power... You're the real deal.\nI'm amazed!
Ahoy! I'm a buff, tough SAILOR!\nI've braved the world's seas!
Gwrroooar!\nI couldn't win!
The tide ebbs and flows inside the\nSHOAL CAVE.\cBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Did you know?
It's high time I get my payback\nfrom you! Come on, we're battling!
I couldn't win!\nI flat out couldn't win!
The SHOAL CAVE...\cThere are places you can and can't\nget to depending on the rise and fall\rof the tide.\cBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Don't forget!
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE. Someone told me.\rAre you going to see him, too?
KIM: I thought we would win.
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE, doesn't he?\cLet's go see him, IRIS!
KIM: No, no, no! You need two POKéMON,\nor it's just no good!
IRIS: KIM, can you tell me what we're\nlooking for out here?
IRIS: Oh, we came sort of close.
IRIS: KIM, are we really going into\nthe SHOAL CAVE?\rWe'll get all wet.
IRIS: Oh, we could never, ever do\nanything like a 2-on-1 battle.
Swimming is a full-body workout!\nYou will get fit!
I admit it! You win!
Thanks to my daily swimming routine...\nLook! Feast your eyes on this physique!
This towering white mountain of rock\nis SOOTOPOLIS CITY.
I was done in?
I can't find the entrance to\nSOOTOPOLIS. Where could it be?
Ufufufufu!\nI'm a mermaid!
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble!\nBlub, blub, blub...
You thrashed me... I want to\ndisappear in a wave of despair...
Hello, kiddo!\nWant a battle with me?
Oh, noooooh!
I love frolicking with POKéMON in\nthe sea like this!
I can see it in your face. You want\nto challenge me.
Awawawawawa...
A well-played match leaves me feeling\nrefreshed and serene.
Do you have a rival whom you just\nhate to lose against?
Arrrgh! I hate losing!
If you have a rival, don't you get the\nfeeling that you have to keep getting\rbetter?
Through fishing, I have attained a\nstate of becalmed serenity...\rPlease, allow me to demonstrate...
Though I have lost, my heart remains\ncalm...
It matters not that I catch nothing.\nThe line remains in the water...
Whoops! Don't tell me I snagged\na SURFING POKéMON?
I can't keep up!
Your POKéMON look pretty strong.\nThey'd be a handful if I hooked them!
Well, hey! This is a match between a\nPOKéMON fan and a fishing buff!
No! My line's all tangled!\nThe party's over!
My fishing line's doing a dance!\nThe tangle tango! Hahaha, snarl!
What I learned at DEWFORD's POKéMON\nGYM, I will put into practice here.
I was swamped!
BRAWLY, DEWFORD's GYM LEADER, used\nto train with a guy named BRUNO in\rKANTO, I've heard.
BIRD POKéMON have excellent vision.\nThey spot prey from great heights.
Whew... I give up.
There're lots of diving spots in the\nsea around here.\cYou can spot them easily from the sky\nbecause of their darker color.
EVER GRANDE CITY is still a long ways\naway...
My first victory seems to be far\naway, too...
My whole life has been about losing,\nbut I will never give up!
I'm still feeling good. I'll keep on\nswimming to EVER GRANDE CITY.
I've yet to taste my first victory...
I'll eventually reach EVER GRANDE CITY\nwhere I can eventually win...
You have to swim, cycle, and then run\na marathon in a triathlon.\cIt's a grueling race that consists\nof three events.
A POKéMON battle is grueling, too...
I have to ride a BIKE next, but...\nI'm about to throw in the towel...
A triathlon is long. But I guess the\nroad to become the POKéMON CHAMPION\ris also a long and grueling one.
A POKéMON battle really is harsh\nand unforgiving...
You should give serious thought to\nchallenges on VICTORY ROAD.
We've been working so hard to mount\na POKéMON LEAGUE challenge...\cWe can't afford to lose now!
Oh!\nHow could this happen?!
After all I've done to get here, I won't\ngive up after one setback.
There is no stronger TRAINER than I!
This can't be!
There probably is no stronger TRAINER\nthan you!
I want to visit EVER GRANDE, so I\ncaught myself a POKéMON that knows\rthe move WATERFALL to crest the falls.
I'm crestfallen!
Awww, phooey!\cMy POKéMON know WATERFALL, but\nI don't have the SOOTOPOLIS GYM BADGE!
This is my first triathlon.\nI'm all tense and nervous!
Wroooaaar!\nI failed to win!
If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to\ngive it my all.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nsure, why don't we battle?
I was sure I'd win!
Do you know what's the greatest thing\nabout triathlons?\cTesting the limits of your own\nstrength and endurance against\rMother Nature!
Say hey, hey!\nLet's get on with it!
Beat, I'm beaten.\nThat's it, done!
There's nothing for a loser.\nTime for me to beat it home.
What's the hurry?\nLet's take it slow and easy.
Oh, my.\nI wanted to relax a little more...
Don't you hate making mistakes when\nyou're in a rush?\cThat's why I try to take things\nslowly.
What a surprise! I didn't expect to\nsee a TRAINER out in the sea.\cI think we should battle!
This kid's awfully tough...
Your eyes have that look of someone\nwho's experienced harsh challenges\rand won. It suits you well!
In the deep blue sea,\nmy shattered blue heart finds\rcomfort among waves.
Like the vast blue sea,\nthe world of POKéMON spans\rdepths beyond belief.
The world's children dream\nof one day becoming the\rPOKéMON CHAMPION.
The sea is teeming with POKéMON.\nIt's not easy swimming, I tell you.
POKéMON raised by TRAINERS are\nseriously tough...
Gasp... Gasp... I'm wiped out...\cThe going's easy. It's the leaving\nthat's the hard part.\cWill I have any energy left to make\nthe return trip?
The sea... The sea... The sea...\nThe sea as far as these eyes can see!\rI'm sick and tired of the sea!
Bleah!
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.\cI'm a born swimmer!\nThat's what I am.
Hi, sweetie, wait!\nWe should battle, you and I!
You're tough in spite of the way\nyou look!
Did you see a guy over there who whines\nthat he's bored of the sea?\cThat's all talk.\nHe's hopelessly in love with the sea!
Why do men love bathing suits so much?\cThey all ogle me!
I'm out of my depth!
Maybe it's not my bathing suit that\nmakes men look. It must be my beauty!
RELI: We'll work together as siblings\nto take you on!
RELI: We couldn't win even though we\nworked together...
RELI: The people of PACIFIDLOG are\ntogether with the sea and POKéMON from\rthe time they are born.
RELI: You don't have two POKéMON?\nWe can't enjoy a battle, then.
IAN: I'm doing my best together with\nmy sis!
IAN: I did my best with my sis, but\nwe still couldn't win...
IAN: You know how PACIFIDLOG is\na floating town?\cSo, wherever there is the sea, that's\na part of PACIFIDLOG!
IAN: If you have two POKéMON, we'll\ntake you on!
I used to catch colds all the time as\na kid, but I became totally fit after\rI started swimming.
I crave more power...
TRAINERS travel the fields and\nmountains, so they must be fit, too.
I try not to swim where the currents\nare too strong.
Oh, please, no!
If I get swept away, I'll lose all my\nsense of place...
Win or lose, you'll never know until\nyou try!
Waah!\nI sank in defeat!
I never battle when I know I'll win.\nI like to battle at the razor's edge of\rvictory and defeat!
I contemplate POKéMON 24 hours a day.\nHow could you possibly beat me?
I lose.\nI will concede defeat.
Urggh...\nYou're a POKéMON fanatic, aren't you?\cYou must contemplate POKéMON 24 hours\na day, don't you?
Did the currents carry you here, too?\nThis must have been fated. Let's battle!
Strong!\nToo much so!
It's just my luck that a tough TRAINER\nlike you would drift here...\rI must be cursed...
I've led a life of woe and misery...\nI've been cast away, and this is where\rI've drifted...
Another loss...
A life adrift...\nI don't want it anymore!
Welcome!\nI've been expecting you!
No! Please!
A strong child TRAINER...\nThat's so annoying!
I want to win like everyone else, but I\nwon't raise POKéMON like everyone else.
Darn it!\nMy way is still too slack!
It's way more fun to do things the way\nI want than to be like everybody else.\rI mean, that's obvious!
I came all the way out here with my\nBIRD POKéMON.
You...\nYou're stunningly cool!
I'd like to go back to FORTREE, but I've\ngrown to like this place, too.
Even those POKéMON that can swim are\ncarried along by the rapid currents.
Aiyeeeeh!
I think POKéMON enjoy the fast-running\ncurrents around these parts.
My LUVDISC are looking for a fun\nmatch. Will you join us?
Oopsie!
There's a collector who's after the\nSCALES of LUVDISC.
Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang!\nIt's time for a match!
Tuckered out again...
My BIRD POKéMON get tired quickly after\na long flight...
You're a POKéMON TRAINER.\nNo need for words. We battle now.
... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ...
It was I who challenged you, and yet\nI lost. I am deeply shamed...
The savage tide in this area serves to\nmake us stronger than ever.
I concede defeat.
We will return for more training at\nMETEOR FALLS.\cIf you'd like, you should go, too.\nIt will definitely toughen you up!
REPEL's effect wore off...
Would you like to exit the SAFARI ZONE\nright now?
Ding-dong! Time's up!\nYour SAFARI Game is over.
You've run out of SAFARI BALLS.\nYour SAFARI Game is over.
Would you like to place a [POKEBLOCK]\non the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER?
The [STR_VAR_1] you left\nbefore is still here.
The [STR_VAR_1] was placed\non the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER.
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\cHere, you may witness many kinds of\nPOKéMON rarely seen in HOENN.\cAnd, you'll see them in their wild,\nuntamed state in natural habitats.\cWhat's more, we've thrown open the\ngates to POKéMON TRAINERS.\cYou're encouraged to catch POKéMON\nfor keeps!\cCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\nIs it your first time here?
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
When you enter the SAFARI ZONE, you\nstart with 30 SAFARI BALLS for\rcatching POKéMON.\cThe SAFARI Game is over when you run\nout of SAFARI BALLS, or when you've\rwalked 500 steps.\cCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\cAll you can catch for just $500!\nWould you like to play a SAFARI Game?
Okay.\nPlease play another time!
You don't have enough money.\nSorry.
That will be $500, please.
Here are your SAFARI BALLS.
[PLAYER] received 30 SAFARI BALLS.
We'll let you know when your game\nis over.\cSo, until then, enjoy yourself, please!\nOff you go on your wild excursion!
Excuse me!\nYour PC BOX is full.
Excuse me!\nYou seem to be without a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYour SAFARI Game will be much more\nfruitful if you use [POKEBLOCK]S.\cPlease come back with a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.
You still have time left. Would you like\nto exit the SAFARI ZONE now?
Please enjoy the rest of your wild\nadventure!
Okay.\cI'll take back your remaining SAFARI\nBALLS.\cThank you for playing.\nWe hope to see you again.
Good luck!\cIf you need anything, don't hesitate\nto tell me, please!
Did you know?\cIf you put a [POKEBLOCK] in that square box,\nPOKéMON gather around.
I want to keep going deeper, but I\nforgot to bring a BIKE.\cSomething tells me that rare POKéMON\nlive in the outlying areas.
Sometimes, when I toss a [POKEBLOCK] at \nPOKéMON, it gets ignored.\cDo POKéMON have likes and dislikes\nabout what they eat?
Gasp... Gasp...\nI...made it out here...but...\cI'm exhausted... I don't have the\nenergy to catch POKéMON...
I'm on a mission to find WATER POKéMON\nyou don't see in HOENN.\cDo you have any idea where the lake is?
I'm going to catch a lot of rare POKéMON\nhere and trade them with my friends!
I put a [POKEBLOCK] on the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER.\nBut it seems to have disappeared.\cI guess POKéMON must have eaten it\nwithout me noticing.
SAFARI ZONE TRAINER TIP!\cThrow [POKEBLOCK]S at wild POKéMON to make\nthem less likely to flee.
“Relieve your tired feet.”\nREST HOUSE
I don't have any [POKEBLOCK]S, but I caught\na good number of POKéMON.\cYou can improve your chances of making\na catch by getting closer to them\rbefore throwing a SAFARI BALL.
If you use [POKEBLOCK]S, wild POKéMON won't\nbe so quick to run away.\cIt's not much use to give [POKEBLOCK]S to\nPOKéMON that don't flee easily.
If you put a [POKEBLOCK] on the FEEDER,\nPOKéMON are attracted to it.\cI think POKéMON with the same sort of\nnature are drawn by a certain [POKEBLOCK].
The minimum wager at this table is [STR_VAR_1]. \nDo you want to play?
You don't have enough COINS.
Special rate table right now!
Place your wager with the + Control Pad,\nthen press the A Button.
It's a hit!
Jackpot!
Nothing doing!
You've won [STR_VAR_1] COINS!
No COINS left...
Keep playing?
The ROULETTE board will be cleared.
You don't have a COIN CASE.
Your COIN CASE is full!\nCoins can be exchanged for prizes.
I'm very interested in big [STR_VAR_1].\nThe bigger the better.\cHuh? Do you have a [STR_VAR_1]?\nP-p-please, show me!
Oh, my gosh, this is a big one!\nThis is a grand [STR_VAR_1]!\cThanks for showing me.\nThis is my thanks!
[PLAYER] received one [STR_VAR_2].
Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.
Hmm... I've seen a bigger [STR_VAR_1]\nthan this one.
Oh, now this is quite something...\nBut it's not a [STR_VAR_1]!
You don't have a big [STR_VAR_1]?\nThat's too bad...\cIf you get a big [STR_VAR_1],\nplease come show me.
The biggest [STR_VAR_1] in history!\n[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]-inch colossus!
PROF. BIRCH: Ah, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHave you come to show me how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along?
Hm? Oh, you haven't caught enough\nPOKéMON to make it worthwhile.
Hmhm...\cSo, you've seen [STR_VAR_1] POKéMON,\nand you've caught [STR_VAR_2] POKéMON...
You should go into grassy areas more\nand look for POKéMON more carefully.
I guess you're getting the hang of it.\nBut, it gets harder from here.
Some POKéMON only appear in certain\nareas. You'll need to be persistent.
Well, it could use more quantity, but\nthis is looking more like a POKéDEX now.
This is coming along pretty good.\nKeep up the effort.
Are you using any RODS?\nThere are many POKéMON in the sea.
Instead of just catching POKéMON,\nhow about making them evolve, too?
This is going to be a fantastic POKéDEX.\nThat's the feeling I'm getting.
You've collected this many...\nYour talent is remarkable!
Have you visited the SAFARI ZONE?\cI hear there are some POKéMON that\ncan only be caught there.
You've finally reached the 100-kind\nmark. This is an impressive POKéDEX!
There might be POKéMON that can be\nfound using ROCK SMASH.
You should get some more POKéMON by\ntrading with others.
I've heard of POKéMON that evolve when\nthey come to fully love their TRAINERS.
I had no idea that there were so many\nPOKéMON species in the HOENN region.
On occasion, some POKéMON appear in\nlarge numbers like wild outbreaks.\rDon't miss opportunities like those.
One can get a very good idea about the\nPOKéMON of the HOENN region by looking\rthrough your POKéDEX.
I'd say you already qualify as a POKéMON\nPROFESSOR, and a good one, too!
With a POKéDEX this complete, you're\na real professional at this!
You're very close to completing this\nPOKéDEX. I can feel it in my bones!
Congratulations!\nYour POKéDEX is complete!
Hmhm...\nOn a nationwide basis...\cYou've seen [STR_VAR_1] POKéMON,\nand you've caught [STR_VAR_2] POKéMON...
This is the POKéMON LOTTERY CORNER.\cAll shoppers visiting our DEPARTMENT\nSTORE get to draw a POKéMON LOTO\rTICKET.\cIf the LOTO TICKET's number matches\nthe ID number of any of your POKéMON,\ryou will receive a fabulous gift.\cWould you like to draw a POKéMON\nLOTO TICKET?
Please come back tomorrow.
Please do visit us again.
Please pick a LOTO TICKET.\n... ... ...
Please pick a LOTO TICKET.\n...[PAUSE 57] ...[PAUSE 57] ...[PAUSE 57]
The LOTO TICKET number is [STR_VAR_1].\cI need to run a check on this number\nto see if it matches any of your\rPOKéMON's ID numbers. Please wait.
Congratulations!\cThe ID number of your team's\n[STR_VAR_1] matches your LOTO TICKET's\rnumber!
Congratulations!\cThe ID number of your PC-boxed\n[STR_VAR_1] matches your LOTO TICKET's\rnumber!
I'm sorry.\nNone of the numbers matched.
Two digits matched, so you win the\nthird prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Three digits matched, so you win the\nsecond prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Four digits matched, so you win the\nfirst prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Oh, my goodness, all five digits matched!\cYou've won the jackpot prize!\nYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Oh?\nYou seem to have no room for this.\cPlease make room in your BAG and\nlet me know.
[PLAYER]?\nYes, I've been expecting you.\cThis is the prize we've been holding\nfor you.
Please do visit again.
DAD: [PLAYER]! Good to see you!\nThere's a letter here for you, [PLAYER].
DAD: I guess this is a PASS for a ship.\nBut I've never seen this ship before.\cYou should find out what this is about\nin LILYCOVE.
The ferry to SLATEPORT is...\cOh?\nThat PASS...
Aye, mate, are you the one who brought\nthat mighty odd PASS?\cI'll tell you, you're trying to reach a\ntiny spit of an island far in the south.\cThere's no telling what we'll encounter\nonce we reach there, aye.\rThat shivers my timbers!\cAll aboard!
Aye, mate, there's nothing here to\nsee or do on this forgettable island.\cWhat say we sail back to LILYCOVE?
Aye, right, then!\nSail home we will!
Aye, right, as you like, then.

DAD: Hi, [PLAYER]!\cI just received a very rare BERRY.\nI'd like you to have it.
If you see BERRIES growing in loamy\nsoil, feel free to take them.\cBut make sure you plant a BERRY in the\nsame spot. That's common courtesy.\cHere, I'll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a\nTRAINER, no?\cTRAINERS often make POKéMON hold\nBERRIES.\cIt's up to you whether to grow BERRIES\nor use them.
I watered my plants lots and lots!\nA whole bunch of flowers bloomed!\cAnd then a whole bunch of BERRIES\nappeared!\cHere you go!\nYou can have this!
I'm going to try really hard and make\nsome RED [POKEBLOCK]S!\cI hope you try hard, too!
I wonder what color BERRIES I'll look\nfor today?
I'm gathering BERRIES so I can win a\nPOKéMON CONTEST.\cIf you'd like, I'll share one with you.
Good luck to you, too!
What BERRIES should I plant today?\nWhat color [POKEBLOCK]S should I make?\cFretting over stuff like that is fun\nin its own way.
Give the case a shake, and out pops\na [POKEBLOCK]...\cAnd that [POKEBLOCK] is caught and eaten\nby a POKéMON...\cIt's an expression of love, isn't it?
Yes, yes.\nYou understand what I mean.\cYou should take this.
Oh... But it is important to make your\nown impressions, I guess...\cYou can have this.
I think that BERRY is rare.\nI hope you raise it with loving care.
I'll get more BERRIES from the\nBERRY MASTER.
When it gets right down to it...\cThe same way suits suit me perfectly,\na crisp breeze suits the sea.\cAnd you, a BERRY suits you to a “T”...\cWhy should that be so?
When it gets right down to it...\cIt's because you're a TRAINER!
When it gets right down to it...\cThe way dignified simplicity suits me,\n[POKEBLOCK]S perfectly suit POKéMON.
You may call me the BERRY MASTER.\cI dream of filling the world with\nbeautiful flowers, so I raise BERRIES\rand hand them out to everyone.\cYou're deserving of one!
Why be stingy?\nTake another!
Be sure to visit the PRETTY PETAL\nflower shop near RUSTBORO.\cLet flowers fill the world!
I'm done for today.\nCome again another day.\cLet flowers fill the world!
The way my husband grows BERRIES,\noh, he's the best in the world.\cHe makes me proud, that he does.\cIncidentally, child, have you heard\na good saying lately?
Ah! What a remarkable saying!\nInspirational, it is!\cI want you to have this.
Oh! A good saying it is.\nYou're quite remarkable.\cI want you to have this.
Our four grandchildren should become\nmore accomplished than my husband.\cJoy never goes out of my life!
Ah...
Hello!\cThis is the PRETTY PETAL flower shop.\nSpreading flowers throughout the world!
[PLAYER][KUN], would you like to learn about\nBERRIES?
Your name is?\c[PLAYER][KUN].\nThat's a nice name.\c[PLAYER][KUN], would you like to learn about\nBERRIES?
BERRIES grow on trees that thrive\nonly in dark, loamy soil.\cIf you take some BERRIES, be sure to\nplant one in the loamy soil again.\cA planted BERRY will soon sprout,\ngrow into a plant, flower beautifully,\rthen grow BERRIES again.\cI want to see the whole wide world\nfilled with beautiful flowers.\rThat's my dream.\cPlease help me, [PLAYER][KUN]. Plant BERRIES\nand bring more flowers into the world.
Flowers bring so much happiness to\npeople, don't they?
Hello!\cThe more attention you give to flowers,\nthe more beautifully they bloom.\cYou'll like tending flowers. I'm sure\nof it. You can have this.
While BERRY plants are growing,\nwater them with the WAILMER PAIL.\cOh, another thing.\cIf you don't pick BERRIES for a while,\nthey'll drop off onto the ground.\rBut they'll sprout again.\cIsn't that awesome?\nIt's like they have the will to live.
I'm trying to be like my big sisters.\nI'm growing flowers, too!\cHere you go! It's for you!
You can plant a BERRY and grow it big,\nor you can make a POKéMON hold it.\cBut now they have a machine that mixes\nup different BERRIES and makes candies\rfor POKéMON.\cI want some candy, too.
Hi, what's your name?\c... ... ...  ... ... ...  ... ... ...\nOkay. That's nice!\cMy name is KIRI.\cMy mommy and daddy named me that so\nI would grow healthy and warmhearted.\rThat's what they wished.\cYou can have one of these.
KIRI will give you this BERRY, too!\nI really like it lots!
I wonder what kind of wish is included\nin your name.
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\cIf you're born in springtime, do you like\nthe spring, and if you're born in the\rsummer, do you like the summer?
Then KIRI was born in the autumn,\nso I love the autumn!\cWhich season do you like?
Oh...\nIt doesn't matter...\cThere's so much that I want to know...
Are you planning on going deep in\nthere?\cHow about bringing me back some\nSHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS?\cI can make you something good if\nyou bring me the ingredients.
If you bring me four each of the\nSHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS,\rI can make you a SHELL BELL...\cYou can get those ingredients\nevery day.
Oh, hey! SHOAL SALT and SHOAL\nSHELLS! And enough of them, too!\cWould you like me to make you a\nSHELL BELL with them?
All righty, then! I'll make you a\nSHELL BELL right away.\c... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\cThere! Done!
Have a POKéMON hold on to that.\nIt'll love it, that's for certain.\cWhy, the SHELL BELL's chime...\nIt's simply sublime!\cYou can get its ingredients every\nday, so I can make you more.
Oh... Is that so...\nI wanted to make a SHELL BELL...
There was some SHOAL SALT here.\nBut, there's nothing here now.
There was a SHOAL SHELL here.\nBut, there's nothing here now.
You don't have space in your BAG\nif I were to make it for you.\cYou should make room and come back\nfor a SHELL BELL.
There's a set of POKéMON picture books.
It's filled with all sorts of books.
POKéMON magazines!\nPOKéMON PAL...\cPOKéMON HANDBOOK...\nADORABLE POKéMON...
This vase looks expensive...\nPeered inside...\cBut, it was empty.
It's empty.
The shelves brim with all sorts of\nPOKéMON merchandise.
A blueprint of some sort?\nIt's too complicated!

Would you like to save the game?
There is already a saved file.\nIs it okay to overwrite it?
SAVING...\nDON'T TURN OFF THE POWER.
[PLAYER] saved the game.
Save error...
There is a different game file that is\nalready saved.\cIs it okay to overwrite it?
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\cWelcome to the world of POKéMON!\cMy name is BIRCH.\cBut everyone calls me the POKéMON\nPROFESSOR.\c
This is what we call a “POKéMON.”
This world is widely inhabited by\ncreatures known as POKéMON.\cWe humans live alongside POKéMON,\nat times as friendly playmates, and\rat times as cooperative workmates.\cAnd sometimes, we band together\nand battle others like us.\cBut despite our closeness, we don't\nknow everything about POKéMON.\cIn fact, there are many, many\nsecrets surrounding POKéMON.\cTo unravel POKéMON mysteries,\nI've been undertaking research.\rThat's what I do.\c
And you are?
Are you a boy?\nOr are you a girl?
All right.\nWhat's your name?
So it's [PLAYER][KUN]?
Ah, okay!\cYou're [PLAYER][KUN] who's moving to my\nhometown of LITTLEROOT.\rI get it now!
All right, are you ready?\cYour very own adventure is about\nto unfold.\cTake courage, and leap into the\nworld of POKéMON where dreams,\radventure, and friendships await!\cWell, I'll be expecting you later.\nCome see me in my POKéMON LAB.\c

This is a newly discovered POKéMON.\nIt is currently under investigation.
No detailed information is available\nat this time.
BULBASAUR can be seen napping in\nbright sunlight.\nThere is a seed on its back.
By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed\ngrows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this POKéMON's back.\nTo support its weight, IVYSAUR's legs\nand trunk grow thick and strong.
If it starts spending more time lying\nin the sunlight, it's a sign that the\nbud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on VENUSAUR's\nback. The flower is said to take on vivid\ncolors if it gets plenty of nutrition
and sunlight. The flower's aroma\nsoothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its\ntail is an indication of its emotions.\nThe flame wavers when CHARMANDER is
enjoying itself. If the POKéMON becomes\nenraged, the flame burns fiercely.
CHARMELEON mercilessly destroys its\nfoes using its sharp claws.\nIf it encounters a strong foe, it turns
aggressive. In this excited state, the\nflame at the tip of its tail flares with a\nbluish white color.
CHARIZARD flies around the sky in\nsearch of powerful opponents.\nIt breathes fire of such great heat
that it melts anything. However, it\nnever turns its fiery breath on any\nopponent weaker than itself.
SQUIRTLE's shell is not merely used\nfor protection.\nThe shell's rounded shape and the
grooves on its surface help minimize\nresistance in water, enabling this\nPOKéMON to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich,\nthick fur. The tail becomes increasingly\ndeeper in color as WARTORTLE ages.
The scratches on its shell are evidence\nof this POKéMON's toughness as a\nbattler.
BLASTOISE has water spouts that\nprotrude from its shell. The water\nspouts are very accurate.
They can shoot bullets of water with\nenough accuracy to strike empty cans\nfrom a distance of over 160 feet.
CATERPIE has a voracious appetite.\nIt can devour leaves bigger than its\nbody right before your eyes.
From its antenna, this POKéMON releases\na terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this POKéMON's body\nis as hard as an iron slab.\nMETAPOD does not move very much.
It stays still because it is preparing\nits soft innards for evolution inside\nthe hard shell.
BUTTERFREE has a superior ability to\nsearch for delicious honey from\nflowers.
It can even search out, extract, and\ncarry honey from flowers that are\nblooming over six miles from its nest.
WEEDLE has an extremely acute sense\nof smell.\nIt is capable of distinguishing its
favorite kinds of leaves from those it\ndislikes just by sniffing with its big\nred proboscis (nose).
KAKUNA remains virtually immobile as it\nclings to a tree. However, on the\ninside, it is extremely busy as it
prepares for its coming evolution.\nThis is evident from how hot the shell\nbecomes to the touch.
BEEDRILL is extremely territorial.\nNo one should ever approach its nest -\nthis is for their own safety.
If angered, they will attack in a furious\nswarm.
PIDGEY has an extremely sharp sense\nof direction.\nIt is capable of unerringly returning
home to its nest, however far it may be\nremoved from its familiar surroundings.
PIDGEOTTO claims a large area as its\nown territory. This POKéMON flies\naround, patrolling its living space.
If its territory is violated, it shows\nno mercy in thoroughly punishing the\nfoe with its sharp claws.
This POKéMON has a dazzling plumage of\nbeautifully glossy feathers.\nMany TRAINERS are captivated by the
striking beauty of the feathers on its\nhead, compelling them to choose PIDGEOT\nas their POKéMON.
RATTATA is cautious in the extreme.\nEven while it is asleep, it constantly\nlistens by moving its ears around.
It is not picky about where it lives -\nit will make its nest anywhere.
RATICATE's sturdy fangs grow steadily.\nTo keep them ground down, it gnaws\non rocks and logs.
It may even chew on the walls of\nhouses.
SPEAROW has a very loud cry that can\nbe heard over half a mile away.\nIf its high, keening cry is heard
echoing all around, it is a sign that\nthey are warning each other of danger.
FEAROW is recognized by its long neck\nand elongated beak.\nThey are conveniently shaped for
catching prey in soil or water.\nIt deftly moves its long and skinny\nbeak to pluck prey.
EKANS curls itself up in a spiral while\nit rests.\nAssuming this position allows it to
quickly respond to a threat from any\ndirection with a glare from its upraised\nhead.
This POKéMON is terrifically strong in\norder to constrict things with its body.\nIt can even flatten steel oil drums.
Once ARBOK wraps its body around its\nfoe, escaping its crunching embrace is\nimpossible.
Whenever PIKACHU comes across\nsomething new, it blasts it with a jolt\nof electricity.
If you come across a blackened berry,\nit's evidence that this POKéMON\nmistook the intensity of its charge.
If the electrical sacks become\nexcessively charged, RAICHU plants its\ntail in the ground and discharges.
Scorched patches of ground will be\nfound near this POKéMON's nest.
SANDSHREW's body is configured to\nabsorb water without waste, enabling it\nto survive in an arid desert.
This POKéMON curls up to protect itself\nfrom its enemies.
SANDSLASH's body is covered by tough\nspikes, which are hardened sections of\nits hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall
out, to be replaced with new spikes that\ngrow out from beneath the old ones.
NIDORAN has barbs that secrete a\npowerful poison. They are thought to\nhave developed as protection for this
small-bodied POKéMON.\nWhen enraged, it releases a horrible\ntoxin from its horn.
When NIDORINA are with their friends or\nfamily, they keep their barbs tucked\naway to prevent hurting each other.
This POKéMON appears to become\nnervous if separated from the others.
NIDOQUEEN's body is encased in\nextremely hard scales. It is adept at\nsending foes flying with harsh tackles.
This POKéMON is at its strongest when\nit is defending its young.
The male NIDORAN has developed\nmuscles for moving its ears. Thanks to\nthem, the ears can be freely moved in
any direction. Even the slightest sound\ndoes not escape this POKéMON's notice.
NIDORINO has a horn that is harder than\na diamond. If it senses a hostile\npresence, all the barbs on its back
bristle up at once, and it challenges\nthe foe with all its might.
NIDOKING's thick tail packs enormously\ndestructive power. With one swing, it\ncan topple a metal transmission tower.
Once this POKéMON goes on a rampage,\nthere is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of\nthis POKéMON come out to play.\nWhen dawn arrives, the tired CLEFAIRY
return to their quiet mountain retreats\nand go to sleep nestled up against each\nother.
CLEFABLE moves by skipping lightly as if\nit were flying using its wings. Its\nbouncy step lets it even walk on water.
It is known to take strolls on lakes on\nquiet, moonlit nights.
At the time of its birth, VULPIX has one\nwhite tail. The tail separates into six\nif this POKéMON receives plenty of love
from its TRAINER.\nThe six tails become magnificently\ncurled.
NINETALES casts a sinister light from\nits bright red eyes to gain total\ncontrol over its foe's mind.
This POKéMON is said to live for a\nthousand years.
JIGGLYPUFF's vocal chords can freely\nadjust the wavelength of its voice.\nThis POKéMON uses this ability to sing
at precisely the right wavelength to\nmake its foes most drowsy.
WIGGLYTUFF has large, saucerlike eyes.\nThe surfaces of its eyes are always\ncovered with a thin layer of tears.
If any dust gets in this POKéMON's\neyes, it is quickly washed away.
ZUBAT remains quietly unmoving in a\ndark spot during the bright daylight\nhours. It does so because prolonged
exposure to the sun causes its body to\nbecome slightly burned.
GOLBAT loves to drink the blood of\nliving things. It is particularly active\nin the pitch black of night.
This POKéMON flits around in the night\nskies, seeking fresh blood.
During the daytime, ODDISH buries\nitself in soil to absorb nutrients from \nthe ground using its entire body.
The more fertile the soil, the glossier\nits leaves become.
GLOOM releases a foul fragrance from\nthe pistil of its flower. When faced\nwith danger, the stench worsens.
If this POKéMON is feeling calm and\nsecure, it does not release its usual\nstinky aroma.
VILEPLUME's toxic pollen triggers\natrocious allergy attacks. That's why\nit is advisable never to approach any
attractive flowers in a jungle, however\npretty they may be.
PARAS has parasitic mushrooms growing\non its back called tochukaso. They grow\nlarge by drawing nutrients from this
BUG/GRASS POKéMON host. They are\nhighly valued as a medicine for\nextending life.
PARASECT is known to infest large trees\nen masse and drain nutrients from the\nlower trunk and roots.
When an infested tree dies, they move\nonto another tree all at once.
VENONAT is said to have evolved with\na coat of thin, stiff hair that covers\nits entire body for protection.
It possesses large eyes that never fail\nto spot even miniscule prey.
VENOMOTH is nocturnal - it is a POKéMON\nthat only becomes active at night.\nIts favorite prey are small insects
that gather around streetlights,\nattracted by the light in the darkness.
DIGLETT are raised in most farms.\nThe reason is simple - wherever this\nPOKéMON burrows, the soil is left
perfectly tilled for planting crops.\nThis soil is made ideal for growing\ndelicious vegetables.
DUGTRIO are actually triplets that\nemerged from one body. As a result,\neach triplet thinks exactly like the
other two triplets.\nThey work cooperatively to burrow\nendlessly.
MEOWTH withdraws its sharp claws into\nits paws to slinkily sneak about without\nmaking any incriminating footsteps.
For some reason, this POKéMON loves\nshiny coins that glitter with light.
PERSIAN has six bold whiskers that give\nit a look of toughness. The whiskers  \nsense air movements to determine what
is in the POKéMON's surrounding\nvicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed\nby the whiskers.
PSYDUCK uses a mysterious power.\nWhen it does so, this POKéMON \ngenerates brain waves that are
supposedly only seen in sleepers.\nThis discovery spurred controversy\namong scholars.
The webbed flippers on its forelegs and\nhind legs and the streamlined body of\nGOLDUCK give it frightening speed.
This POKéMON is definitely much faster\nthan even the most athletic swimmer.
When MANKEY starts shaking and its\nnasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure\nsign that it is becoming angry.
However, because it goes into a\ntowering rage almost instantly, it is\nimpossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When PRIMEAPE becomes furious, its\nblood circulation is boosted. In turn,\nits muscles are made even stronger.
However, it also becomes much less\nintelligent at the same time.
GROWLITHE has a superb sense of smell.\nOnce it smells anything, this POKéMON\nwon't forget the scent, no matter what.
It uses its advanced olfactory sense\nto determine the emotions of other\nliving things.
ARCANINE is known for its high speed.\nIt is said to be capable of running over\n6,200 miles in a single day and night.
The fire that blazes wildly within this\nPOKéMON's body is its source of power.
POLIWAG has a very thin skin. It is\npossible to see the POKéMON's spiral\ninnards right through the skin.
Despite its thinness, however, the skin\nis also very flexible. Even sharp fangs\nbounce right off it.
The surface of POLIWHIRL's body is\nalways wet and slick with an oily fluid.\nBecause of this greasy covering, it can
easily slip and slide out of the clutches\nof any enemy in battle.
POLIWRATH's highly developed, brawny\nmuscles never grow fatigued, however\nmuch it exercises.
It is so tirelessly strong, this POKéMON\ncan swim back and forth across the\nPacific Ocean without effort.
ABRA sleeps for eighteen hours a day.\nHowever, it can sense the presence of\nfoes even while it is sleeping.
In such a situation, this POKéMON\nimmediately teleports to safety.
KADABRA emits a peculiar alpha wave\nif it develops a headache. Only those\npeople with a particularly strong
psyche can hope to become a TRAINER\nof this POKéMON.
ALAKAZAM's brain continually grows,\nmaking its head far too heavy to\nsupport with its neck.
This POKéMON holds its head up using\nits psychokinetic power instead.
MACHOP's muscles are special - they\nnever get sore no matter how much they\nare used in exercise.
This POKéMON has sufficient power to\nhurl a hundred adult humans.
MACHOKE's thoroughly toned muscles\npossess the hardness of steel.\nThis POKéMON has so much strength,
it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler\non just one finger.
MACHAMP has the power to hurl anything\naside. However, trying to do any work\nrequiring care and dexterity causes
its arms to get tangled.\nThis POKéMON tends to leap into action\nbefore it thinks.
BELLSPROUT's thin and flexible body\nlets it bend and sway to avoid any\nattack, however strong it may be.
From its mouth, this POKéMON spits a\ncorrosive fluid that melts even iron.
WEEPINBELL has a large hook on its rear\nend. At night, the POKéMON hooks on to\na tree branch and goes to sleep.
If it moves around in its sleep, it may\nwake up to find itself on the ground.
VICTREEBEL has a long vine that\nextends from its head. This vine is\nwaved and flicked about as if it were
an animal to attract prey. When an\nunsuspecting prey draws near, this\nPOKéMON swallows it whole.
TENTACOOL's body is largely composed\nof water. If it is removed from the\nsea, it dries up like parchment.
If this POKéMON happens to become\ndehydrated, put it back into the sea.
TENTACRUEL has large red orbs on its\nhead. The orbs glow before lashing the\nvicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast.
This POKéMON's outburst creates rough\nwaves around it.
The longer a GEODUDE lives, the more\nits edges are chipped and worn away,\nmaking it more rounded in appearance.

GOLEM live up on mountains.\nIf there is a large earthquake, these\nPOKéMON will come rolling down off
the mountains en masse to the\nfoothills below.
PONYTA is very weak at birth.\nIt can barely stand up.\nThis POKéMON becomes stronger by
stumbling and falling to keep up with\nits parent.
RAPIDASH usually can be seen casually\ncantering in the fields and plains.\nHowever, when this POKéMON turns
serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze\nas it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
SLOWPOKE uses its tail to catch prey by\ndipping it in water at the side of a\nriver.
However, this POKéMON often forgets\nwhat it's doing and often spends entire\ndays just loafing at water's edge.
SLOWBRO's tail has a SHELLDER firmly\nattached with a bite. As a result, the\ntail can't be used for fishing anymore.
This causes SLOWBRO to grudgingly swim\nand catch prey instead.
MAGNEMITE attaches itself to power\nlines to feed on electricity.\nIf your house has a power outage,
check your circuit breakers. You may\nfind a large number of this POKéMON\nclinging to the breaker box.
MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic\nforce that is fatal to mechanical\ndevices. As a result, large cities sound
sirens to warn citizens of large-scale\noutbreaks of this POKéMON.
FARFETCH'D is always seen with a stick\nfrom a plant of some sort. Apparently,\nthere are good sticks and bad sticks.
This POKéMON has been known to fight\nwith others over sticks.
DODUO's two heads never sleep at the\nsame time.\nIts two heads take turns sleeping,
so one head can always keep watch for\nenemies while the other one sleeps.
Watch out if DODRIO's three heads are\nlooking in three separate directions.\nIt's a sure sign that it is on its guard.
Don't go near this POKéMON if it's being\nwary - it may decide to peck you.
SEEL hunts for prey in the frigid sea\nunderneath sheets of ice.\nWhen it needs to breathe, it punches
a hole through the ice with the\nsharply protruding section of its head.

This POKéMON enters sewer pipes to\ndrink filthy wastewater.
From MUK's body seeps a foul fluid that\ngives off a nose-bendingly horrible\nstench.
Just one drop of this POKéMON's body\nfluid can turn a pool stagnant and\nrancid.
At night, this POKéMON uses its broad\ntongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor\nsand and then sleep in it.
While it is sleeping, SHELLDER closes its\nshell, but leaves its tongue hanging\nout.
CLOYSTER is capable of swimming in the\nsea. It does so by swallowing water,\nthen jetting it out toward the rear.
This POKéMON shoots spikes from its\nshell using the same system.
GASTLY is largely composed of gaseous\nmatter. When exposed to a strong wind,\nthe gaseous body quickly dwindles away.
Groups of this POKéMON cluster under\nthe eaves of houses to escape the\nravages of wind.
HAUNTER is a dangerous POKéMON.\nIf one beckons you while floating in\ndarkness, you must never approach it.
This POKéMON will try to lick you with its\ntongue and steal your life away.
Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow\nthrown by a streetlight will suddenly\nand startlingly overtake you.
It is actually a GENGAR running past\nyou, pretending to be your shadow.

However, because the claw is so heavy,\nthe POKéMON quickly tires.
VOLTORB was first sighted at a company\nthat manufactures POKé BALLS.\nThe link between that sighting and
the fact that this POKéMON looks very\nsimilar to a POKé BALL remains a\nmystery.
ELECTRODE eats electricity in the\natmosphere. On days when lightning\nstrikes, you can see this POKéMON
exploding all over the place from\neating too much electricity.
This POKéMON consists of six eggs that\nform a closely knit cluster. The six eggs\nattract each other and spin around.
When cracks increasingly appear on the\neggs, EXEGGCUTE is close to evolution.
EXEGGUTOR originally came from the\ntropics. Its heads steadily grow larger\nfrom exposure to strong sunlight.
It is said that when the heads fall off,\nthey group together to form EXEGGCUTE.
CUBONE pines for the mother it will\nnever see again. Seeing a likeness of\nits mother in the full moon, it cries.
The stains on the skull the POKéMON\nwears are made by the tears it sheds.

This POKéMON has an indomitable spirit\nand will never give up in the face of\nadversity.
Whenever LICKITUNG comes across\nsomething new, it will unfailingly give it\na lick. It does so because it memorizes
things by texture and by taste.\nIt is somewhat put off by sour things.
If KOFFING becomes agitated, it raises\nthe toxicity of its internal gases and\njets them out from all over its body.
This POKéMON may also overinflate its\nround body, then explode.
WEEZING loves the gases given off by\nrotted kitchen garbage. This POKéMON\nwill find a dirty, unkempt house and
make it its home. At night, when the\npeople in the house are asleep, it will\ngo through the trash.
RHYHORN runs in a straight line,\nsmashing everything in its path.\nIt is not bothered even if it rushes
