Hi! I am a humble Maid!\c\nMy master has a big heart to match his\nbig belly. He's a gourmet!\c\nSo I am looking for ingredients that will\nmake his heart jump for joy!\c
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff...\c\nOh, that aroma! It smells so gourmet!\c\nDo you have a wonderful ingredient in\nyour Bag?\r\nWould you consider selling it to me?\c
Oh, it smells so good!\c\nThat [VAR 0109(0000)] of yours is a very\nrare ingredient indeed!\c\nWould you take $[VAR 0207(0001)] for it?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)] and\nreceived $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
Merci! Thank you!!\c\nWith this, I can create a superb menu.\nMy master will be so surprised!
Hmmm... This is not quite what I'm\nlooking for.\c\nI don't think my master will be satisfied\nwith such a smell...
Aww... Well, that's OK.\c\nIf you find a gourmet ingredient for me,\nplease let me know!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff...\c\nWell, I don't smell anything interesting\nin your Bag.\c\nBut if you find a gourmet ingredient,\nplease let me know!
Ore, ore, ore...\nOres that I adore!\c\nAh, this is where you should laugh...\c\nAnyway... I will pay you well for\nrare ores.\c\nAnd not just ores! Stones, gems,\nshards...anything mineral! I love it all!\c
Don't you have an adorable ore\nthat shakes my core?\c
Oh, I do adore the ores!\c\nThat [VAR 0109(0000)], it's shaking me!\nWill you sell it for $[VAR 0207(0001)]?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)]\nand received $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
The deal is done!\nI've scored an ore I can adore!
Huh? What on earth is this?\c\nYou can't shake my core\nwith an ore so poor!
Hmmm. My core won't change.\nI hope you sell it to me someday.
Don't you have an adorable ore\nthat shakes my core?\c\nHmmmm. You don't seem to have it.\nCome back again.
As you can see,\nI am an ultrarich billionaire!\c\nAnd as you can see,\nmy hobby is to collect rare items!\c\nIn fact, this outfit is ultra expensive\nand rare.\r\nCan you see it? Can you?\c
There's something that this billionaire\nwants to get his hands on, even if it\r\nmeans spending a lot of money.\c\nDo you have such a rare item?\nDo you?\c
That [VAR 0109(0000)]!! Will you sell it to me\nfor $[VAR 0207(0001)]? Will you?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)]\nand received $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
I got a very good item!\nDon't you think it's great? Don't you?
This is slightly different.\nDon't you think so, too? Don't you?
If you ever change your mind,\nwill you sell me the rare item? Will you?
Actually, it's...\nIt's a rare treasure, Relic Crown!\c\nI was told it was at the innermost part\nof the Abyssal Ruins!\c\nI think it is understandable that you\nwant to treasure it, but will you sell it\r\nto me for $[VAR 0207(0001)]? Will you?
There's something that this billionaire\nwants to get his hands on, even if it\r\nmeans spending a lot of money.\c\nDo you have such a rare item?\nDo you?\c\nGrrr! You don't have a rare item,\ndo you?
Hey, check it out. I've got a sweet deal\nfor ya!\c\nYou know how Pokémon like to hide behind\nstones or rocks, yeah?\c\nSometimes they hide cool stuff, too.\c\nIf you find something cool behind a rock,\nyou should bring it to me.\c\nI'll make it worth your while.\c
What's up?\nDid you find something cool for me?\c
Hey, nice! Let me check out\nthat [VAR 0109(0000)]...\c\nI'll give you $[VAR 0207(0001)] for it.\nWhaddaya say?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)]\nand received $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
Hey, thanks!\c\nI bet I can sell this to a collector for\nway more than I just gave you.\c\nHa! That's business for ya!
Nope, this is no good. Not worth my while.
Hey, come see me if you find something\ncool, got it?\c\nI'll make it worth your while.
What's up?\nDid you find something cool for me?\c\n...Nope, nothing cool in your Bag.\nOh well. Maybe next time!

Leo: Check me out! The excitement\nof the big city has made me stronger!\c
Looks like I wasn't wound up enough...\nI need a little more urban atmosphere.
Maybe all of this excitement is\na little too much for me...
Living in a fast-paced environment\nhelps with a person's growth.\r\nThis city is a model for those words.
Silvia: My glasses have locked onto you!\nLet's have a Pokémon battle!\c
Th-there’s a crack in my glasses.\nThat was a smashing battle!
The time I've spent here has been\nreally fun and wonderful!\c\nBut, being this surrounded by excitement\nmakes you miss nature somehow!
All the buildings reflected in my glasses\nare dazzling enough to make me dizzy!
Dave: Hey! You've got it goin' on!\nLet's get a Pokémon battle goin'\r\nto see who's got it goin' on the most!\c
No one's got it goin' on more than you!\nYou can hang out with all the tough guys!
The life of a tough guy in the city is\na little much.\c\nWhite Forest is looking better\nall the time.
This city is big and tough, just like me!\nWhat do you think of me now? I've got it\r\ngoin' on as much as it will go! Right?
Britney: Hey there! You over thataway!\nHave a Pokémon battle with me!\c\nBring heaps of cute Pokémon, OK?\c
Whoa, what was that?!\c\nYou are way strong!\nThere's no chance I'm keepin' up!
All the racket in this city is getting\nto be too much.\c\nI want to lie on my back in the\nwide-open spaces!
I have to try somethin' awful to keep up\nwith city life! But I still enjoy it a bit.
Robbie: In Black City, my groove's\ngetting into a groove! And in battle,\r\nI'll never lose!\c
Ooh, now I'm grooveless.\nBut I'll get my groove back, so\r\nlet's battle again sometime!
Aaah! I've grooved my way into a rut!\nI want to take a break in White Forest!
Developing and developing.\nBlack City changes every day!\r\nI love that about this place!
Miki: Hello!\nI'm a fan of sudden beginnings!\c\nLet's get right to the Pokémon battle!\c
Oh, gosh. I already lost?\nSudden endings, I'm not such a fan of!
It's too busy and noisy, and it's enough\nto make a slow-paced person like me\r\ndizzy. I want to relax in White Forest.
I was worried, since I'm a little laid back\nand do things at my own speed,\r\nthat Black City and I aren't a good fit.\c\nBut it'll work out, and it's fun here!
Ryder: Hyah! Hello!\nI want to test my strength against you!\r\nThat's OK, right?\c
Huh... So that's how much I've improved.\c\nThanks! Battling with you\nhas given me a goal!
Hyah! Hyah... Hyah?\nMy heart's not really into it.\r\nMaybe I just can't concentrate here.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!!\c\nSince strong people gather here, it's\nthe optimal place for a test of strength!
Karenna: Faster! Faster! I'm ready\nto go! Please spar with me!\c
Thank you very much! I still haven't\ntrained enough. I need to be faster!
There are many things to learn from\nbattle, but to improve on what I learned,\r\nI want to run and train in the forest.
There is a lot to learn from battles!\nI want to battle more and more!
Doug: Hello, hello! Nice to work with you!\c\nHow about a Pokémon battle to celebrate\nour new acquaintance?\c
Hey! You must be Unova's best!
Black City has everything! But if there's\none thing it's missing, it's...\c\nNature! Relaxation! I want to relax!
Black City is full of hustle and bustle!\nI'm sure my work will progress here!
Vincent: You don't really think you can\nbeat me, Black City's Ace Trainer?\c
An Ace Trainer like me, losing?!\nThis doesn't count! It just doesn't!
I was born and raised in the city, but\nI think nature is really great.\r\nI want to go to White Forest.
The awesomeness of this city\nspices up my life!
Marie: Take deep, deep breaths before\nbattle. When your mind is clear,\r\nthe battle can begin!\c
I overthought things, and I lost...\c\nSometimes just acting on instinct\nmight be better.
I was working on my paper, but now\nI've got writer's block.\c\nMaybe getting some fresh air in\nWhite Forest would clear my head.
Black City is really exciting, and there's\nalways so much going on.\r\nIt gives me lots of ideas!
Lena: Since I started my journey as a\nPokémon Trainer, I haven't lost\r\nmany battles.\c\nCan you make me lose?\c
Oh. I really lost, didn't I...?\nIt's strange. I'm usually calm, but now\r\nI'm a little frustrated.
In the end, everything returns\nto nature, no matter what.\c\nSo that's why White Forest may\nbe so calming...
People build buildings because\nthey fear the power of nature.\r\nThat's why I feel so calm here...
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\c\nWe must've met here because of fate!\nLet's have a Pokémon battle!\c
Black City battles really\nmake a person excited, huh?
Hmmm. I think I'd like\nto see somewhere else soon.
Black City has so much to see.\nI never get tired of it!
Molly: If you look at everything while\nwalking, you make eye contact with\r\nvarious Trainers.\c\nWhich Pokémon will you use, Trainer who\nmet my gaze?\c
When you don't feel confident,\nlower your eyes as you walk.\r\nThat is a bit of wisdom.
When there is this much commotion,\nit's hard to calm down.\r\nI want to relax somewhere quiet.
Black City always feels like it is\ngoing forward. It's really cool, isn't it?
Frederic: Oh! Have a look at this!\c\nMy Pokémon is saying it wants to battle\nwith yours!\c
My Pokémon is saying that was\na good battle.\c\nDon't you think my Pokémon\nis truly well mannered?
I love this place, but my Pokémon\nseems unsatisfied.\r\nMaybe I should take it to White Forest.
This is definitely the best place for me.\c\nThe constant change and development\nreally put me in high spirits.
Lynette: How do you do?\c\nWould you please let me see\nif you are strong or not?\c
Ah, you are a strong person!\nI can feel it in my heart.
I've grown a little tired of looking for\nmy Prince Charming.
There are many strong people in this\ncity, so I never get bored!\c\nI want to meet more and more\nstrong people!
Pierce: Phew! What a thrilling lifestyle!\c\nWant to taste the thrill with\na Pokémon battle?\c
That felt like being on the edge!\nIt was thrilling and fun!
Aaahhh. I'm even getting tired of\nthrilling things. I want to pass time\r\nslowly and simply with my Pokémon...
Black City is great. It has culture,\nand you can live comfortably.\c\nI think when you're picking a place\nto live, living comfortably is important!
Gene: I can't remember how many\nPokémon I've encountered...\c\nWhy don't you test your powers\nagainst someone like me?\c
Hmmm... I still have a long way to\ngo as a Trainer.
I want to meet more Pokémon\nin my day-to-day life.
You can keep battling more and more\nand test your power here!\r\nBlack City is a great city!
Piper: Fight efficiently and without\nwaste! That is my policy!\c
Your efficient fighting style\nis truly wonderful!
Maybe there's more to life\nthan efficiency...
Efficiency is everything in\nbattling and in business.\c\nBlack City is efficient.\nI like that in a place!
Miho: I'm adorable, and so is my Pokémon!\nDo you think you can win against us?\c
How can we lose when we're so cute?
I've been thinking lately that it would be\nbetter for my Pokémon and me to get back\r\nto nature...
You can get everything in Black City, so\nI'm sure I can find things that will help\r\nme become cuter and stronger!
Shane: You strong? I'm sure you are!\nI'll check by battling with you!\c
I see...\nI must be weak, then...
I'm a little tired of living a life where\nI'm worried about how people see me.
In Black City, I can always confirm what\nkind of guy I am by battling others.\r\nIt's easy to understand.
Ralph: My feelings! I'll use a Pokémon\nbattle to get them through!\c
Did some of my excitement\nget through to you?
Recently, I've been thinking I don't\njust want to try and get my feelings\r\nthrough to people, but I also want\r\nto listen a little better...\c\nI want to live the slow life in\nWhite Forest.
In Black City, you can quickly let me know\nhow you feel!\c\nThis directness feels really great!
Eliza: I want this! I want that! But what\nI really want is to beat you in a\r\nPokémon battle!\c
My oh my...\nI lost!
Even if I buy a lot of stuff, I'm still\nunsatisfied... I have times like that!
In Black City, you can get whatever\nyou want! You can live securely!
Collin: Pokémon battles are good\nfor business!\c\nI'll defeat you and take advantage of\nthe business opportunity!\c
My business opportunity!\nIt's going up in smoke!!
Business opportunities don't just come\nrolling your way...\c\nMaybe White Forest is a better fit\nfor me...
Time is limited!\c\nI want to always give things my all\nso I don't regret anything!
Ken: I've dedicated my life to Pokémon\nbattling. I will win as a specialist!\c
I apparently still haven't done enough\nresearch on Pokémon battling.
All I think about every day is\nPokémon battling.\c\nBut maybe it would be better\nto think about other things, too...\r\nI think that sometimes.
If I'm in Black City, I can focus on\nPokémon battling and get really good!\c\nI'll try to master one thing!
Jacques: Win or lose!\nContests have a clear answer!\c\nI'm going to research\nyour battling style.\c
The result is a loss.\nIt's a beautiful, clear answer.
Just one answer...\c\nI think there may be a way of research\nthat looks for something besides that.
In Black City, you can get a clear answer\nif you battle...\r\nIt's satisfying for a researcher.
Rosa: Life is just killing time.\nDon't you think so?\r\nPlay with me for a bit!\c
I managed to kill some time!
I might not know what to do with a life of\nkilling time every day!
Black City has lots of ways to kill time,\nso I never get bored! It's great!!
Herman: I can't be tied down to a single\nplace... I wander around, and today's\r\nanother battle!\c
I lost! This city doesn't fit me well.
Just staying in one place...\nI'd like to try living like that.
Wandering and having Pokémon battles!\nI like living like this!
Emi: Pokémon battling...\nThat is the goal for my journey!\c
I couldn't win! But this is one of the\nthrills of battling!
Recently, I've been thinking I would like\nto take a more leisurely trip without any\r\nparticular destination in mind.
In Black City, I can enjoy Pokémon\nbattles, and it fits my\r\njourney perfectly!
Grace: I am about to show you the beauty\nof artistic Pokémon battling!\r\nPlease be overwhelmed!\c
The combination of you and your Pokémon\nwas very beautiful!!
There is a limit to the beauty a person\ncan create...\r\nI feel like that when I look at this city.
My heart dances in delight at the\ncalculated beauty of a city built\r\nby people!
Black City\nProsperous and Vibrant

The power of civilization is amazing...\nWe can make anything people could want!
Hee hee! Let's have a Rotation Battle!

Heh! Scared of me, aren't you?!
Rotation Battles are shocking!

Rotation Battles use three Pokémon!\nSo get three of yours ready!
Scared of how lucky I am, huh?
Hmmmph. I only lost today because\nI got unlucky.

Hey there!\nI'm Fennel.\c\nProfessor Juniper asked me\nto give you something.\r\nPlease, follow me!\c
Are you looking for the Gym Leader?\c\nHe is not here.\nHe could be in the Trainers' School.\c\nIf you want to challenge him,\nplease go find him.\c\nThe Trainers' School is not far from\nthis Gym.
Yes? Yes, I am a Gym Leader of this town.\nYou are...?\c\nRight. You want to challenge the Gym.\c\nIn that case...\nWhat was the first Pokémon you chose?\c\n[VAR 0101(0000)]... I see. It's weak against\n[VAR 0103(0001)]-type Pokémon.\c\nI think you need to prepare to face\nthat type.\c\nI'll be waiting for you inside.\c
Yes? Yes, I am a Gym Leader\nof this town.\r\nYou are...?\c\nRight. You want to challenge the Gym.\c\nIn that case...\nWhat was the first Pokémon you chose?\c\n[VAR 0101(0000)]... I see. It's weak against\n[VAR 0103(0001)]-type Pokémon.\c\nI think you need to prepare to face\nthat type.\c\nFor example, try training your Pokémon\nin the Dreamyard.\c\nPlease excuse me now.\c
You don't seem to have any Gym Badges,\nso I can't let you by.\c\nWith your lack of training, you'll have\na hard job making any progress.\c\nLet me give you some friendly advice.\c\nChallenge a Gym Leader in this town,\nand test your ability!
You don't seem to have\nany Gym Badges.\c\nWith your lack of experience,\nyou'll have a hard time in the future.\c\nHere's some friendly advice.\nChallenge a Gym Leader in this town,\r\nand test your ability!\c
The scientist Fennel was looking for you\na little while ago!
The scientist Fennel was looking for you\na little while ago!\c
Wow!\nIt's a shiny Gym Badge!\c\nGetting that Badge proved you have skill\nenough to handle whatever comes next!
The Striaton City Gym Leader.\c\nNo matter how often I challenge him,\nhe always uses Pokémon\r\nthat I don't like...
If a Pokémon type and a move type are\nthe same, the move's power will increase!\r\nThe Gym Leader told me!
At the site of an old factory,\nat a place we call the Dreamyard,\r\nthere's an unusual Pokémon\r\nthat can make dreams appear!
I too studied at the Trainers' School\nwhen I was a beginner.
Do you know how Technical Machines work?\c\nA TM can instantly teach a move to a\nPokémon. You can use it over and over\r\nwith different Pokémon. How cool is that?
Er... Um...\c\nGrass-type Pokémon are\nweak against Fire-type moves.\c\nI know more stuff!
Er... Um...\c\nWater-type Pokémon are\nweak against Grass-type moves.\c\nI know more stuff!
Um... Er...\c\nFire-type Pokémon are\nweak against Water-type moves.\c\nI know more stuff!
Some Trainers train themselves and\ntheir Pokémon in the Dreamyard.\c\nYou might think about going there...\nCould be you'll find something...
I'm so glad you came.\nI'd like to give you this!\c
To live quietly and do a lot of fishing...\nI truly live my ideal existence!
Pokémon can be found in dark places, too.\nThat's when a Dusk Ball can do the trick!\r\nHere's one for you.\c
A Dusk Ball works well at night\nor in a cave.\c\nPlus, its name is excellent!\nThe Dusk Ball. Dusk!
Striaton City\nThree Stand Together as One!
Dreamyard ahead.\nA place for novice Trainers.

Chili: Oh, enough! Listen up!\c\nThe three of us will\ndecide whom you'll battle!\c\nIt'll be based on the type of\nthe first Pokémon you chose!\c
Cress: That is indeed the case.\c\nAnd the partner you first chose was\n[VAR 0103(0000)] type, it seems.\c
Ta-da! The Fire-type scorcher Chili--\nthat's me--will be your opponent!\c
That is correct!\c\nIt shall be I and my esteemed Water\ntypes that you must face in battle!\c
Nothing personal... No hard feelings...\nMe and my Grass-type Pokémon will...um...\r\nWe're gonna battle, come what may.\c
Yeeeeooow!\c\nTime to play with FIRE!!\nI'm the strongest of us brothers!\c
What incredible luck for you--you get to\nbattle the best among the three of us.\c
So, um, if you're OK with me, I'll, um,\nput everything I've got into being, er,\r\nyou know, your opponent.\c
Aww, man!\nI was all fired up, too!
How exceedingly lucky for you\nthat you do not have to face me.
...Uh hm. I always seem to lose\nthe timing of...of the dance. Like that.\c\nTrue enough, I did want to...\nwant to have a Pokémon battle with you.
Whoa ho! You're on fire!\c\nWell, it's the Pokémon League's rule.\nTake this Gym Badge!\c
Why, you're quite remarkable.\c\nIt's the Pokémon League's rule, so--\nplease take this Badge.\c
...What a surprise.\nYou...are very strong.\c\nSeems like not even\nChili or Cress could beat you...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nthe Trio Badge from Chili!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nthe Trio Badge from Cress!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nthe Trio Badge from Cilan!\c
Gym Badges are proof\nof a Trainer's abilities.\c\nIf you have one Badge, Pokémon, including\ntraded Pokémon up to Lv. 20,\r\nwill obey you without question.\c\nWe also want you to have this.\c
[VAR 0109(0000)] contains Work Up.\c\nIf you use Work Up, the Pokémon's\nAttack and Sp. Atk go up!\c\nBy the way, TMs can be used\nas many times as you want.
In the Unova region, we are still\nnovice Gym Leaders.\c\nWhich means the other Gym Leaders\nare much stronger than we are.\r\nWe'll need to work hard and improve.
I can't believe TMs can be used\nover and over!\c\nIf you wanted, you could use one to\nteach all your Pokémon the same move!
If there were 17 siblings in\nthe Striaton City Gym...\c\nThere could be a specialist for\neach type of Pokémon.
Cilan: In the Unova region, um,\nwe are still novice Gym Leaders.\c\nWhich means, well, that other Gym\nLeaders are much stronger than we are.\c\nGoing...slow...and steady...is OK, so...\nwe compete with one another\r\nand get, um, stronger and stronger.
Chili: Oh! It's you!\c\nYour fire is more intense than\nwhen you got the Trio Badge!
Cress: ...We heard about\nthe incident with N's Castle.\c\nIf we had received the message in time,\nthe three of us could have helped.
Hello! I'm Clyde. I'm the guide for\nTrainers challenging a Pokémon Gym.\c\nWe appreciate your challenging the Gym.\nTake this to commemorate the occasion.\c
One basic element of Pokémon battles is\nthe relationship between types.\c\nIf you choose Pokémon with effective\ntypes and effective moves,\r\nvictory is just a step away!\c\nIn this Gym, you proceed by\nstepping on the switch with\r\nthe type that is effective against the\r\nPokémon type shown on the curtain.
I hope you'll always remember the\nincredible moment when you received\r\nthis Gym Badge.
Welcome!\c\nWe are very proud of our menu,\nwhich we adjust to suit each Trainer!

Fennel: You're going to meet all of the\nPokémon in the Unova region. Am I right?\c\nOh, the stairs are right here!\c
Fennel: My room is upstairs here.\nCome on, go upstairs!\c
After a battle, to my surprise,\nmy Pokémon evolved and\r\nchanged its appearance!
Some evolve and some don't...\c\nPokémon really are mysterious creatures.
You can't go upstairs now!\c\n'Cause Fennel said she was testing\nsomething, and she had a scary look\r\non her face!
She may not look like it,\nbut Fennel is a great scientist!

So like I said, I'm Fennel, and as you can\nsee, I'm a scientist.\c\nIn fact, the subject I'm researching\nis Trainers!\c\nProfessor Juniper is my friend\nfrom college.\c\nShe asked me to help you guys.\c
So!\c\nI'll give you something to help you.\nThis is a Hidden Machine for you!\c



There are some moves that a Pokémon can\nuse even when it is not fighting!\c\nWith this Hidden Machine, you can teach\nyour Pokémon a move called Cut.\r\nIt can cut down a small tree.\c\nAnd you can use the Hidden Machine as\nmany times as you want, like a TM.\r\nIsn't that great?\c\nBut it's difficult to make a Pokémon\nforget a hidden move once it learns it.\c
And I'd like to ask you a favor, too!\c\nThere is a place called the Dreamyard\non the outskirts of Striaton City.\c\nI'd like some of the Dream Mist that a\nPokémon there called Munna gives off.\c\nWith that, I'll be able to use\n[VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync [VAR FF00(0000)]to collect save files of\r\nvarious Trainers!
Fennel: Did Juniper ask you to complete\nthe Pokédex?\c\nIt is a challenge to update the Pokédex\nregularly, isn't it?\c\nOops! I got distracted! Please bring me\nsome of the Dream Mist that Munna\r\ngives off in the Dreamyard!
Fennel: Ta-da!\c\nThanks to you, I got some Dream Mist,\nand now I can collect save files of\r\nvarious Trainers!\r\nThank you very much!\c\nAs a token of my appreciation,\nI will give you this C-Gear to use!\c\nThe C-Gear is a device related to\ncommunications, such as\r\nInfrared Connection or\r\nNintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] obtained the [VAR FF00(0002)]C-Gear[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Turn on the C-Gear and\nestablish communications?
Yes
No
Some functions of the C-Gear\nwill be restricted. Is that OK?
Wireless communications\nare turned OFF.\c\nTurn wireless communications\nON in the System Settings.\r\nError code: 50699\c
You see! The C-Gear was activated, and\nthat screen showed up!\c\nIf you touch the “?" icon at the\nbottom-right of the screen, you can read\r\nabout the C-Gear.\c
If you want to turn on the C-Gear, touch\nthe Power symbol at the bottom right of\r\nthe screen.\c\nThen, after turning on the power, if you\ntouch the “?" icon at the bottom right\r\nof the screen, you can read about\r\nthe C-Gear.\c
About [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)]...\c\nI'd like to explain a little more about the\nsystem to collect Trainers' save files.\c\nDo you have time to learn more?
I am sorry!\nI am so happy, so I will explain about it!\c\nBecause, thanks to you, we can do a\ngreat thing!\c
Now [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync [VAR FF00(0000)]can retrieve memories\nof sleeping Pokémon using Dream Mist!\c\nThat's right! We can collect save files of\nTrainers from all over the world!\c
What's more, we learned that if you use\n[VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] to make a Pokémon sleep,\r\nit will have dreams.\c\nThen, when you wake up that Pokémon,\nits dream becomes the reality in a\r\nspace called [VAR FF00(0001)]Entralink [VAR FF00(0000)]in the middle of\r\nthe Unova region.\c\nIsn't Game Sync interesting?\nIf you like, please send your save file.\c\nI've summed up the details in the PC, so\nplease check it if you get a chance!\c
Fennel: [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] is fascinating, I think.\nDo you think so, too?\c\nIf you get interested, please send your\nsave file.\c\nI've summed up the details in the PC\nat the back.\r\nSo, please check it, if you'd like!
Fennel: Oh, thank you! \c\nYou also sent your save file. I saw it\nwhile I was researching Trainers!\c\nIsn't [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] great?

Amanita: Is there something you'd like\nto ask me?
In the Battle Box, you can register up\nto six Pokémon that you often use\r\nin battles.\c\nWhen you battle using Infrared\nConnection, you can choose to battle\r\nwith either your party Pokémon or with\r\nthe Pokémon in the Battle Box!

Oh! Trainer!\nDo you have enough Poké Balls?\c\nDon't be shy.\nTake this with you!\c

Cheren: When a Pokémon is poisoned,\nits HP decreases while it is battling.\c
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHave you come looking for the\nGym Leader?
He was here talking about Pokémon\ntypes until just a few moments ago...\c\nMaybe you walked right past him?\c
Nothing improves your skill as a Trainer\nlike real battles.\c\nThat's why challenging Gym Leaders is\ngreat practice.\c
By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)], will you have a\nbattle with me?\c\nI want to test how important items are\nin battles.
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)], will you have a\nbattle with me?\c\nI want to test how important items are\nin battles.
Really? I really want to try out my\nitems, so I'll just wait here until you\r\ndecide you're ready.
Cheren: Well, let's see how effective\nmy items are...\c\nOr maybe I should test how well I can\nbattle without items...?\c\nAnyway, this is an indoor match, so let's\nbattle without getting too rough!\c
Cheren: So learning to use items well is\ndefinitely important, then.\c\nOh, here. [VAR 0100(0000)], I'll give you\nthese Berries.\c
Cheren: If you give a Pokémon this kind\nof Berry to hold, it will eat it to heal up\r\nwhen its HP goes down in battle.\c\nBut if you give Pokémon man-made items\nlike Potions to hold, they can't\r\nuse them.\c\nWell, good luck, then.\c
This Trainers' School exists to meet the\ndemands of Trainers who want to know\r\nmore about Pokémon because they\r\nlove them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers\ncalled Abilities.\c\nAbilities have a variety of effects, and\nmany of those effects are activated when\r\nPokémon are in battle!
There is a technique that lets you\ncancel evolution!\c\nI'll read the book about it to you.\nAre you ready?\c\n“You can surprise a Pokémon and stop its\nevolution by pressing the B Button when\r\na Pokémon is evolving."
Some moves can only be taught with TMs.\c\nTMs can be used over and over, so you\nmight want to use them a lot.\c\nIf you don't like the move you taught,\nyou can always use a different TM.
Would you like to take a quiz about\nstatus conditions?
So here is the question:\c\nWhich of the following items\ncures poison?
Antidote
Parlyz Heal
Awakening
Ding ding ding!\c\nRight answer!\nNow for the next question.\c
The item that cures paralysis is\nParlyz Heal, but...\c\nWhich of the following items\nwakes up a sleeping Pokémon?
Ding ding ding! We have a winner!\nFantastic answer!\c\nSince you know so much about status\nconditions, I'll give you this!\c
Full Heal does exactly what the name\nsuggests--it heals all status conditions!
Come talk to me if you want\nto take a quiz.
Buzzzzz!\c\nToo bad... That's incorrect.\nPlease try again sometime!
The blackboard explains Pokémon\nstatus changes in battle.\c
What do you want to read about?
If poisoned, a Pokémon steadily loses HP\nwhen battling.\c\nThe poison lingers after the battle.\nTo cure it, use an Antidote.\c
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat\nand may prevent movement.\c\nIt remains after battle, so use a\nParlyz Heal.\c
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\r\nsleeping, it will stay asleep.\c\nWake it up using an Awakening.\c
A burn reduces the Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\c\nA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a Burn Heal.\c
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\c\nThe Pokémon may thaw out on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\r\nfrozen, it will stay frozen.\c\nThaw it out using an Ice Heal.\c

This skeleton is of a Dragon-type\nPokémon.\c\nThere's a theory that it had an accident\nwhile it was flying around the world, and\r\nso it became a Fossil.\c
This rock is amazing! It's a meteorite!\c\nIt contains some kind of energy\nfrom space.\c
Oh, this? It's an ordinary old stone.\c\nIt was found near the desert, but other\nthan the fact that it's old, it doesn't\r\nseem to have any value...\c\nWe only display it because it's rather\npretty to look at.\c
The Pokémon Gym is just beyond here.\c
At the end of the Gym, a very strong\nand kind Gym Leader is waiting.\c\nBy the way, the Gym Leader Lenora\nhappens to be my wife!\c
At the end of the Gym, a very strong\nand kind Gym Leader is waiting.\c\nBy the way, the Gym Leader Lenora\nhappens to be my wife!
Lenora: Now, you wait!\nEnough fooling around!\c
Team Plasma: So you've come, Gym Leader.\c\nWe, Team Plasma, claim this museum's\nDragon Skull in the name of\r\nPokémon liberation!\c
Team Plasma: To show you we're serious,\nwe'll steal it right before your eyes!\c
Team Plasma: Well, then, here's\nour smoke screen!\c
Plasmaaaa!
Plasmaaaa!
Lenora: What's going on?\c
Hawes: Oh! Oh! We have to go after them!\c
Hawes: Lenora loves that skull...
Bianca: I won't forgive those thieves!
Cheren: So I can't battle the Gym Leader\nbecause of Team Plasma, huh...\c\nWhat a bother.
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious...\c\nFrom the outside, you can't see their\nfunctional, efficient design.\c\nIt's almost as if it is an embodiment of\ntheir former essence... So fascinating!
Rare Pokémon from around the world...\nMuseums are packed with adventure!
My oh my oh my!
The Gym Leader here studies Fossils and\nancient artifacts.
Those thugs sure were bold...\c\nIt's almost as if they believe they are\ndoing the right thing.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came\nfrom space along with this meteorite.
What in the world could Team Plasma\nbe thinking?!
This is a skeletal specimen from a\nPokémon that flew around the world.
Part of the skeleton was stolen by\nTeam Plasma and is missing!
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was\nprotected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus\nattached to it.
An ancient round stone that was buried\nin the desert.
A plate with an unknown script carved\ninto it.
A mask that ancient people used to wear\nat festivals.
Bones that were once carried as weapons\nby a certain kind of Pokémon.

A Pokémon Gym where a Leader waits for\na challenger at the back of a museum...\r\nIt has a great atmosphere, doesn't it?\c\nSo... I will give this to you!\c
All Trainers in this Gym use\nNormal-type Pokémon.\c\nThis is just between you and me...\c\nNormal-type Pokémon are weak against\nFighting-type Pokémon.\c\nAround here, Fighting-type Pokémon\nshow up around Pinwheel Forest.\c\nNow, I will explain about the Gym itself!\c\nIn this Pokémon Gym, if you answer\nquestions hidden in books,\r\nyou can move forward.\c\nFor your information, the first book is\n“Nice to Meet You, Pokémon."\c\nIf you don't know where the book is,\nplease ask anyone!\c

Oh?\nAre you looking for a book?\c\n...I think “Nice to Meet You, Pokémon"\nis on a shelf near the entrance.\c
Hello, Trainer!\c\nYou've found a memo already, and you're\nlooking for a book about Pokémon?\c\nTee hee! In fact, I am also reading a\nbook about Pokémon. It's about Tepig.\c\nI wonder if the first Pokémon you met\nin this Gym was Tepig?
Tee hee! What a pity!\c\nThe first Pokémon you met in this Gym\nwas not Tepig!\c\nTry to remember the Pokémon you battled\nat the entrance of the Gym.\c\nThere's a hint on the bookshelf\nto the left!\c
Tee hee! OK!\c\nWhat was the Pokémon you battled\nat the entrance of the Gym?\c\nThere's a hint on the bookshelf\nto the left!\c
What was the first Pokémon you met\nin this Gym?\c\nThere's a hint on the bookshelf\nto the left!\c
You found the second memo, and you're\nlooking for a book?\c\n...What does the memo say?\c\n“Flame burns inside its body, and it\ngives off smoke from its head\r\nwhile it runs."\c\nI'm reading a book about Tepig, but\nis this book the correct answer?
Tee hee! What a pity!\nThis book about Tepig says:\c\n“It gives off flame from its nostrils.\nWhen it's not well, it can give off\r\nonly smoke."\c\nThat's slightly different from “it gives\noff smoke from its head while it runs."\c\n...The answer to this memo may not be\na living thing. Tee hee!\c
Wow! Great! That's correct!\c\nThe book that I am reading says:\c\n“It gives off flame from its nostrils.\nWhen it's not well, it can give off\r\nonly smoke."\c\nIt's slightly different from “it gives off\nsmoke from its head while it runs."\c\n...The answer to this memo may not be\na living thing. Tee hee!\c
“Flame burns inside its body, and it\ngives off smoke from its head while\r\nit runs."\c\nDid you figure it out?\c\n...The answer to this memo may not be\na living thing! Tee hee!\c
Have you already found the third memo?\nPretty good!\c\n...So, what does the memo say?\c\n“If you heat it up in a pot,\nit'll be delicious. What is this?"\c\nThe book I am reading is about Tepig...\c\nBut you don't think this book\nabout Tepig is the answer, do you?!
Oh, I know you're just kidding!\c\n...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen\nsweets made by heating up Berries.\c\nNow, what were they called?\c
Of course you don't!\c\n...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen\nsweets made by heating up Berries.\c\nNow, what were they called?\c
In the past, I've seen sweets made by\nheating up Berries.\c\nNow, what were they called?\c
...I'm wondering, did you see the last\nmemo and come to me?\c\nOK. I'll give you the last question!\c\n“Can you challenge the Gym Leader\nif you win against me?"
Tee hee! That is correct!\nWell, here we go, Trainer!\c
Hmmmmm...\nWhat a pity!\c\nI will tell you the answer\nif you win against me!\c
You'll meet the Gym Leader soon.\nThis is the last book.\c\nNow! Read the last book!\c
You'll meet the Gym Leader soon.\nThis is the last book!
Going through a maze in the\nlibrary and defeating the Gym Leader!\c\nYou...must be a very studious Trainer.
...Hmhm. I see.\c\nOh! The book I am reading now is called\n“The Structure of a Locomotive."\c\nIf you'd like to read this book,\nplease let me know.\c
...Hmhm. I see.\c\nOh! Did you find the memo and come here\nto look for this book?\c\nWhat does the memo say?\c\n“Flame burns inside its body, and it gives\noff smoke from its head while it runs."\c\nI'm reading a book called\n“The Structure of a Locomotive."\c\nIs this book the correct answer?
Oh!\nThat is correct!\c\n“Flame burns inside its body, and it gives\noff smoke from its head while it runs."\c\nThat's exactly how a locomotive looks!\nWell, I'll let you read this book.\c\nBut, before that...\c\nIt would be great for my research\nif we had a Pokémon battle.\c

Welcome!\c\nThe director of the Nacrene Museum\nand the Nacrene Gym's Leader\r\nis me! Lenora!\c\nWell then, challenger,\nI'm going to research\r\nhow you battle with the\r\nPokémon you've so lovingly raised!\c
Your fighting style is so enchanting.\nIt is charming.\c\nYou are a Pokémon Trainer\nworthy of receiving this Basic Badge!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nthe Basic Badge from Lenora!\c
If you have two Badges, traded\nPokémon up to Lv. 30 will obey you.\c\nHere, I also want you to have this TM.\c
Retaliate does a lot more damage if an\nally fainted the turn before you use it!\c\nIf you master the timing, you can defeat\neven strong opponents.\c
Some problems you can't solve even if you\nthink about them your whole life.\c\nSome problems have different answers\ndepending on the person.\c\nStill, the reason I can't keep my\ncuriosity down is this:\r\nI want to figure out the truth, but I\r\nalso have a desire for adventure!
Deeear!\c
Hawes: Dear! Come quickly!\c\nTeam Plasma is threatening to steal\nsome bones!\c
Lenora: What? What's going on?!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou come, too!\c
Lenora: Oh, it's you!\c\nAs always, you're raising your Pokémon\nwith a lot of love!\c\nBy the way, ol' Clay contacted me\nrecently.\c\nHe said you can find Pokémon Fossils\nin Twist Mountain!\c\nGo check it out if you like!

Hi, Trainer! Do you know a Pokémon\ncalled Audino?\c\nIt's a Pokémon that I sometimes find\nwhen I'm walking.\c\nIt jumps out of rustling grass.\nI can get a lot of Exp. Points.\c\nIt's kind of a friendly Pokémon, isn't it?
I heard that the Fossils in the museum\nwere found in Twist Mountain.\c\nThen, a person called Clay apparently\ndonated them to the museum.

Thanks again for your help.\c\nMy bug Pokémon are scurrying with\nexcitement about getting to battle you.\c\nLet's get straight to it!\c
Aww...\nI lost.\c\nWhatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me\nbecause you are a-MAZ-ingly strong!\c\nThis is the Gym Badge!\nYou beat me, so it's yours!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nInsect Badge from Burgh.\c
It's the Insect Badge!\nIt's insectible--I mean, incredible!\c\nIf you have three Badges,\nPokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey you,\r\nincluding traded Pokémon.\c\nBecause I'm a generous guy,\nI'll also give you this.\c
Struggle Bug also lowers the\nSp. Atk of the target that was damaged.\c\nI'm the best guy to tell you,\nit's the little things that count!
How many discoveries have you made\nsince you started your adventure?\c\nWhen I was a kid, my innocent heart was\ncaptured by the beauty of bug Pokémon.\c\nI drew with them and battled with them,\nand after all this time, I continue\r\nto discover new things.\c\nA world shared with Pokémon is a world\nswarming with mysteries.
Burgh: Heya!\nThis is what I do.\c\nI keep raising Pokémon and drawing\npictures inspired by the Pokémon I raise.\c\nIt's what I love to do. My life hums\nwith energy. What could be better?
When you step on the switch,\nthe one that pops out is--moi!\c\nOn that note, have a battle with moi!\c
Hiding makes battle instincts dull,\nyou know.
Now. Come. On.\c\nStep on this switch, and what happens?\nMoi!
Yeeeeeeeeah! Thank you for going\nto the trouble of calling me out!\c\nI'll channel my gratitude into my\nPokémon's moves and...\r\nmake sure it gets to you!\c
If you hadn't stepped on that switch,\nI'd still be stuck hidden away.\c\nThat's right! Bug Gym Trainers like to\nbe bugged!
Hiding beneath the floor, I understand\nhow a Bug-type Pokémon feels.
What do you think of Castelia City?\c\nI bet, with all of the bustling people,\nyou started feeling worn down on your\r\nway to the Gym!\c\nNever mind! This will help. Take it!\c

Cheren: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI just challenged the Gym Leader Burgh.\c
He's a seasoned Gym Leader.\nHe made me work for that Gym Badge!\c\nBut for me, Bug-type Pokémon\naren't much of a challenge.\c
I'm going to keep winning like this against\nall of the Unova region's Gym Leaders!\c\nThen, I'll head for the Pokémon League\nand outperform the Champion!\c\nIf I do that, everyone will admit\nwhat a strong Trainer I am...\c\nThat will make me feel truly alive...\c
Burgh: Ah hah!\c\nYou're the one who fought\nTeam Plasma in Pinwheel Forest...\c\nIf I remember, your name is...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nCome to challenge the Gym, I suppose?\c
Burgh: Ah hah!\c\nYou're the one who fought\nTeam Plasma in Pinwheel Forest...\c\nIf I remember, your name is...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nCome to challenge the Gym, I suppose?\c
Aww. Sorry, but could you wait a bit?\c\nI was informed that Team Plasma\nhas shown up!\c\nIn fact... Come with me!\nI'm going to the dock at Prime Pier!\c
Burgh: This is definitely the place.\c
Team Plasma: No one's here! Not a soul!\c\nNo other Team Plasma members, nor any\nof the Seven Sages, are inside.\c\n...If you think I'm lying, why don't\nwe have a little battle and find out?
Team Plasma: Don't scare me like that.\nCome on!\c
Team Plasma: I...had a thought!\c\nI'll take care of this weak-looking runt,\nso you can show off by handling\r\nthat tough-looking guy over there!\c
Think about how a Pokémon feels when\nit's being used by a pathetic Trainer!
What's your problem with\ntaking people's Pokémon?!
Burgh: Oh, please!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I'll leave that one to you!\c
Burgh: Oh, please!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I'll leave that one to you!\c
Burgh: Looks like our only\noption is to battle them and go on in.
Team Plasma: This is bad...\c\nBadbadbadbadbadbadbad!\c\nBad for Team Plasma!\nOr Plasbad, for short!\c\nIt's in my best interest to go\nreport to the Seven Sages right now!\c
Iris: Phew, we got lost.\c\nEven with directions from the\nXtransceiver, I couldn't figure it out!\c
Burgh: Team Plasma is inside.\c\nThe stolen Pokémon may be in\nthere as well.\r\nOK, I'm going in!\c
Iris: OK! This time, I'll join the fight!\c\nCome on, Bianca. You, too!\c
Bianca: W-wait!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You come, too!\c
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
[VAR 0100(0000)] picked up the Xtransceiver.\c
What Gym Leaders test is the strength\nof the bond between the challenger\r\nand his or her Pokémon!
Before challenging the Gym, you'll want\nto be sure you have enough Potions.
Being a Pokémon Trainer doesn't\nnecessarily make someone stronger.\c\nBut everyone can love their Pokémon\nand enjoy playing together.
I have six Poké Balls in my Bag!\c\nBut, really, what I want is\nGreat Balls and Ultra Balls!\c\nYou can't buy them at the Poké Mart\nuntil you've collected Badges, though.
My Pokémon is soooo cute!\c\nIt always makes me feel better\nwhen I come home!

Where did I put those sunglasses?\c
Ah, I found them.\c\nAnd you’ve really got to have more\nlight to see your way by. \c\nTake this--it’ll help you see in\ndark places.\c
Meow!\nHow did you find me?!\c\nYou are something else!\nSo, I'm going to give you something. This!\c
If you use the move Flash, the accuracy\nof the opponent's moves goes down.\c\nWhen you use it twice, the rate to get\nhit by a move will be about half.\c\n'Cause it means more light!\c

There's not a lot you can do alone.\nThere are more things two people can do.\c\nThere are even more things three people\ncan do!\c\nThat's right... I think what's missing\nfrom my dance is company.
Do you need something?\c\nWhat...?\nYou're looking for Dancers for a team?\c\nIt sounds very interesting, but I don't\nwant to do a favor for someone who isn't\r\nstronger than me.\c\nHey!\nLet's have a battle!
OK!\nLet's begin!\c
Hmmmm...
You're going to create a dance team,\naren't you?\c\nIt sounds very interesting.\nI'd like to join up!\c

It is small compared to a luxury liner,\nbut the size of a ship doesn't change the\r\nfeeling of adventure when you're out on\r\nthe open sea.\c

I've come to Castelia City to have a\ndance lesson!
What do you want?\c\nOh! The dance team! You're going to\nintroduce me to the team!\c\nOh! Then, before that, let's have a\nPokémon battle!

Burgh: Come on! This way!\c
Burgh: Team Plasma...\nThey took this young lady's Pokémon.\c
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], is there\nanything we can do? My Munna...\c\nTeam Plasma took it...\c
???: I heard this lady's scream and\nran after the thief as fast as I could.\c\nBut this city is so big and so crowded...\nI'm afraid I lost them.\c
Burgh: Iris...\nYou did everything you could.\c
Iris: But that's so bad!\c\nTaking people's Pokémon is really bad!\c\n'Cause it's really nice when\npeople and Pokémon are together!\c\nThey each have something the other\ndoesn't, and they help each other!\c
Bianca: Iris...\c
Burgh: Agreed!\nNo fear--we will get that Pokémon back.\c
Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
Having said that, finding a person or a\nPokémon here in Castelia City will be\r\nlike finding a needle in a haystack.\c
Team Plasma: I spy a Gym Leader?!\c\nLast time went so well, I thought\nI'd grab another Pokémon...\r\nRethinking...\r\nI need to get out of here!\c
Burgh: [VAR 0100(0000)], let's go!\c\nIris! You stay by that young lady's side.\c
Burgh: [VAR 0100(0000)], let's go!\c\nIris! You stay by that young lady's side.\c

Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour are\nPokémon that evolve with special stones!\c\nWhich Pokémon do you want to evolve?
Pansage...\nThen, it's a Leaf Stone you need.\c
Pansear...\nThen, it's a Fire Stone you need.\c
Panpour...\nThen, it's a Water Stone you need.\c
You might already know this, but I will\ngive you some advice!\c\nWhen a Pokémon evolves, it will be more\npowerful, but it will be slower to learn\r\na new move.\c\nThis is especially true for Pokémon that\nevolve with stones.\c\nSo, it's up to you: you can have it learn\na good move and then evolve it with\r\na stone, or evolve it with a stone fast\r\nand then have it learn a move with a TM!

All right, so it's Pansage?

Yes, that's true.\c\nIt's difficult to choose one.\nWhen you decide, let me know!

Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nIf you complete several survey\nrequests, you can advance in rank!\c\nIf you advance in rank,\npeople will look up to you, and\r\nyou can get something good!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are a B-rank statistician.\c\nYou advanced to the B rank!\nYou've been working hard.\c\nIf you advance in rank,\nyou'll get more new requests, so\r\nyou might want to talk to the leader.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are an A-rank statistician.\c\nYou're already in the A rank.\nThat's awesome!\c\nI also have to work hard\nand take surveys.\c\nI heard requests for the A rank\nwere difficult.\c\nKeep up the good work!

Good work today,\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nWe have more statisticians, and\nthis place has become quite lively.\c\nThe way things are going,\nwe can collect more survey data.
The more I conduct surveys,\nthe more fun it will be.\c\nI'm determined to pass by more people!\c\nIt's way more fun to conduct surveys\nwith people than doing them by myself.
By any chance, are you having trouble?\c\nIf it's difficult to pass by many people,\nI recommend you try a timed survey.\c\nIt takes time, but if you pass by just\none person, you can complete the\r\nrequest.
I'll give you a hint.\c\nIf you go to a place full of people,\nI recommend a head-count survey.\c\nYou can collect survey data really fast,\nso you can complete the request\r\nin a short time.
Good work today,\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nYou've become the top statistician\ninstantly.\c\nI should learn a lot from you\nand work hard!
When I answered a questionnaire earlier,\nI got a questionnaire sheet.\c\nMaybe I will answer all the\nquestionnaires...
After the questionnaire, the next step is\nconducting a survey.\c\nSet the request you want to survey\non the Survey Radar...\r\nAnd let's go!
New statisticians are not\nanswering questionnaires.\c\nIf they answered questionnaires,\nthey could conduct more surveys...\r\nWhat a shame!
Hello, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI've also started teaching novice\nstatisticians how to conduct surveys.
What is the popular movie now?\n[VAR 0100(0001)], do you have any idea?
What is the popular food now?\n[VAR 0100(0001)], do you have any idea?
What is the popular...\nOh, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nI knew it.\nI have to take a survey by myself...\c\nAh, it is a pain in the neck...
The survey requests from the leader\nare hard. Don't you agree?\c\nBesides, the number of more difficult\nsurveys are increasing...
Hello! Good work today, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nHave you finished all the\nsurvey requests from the leader?\c\nI heard if you finish all the requests,\nyou can get something good!
Oh! [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI'm honored to see you!\c\nOh, wow!\n[VAR 0100(0001)] spoke to me!

The Pokémon you chose is not the one\nI requested.\c\nWhat I want to paint is a Pokémon that's\n[VAR 0103(0000)] type!

I'm very happy, so I will give you\nanother present!\c

I disguise myself as a janitor because\nI like to know what kinds of Trainers\r\ncome here.\c\nI had a good time battling you.\c\nThis is a token of my esteem.\nPlease accept this!\c
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share gets\nsome of the Exp. Points from every\r\nbattle, even if it's not involved.\c\nThat's right! It may be useful\nfor raising weak Pokémon.

Look! As you can see, I opened it swiftly\nand with precision!\c\nInside the capsule...\nWhat your heart most desires...\r\na Technical Machine!\c
Hm. There's a letter with the\nTechnical Machine...\c
“I entrust the Technical Machine in the\nLock Capsule to a trustworthy Trainer in\r\nthe Unova region.\c\nDon't allow it to fall into the hands of\nvillains like Team Rocket..."\c
More is written here...\c\n“TM95 is Snarl.\nIt's a Dark-type Special Attack, and\r\nit lowers the opponents' Sp. Atk stat."\c\nSo that's what it is...a move that tests\nthe sense of the user!

The number of Trainers on the\nRoyal Unova today is [VAR 0200(0003)].\r\nAnd you've won against [VAR 0200(0004)].\c\nThe ship is nearing the port.\nWould you like to get off the ship?
The number of Trainers on the\nRoyal Unova today is [VAR 0200(0003)].\c\nThe ship is nearing the port.\nWould you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship!\nI would like to give you advice 'cause\r\nyou need help finding Trainers!\c\nDo you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long\nstories, and they just keep talking\r\nuntil they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation\ndeck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with\nblue doors for someone to battle,\r\nyou’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the\ncabins with blue doors today is [VAR 0200(0002)].
It's running on the ocean!\nWhat a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to\nthe observation deck or battle some\r\nTrainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves,\nbut it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing\nthe scenery from the deck...\r\nThis ship is the best!
I'm still wondering which cabin to enter.
I came here from Johto for business,\nbut everything is dynamic here.
Are you from Unova?\nI came here from Johto for business.\c\nAs I thought, a foreign region is\nso different! What's the difference?\c\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... so,\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\nWell, ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ... Don't you agree?\c
Oh! A whistle is blowing!\nSorry to keep you so long...\c\nBut it was fun to talk with you.\nThank you!
A battle break from work!\nIt is particularly fun.\c
I had a great battle on my break\nfrom work.
There are yet more Pokémon across\nthe water!\c\nThe excitement never stops!
I am having a relaxing time in this\nopulent cabin.
I heard that strong Trainers gather\nhere, so I came all the way from Sinnoh!\c\nLet me enjoy some Pokémon battles!\c
I can have Pokémon battles while\nI'm being rocked in the ship.\c\nPlus, I can see Pokémon that are rarely\nseen. I am soooo happy!
I heard a lot of Trainers in this ship\nare from the other side of the ocean.\c\nSpeaking of which, I am also from Kanto!
Did you go to the observation deck?\nYou can see an incredible view!
Having Pokémon battles while on the ship,\nbeing rocked by the ocean waves...\r\nIsn't it exciting?\c
I lost...\nMaybe I will go check out the view...
Cool! Cool!\c\nWhat is cool?\nThis ship! This ship!\c\n...Which part is cool?\nHmmmm... It's just cool!
A Pokémon battle!\c\nI thought about it, but...\nI don't have any Pokémon with me!
OK, Trainer! I will give you a practical\ndemonstration that I am not just some\r\nkid who wears shorts!\c
Argh! I lost!\nI take off my socks to you!
Listen! Listen!\nI love this ship 'cause I can\r\nbring my Pokémon on board!
Hey! Will you listen to my story?\c\nThe other day, I went to Nimbasa City!\c\n... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... I know, right?\r\nThen, ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... That's what I heard, anyway!\c
Oh! A whistle!\c\nI apologize for making you listen\nto my long story...\r\nBut it was fun talking to you. Thanks!
I am a Trainer.\nI came from a faraway region.\r\nI will show you my rarely seen Pokémon!\c
My Pokémon! Weren't they unusual?\nIn particular, Wormadam is my favorite!
This gorgeous ship suits a rich person\nlike me très bien. Am I right?
They blow a whistle five times!\nEven if I pretend I don't hear it,\r\nwhen they blow five times, it's the end...
I will show you a graceful battle\non this elegant ship!\c
Even if I lose the battle, I will not lose\nmy grace.\r\nThat's how a Rich Boy behaves.
Oh, their room service?\c\nI tried the specialty, Royal Unova tea.\nIt tasted wonderful!
The beautiful scenery outside the window\nis perfection, but I also like the royal\r\natmosphere inside the cabin.
With a few waltz steps, I will\nchoreograph a royal Pokémon battle!\c
I am enraptured with the royal\nPokémon battle...
From your standpoint,\nI am a Trainer from beyond the sea,\r\nand from my standpoint,\r\nyou are a Trainer from beyond the sea!
Oh, what a cute guest!\nWould you like a cup of tea?\r\nCome! Sit there and listen to my story!\c\n... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... but\r\nit ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ..., you see!\c
Sorry, sorry.\nI talked too much.\r\nIt was fun, though. Thank you!
Heh heh. A Pokémon battle?\c\nI got tired of relaxing in my cabin.\nWell, let's dance, Trainer!\c
You see two or three moves ahead.\nSure enough, I can't win against youth!
Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers?\nSorry, I don't know where to find them.\c\nBut the crew may know where they are.
Oh, look at you!\nWhat a cute guest!\c\nI could talk to you for ages.\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... exactly.\r\nThen, ... ... ... ... \r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... That's how it is!\c
Oh, my! The sound of a whistle!\nI am so sorry.\r\nI rambled on too much!
Hi there! You are such a cute guest.\nMay I have a Pokémon battle with you?\c
You're not only cute--you're also\nstrong in Pokémon battles!
Oh, I can feel the sound in my stomach!\nThe sound of that whistle is powerful!
You! Did you talk to me?\nYou came at the right time!\c\nI have a very funny story.\nI wanted to tell the story to someone.\c\n... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... That's the thing!\c\nThen, ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... ... ...\r\n... ... ... That's how it ends.\c
Oops. Did I talk your ear off? Sorry,\nsorry. But I had a great time. Thanks!
To look for someone stronger than me,\nI crossed over the mountains,\r\ncrossed over the sea, and came here.\c\nMy Pokémon are special because\nthey went through a lot of difficulties.\c\nNow, let's have a fair battle!\c
I can't believe you're stronger than me.\nI have traveled around the world!\c\nNow I understand...\nthe world is ridiculously big!


Today...\c\nAs for people, we have [VAR 0200(0000)] on the\nport side and [VAR 0200(0001)] on the starboard side.
Today...\c\nThe number of people on the starboard\nside is [VAR 0200(0001)], and...none on the port side.

Won against every Trainer on the ship!

A beautiful melody makes people happy.\nA sad melody makes people sorrowful...\r\nThat's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of\na long-ago melody from the fringes of my\r\nsepia-toned memories.\c\nIt was a song my mother loved...\nIt makes me feel so nostalgic.\c\nWould you like to hear the melody?\c
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that\nplayed a melody and danced so lightly\r\nthat it filled people's hearts with joy.\c\nThen sorrow darkened the entire world,\nand the Pokémon lost the melody...\c\nAlso, at that time, some red shoes\nwere lost somewhere...\c
When you came through the door,\nI remembered the melody!\c\nAnd the Pokémon that had forgotten how\nto dance began to step lightly once more!\c\nYou are the inspiration.\nYou are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song.\c\nAria Forme will become Pirouette Forme,\nand vice versa.
[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered\nthe Relic Song it had forgotten!\c


This is your first visit to this café.\nAm I correct?\c\nPlease...\c
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here.\nEnjoy...
After a tiring day of work, this café is a\nperfect spot to let your mind relax.
When I listen to his guitar, it reminds me\nof leaving home for the first time, and\r\nthe tears of farewell my mother cried...

Hello!\c\nIf you'd like, I will massage\nyour Pokémon.
Oh, I see.\nPlease see me if you change your mind.
All right! Let me get started.\c
Massage the Egg?\nIt may be a bit too early for that.
There. All done!\c\nThe massage has made your Pokémon\nmuch more friendly to you!
There. All done!\c\nThe massage has made your Pokémon\nmore friendly to you!
There. All done!\c\nThe massage has made your Pokémon\na little bit more friendly to you!
Sorry!\nI am exhausted from the massage earlier.\c\nPlease come back again tomorrow!
When Pokémon are happy, I am happy,\nand I laugh!\c\nWhen Pokémon see me laughing,\nthey will be happy, too!
Gahoohoo!
It's difficult to watch TV from here.\nIt's not your concern, though.

Check places you are curious about!\nYou may find some hidden items there.\c\nIf you use the Town Map item, you may\nfind a new place to explore!\c\nTalk to a person you are curious about!\nIt may be a wonderful encounter.
People in the past said wise things.\n“A child who sleeps well grows well."\c\nYes, if a Pokémon uses the move Rest,\nthe Pokémon will fall asleep and recover!\c\nI already taught the move to my Pokémon,\nso I will give this to you!\c
Even if a Pokémon falls asleep, I heard\nthere is a Berry to wake it up instantly.\c\nIf a Pokémon holds that Berry and uses\nRest, the Pokémon will fall asleep\r\nand recover, then wake up instantly!\c\nIt's a great combination!

Ghetsis: My word, if it isn't\nthe Gym Leader, Burgh.\c
Burgh: So, what would you say is the\nguiding principle of Team Plasma, anyway?\c\n“Take what you want from people"?\c
Bronius: I thought it would be amusing\nto prepare a hideout right in front of a\r\nPokémon Gym, but we were detected\r\nmore quickly than I imagined.\c
Ghetsis: Indeed...\c\nNo matter. We already have an\nexceptional base of operations.\c\nIs everyone familiar with the legend\nof the founding of the Unova region?\c
Iris: I am! It's the white\nDragon-type Pokémon, right?\c
Iris: I am! It's the black\nDragon-type Pokémon, right?\c
Ghetsis: The truth is this...\c\nThe white dragon appeared before a hero\nwho sought the true way to knit together\r\na world full of many warring people.\c\nThis white Dragon-type Pokémon shared\nits knowledge--and bared its fangs\r\nat those who stood against it.\c\nTogether, the power of this Pokémon and\nthe hero brought unity to the hearts of\r\neveryone in the land,\r\nand that is how Unova was created.\c
Ghetsis: The truth is this...\c\nThe black dragon appeared before a hero\nwho sought the ideal way to knit\r\ntogether a world full of warring people.\c\nThis black Dragon-type Pokémon shared\nits knowledge--and bared its fangs\r\nat those who stood against it.\c\nTogether, the power of this Pokémon and\nthe hero brought unity to the hearts of\r\neveryone in the land,\r\nand that is how Unova was created.\c
We shall bring back the hero and\nthat Pokémon to Unova once again!\c\nIf we can win people's hearts and minds,\nwe can easily create the world that\r\nI--I mean, Team Plasma--desires!\c
Burgh: Here in Castelia, we have\na lot of different kinds of people.\c\nEveryone's ways of thinking and\nlifestyles are very different.\c\nHonestly, there's something about what\nyou're saying I don't quite understand.
Yes?
What is it?
Burgh: One thing we all have in\ncommon is that we all care a lot\r\nabout Pokémon.\c\nEven people meeting for the first time\ncan talk about Pokémon.\r\nTalk or battle or trade...\c
Remember your speech at Accumula Town?\c\nYou were responsible for leading me to\nrethink my relationship with Pokémon.\r\nFor that, I thank you.\c\nAt that time, I made a promise...\c\nI swore to myself that I would dedicate\nmyself to Pokémon even more strongly!\c\nWhat you guys are doing... Aren't you\ngoing to strengthen the bond between\r\npeople and Pokémon even more?\c
Ghetsis: Myah-ha-ha-ha!\c\nYou are quite hard to figure out--a little\nmore intelligent than I'd expected.\c\nI am fond of intelligent people, you see.\nYou'll enjoy hearing about this...\c\nFrom every corner of the world,\nI have gathered knowledgeable people\r\nfor our king's benefit.\c\nYou could call them the Seven Sages.\c\nVery well! We will submit to your\nopinion and be on our way.\c
That girl over there...\nReturn her Pokémon!\c
Bianca: Th-thank you!\c\nMunny, I'm so glad to see you again!\c
Iris: Bianca!\c\nWhy are you thanking them?\nThey take people's precious Pokémon!\c
Bianca: It's just... I'm...I'm so happy\nthat my Munna is safe.\c
Ghetsis: The friendship between Pokémon\nand people can be very touching.\c\nBut, in order to liberate Pokémon from\nfoolish people, we will revive the legend\r\nof Unova--and win the hearts and minds\r\nof everyone. Farewell...\c
Iris: What are you doing?\nWhy are you letting them get away?!\c
Burgh: Gah!\c\nWhat do we do if anything's happened\nto the other stolen Pokémon?\c
Bianca: It's OK. Thank you, Iris!\c\nNo one was hurt. More than anything,\nI got my darling Pokémon back again!\c
Iris: OK, if you're happy...\c
Burgh: What is everyone\nplanning to do now?\c
Bianca: Oh, it would be sensational to\nlook around Castelia City, but...\c
Iris: Don't worry!\nI'll keep on being your bodyguard!\c
Bianca: Iris...\c
Burgh: Uh-hm. That's great!\c\nIris is a dazzling Pokémon Trainer,\nbut maybe not at home in the\r\nbig city yet.\c\nSo, a little give-and-take, hm! People and\nPokémon need to help each other out!\c
Iris: Also, thanks for looking\nfor the Pokémon!\c\nHere, this is for you!\c
Iris: Also, thanks for looking\nfor the Pokémon!\c\nHere, this is for you!\c
Iris: See you!\c
Wha...

Hello. Have you tried a Casteliacone yet?\c\nI managed to buy one on Tuesday, but\nit's very difficult to get!
Hey, Trainer!\nCheck out my moves!\c\nHave you gone to the next city yet?\nI learned this move at the\r\nmusical over there.\r\nPretty cool, isn't it?
Ohhhh! Your Pokémon are so charming!\c\nI want cute Pokémon, too, so I can\nuse this!\c
This move makes your Pokémon\nunbearably charming!\c\nAll Pokémon of the opposite gender\nwill fall in love!

Bianca: No way!\c\nI'm going to keep traveling\nwith [VAR 0100(0000)] and my Pokémon!\c
Bianca's Dad: Absolutely not! Others do\nthings their way, and we do things ours!\c
Bianca: Is that so?\c\nThen, how about you do things your way,\nand I'll do things mine!\c
Sweetie, you keep going on your travels.\c
Bianca's Dad: Hey! Who do you think\nyou are? This is a family matter!\c
My name is Elesa.\c\nI'm this town's Gym Leader.\nI also happen to be a model.\c
You know, there are many people\nin this world.\c\nThere are people whose way of thinking\nmay be completely different from yours.\r\nSometimes, this means you may get hurt.\c
Bianca's Dad: Of course!\c\nThat's exactly right!\nIt's because I'm worried about that...\c
Elesa: But it's important to keep trying,\nto learn about the differences between\r\nyourself and others...\c\nTo learn that being different is OK.\c\nAnd you shouldn't worry.\c\nTrainers always have Pokémon\nat their side.\c\nPokémon are wonderful. It's not only how\ncute they can be, but also how much you\r\ncan depend on them...\c
Bianca: Please!\c\nI know there's gonna be painful stuff\nlike you're worrying about!\r\nI know! Really, I get it!\c\nBut, like, listen...\nThere'll be tons of nice people, too.\c\nKnow what else? Since I've been\ntraveling with Pokémon, I've already\r\ngotten tougher, I can totally tell.\c\nSo...please?\c
Bianca's Dad: Hmm...\nI guess.\c\nIf wanting to continue your journey\nis selfishness on your part,\r\nwanting to stop you is\r\nselfishness on mine.\c\nI'm surprised to find I'm the one\nbeing childish--at my age!\c
This Gym Leader's comments helped me\nwake up.\c\nBianca, I'm sure it's better that you\ntake the path you want to take now.\c\nI hope that your journey will be fun.\nBon voyage!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], please...\nTake care of my little girl, OK?\c
Bianca: Papa, I'll come home after\nI find out what I really want to do!\c
Elesa: I'm sure he traveled\nas a Trainer himself, in the past...\r\nBeing a parent must be hard.\c
Did I meddle unnecessarily?\c\nYou looked troubled, so\nI decided to chime in.\c
By the way, if you're Trainers, please\nstop by the Pokémon Gym.\c\nI'll teach you a little something about\nhow tough a journey can get.\c
I'm sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI'll be waiting on Route 5.\c
Bianca: She's so cool! Hah!\nI want to be a totally cool woman\r\nlike Elesa!\c\nMm. I wonder how I'll get there.\c\nWell, before that, I guess I need to\ndiscover what I really want to do!\r\nSee you later, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c

Did the fantastic speed leave you dizzy?\c\nMy beloved Pokémon will be the next one\nto make your head spin!\c
My, oh my...\nYou have a sweet fighting style.\c\nI mean, you're a great Trainer!\nExcuse me, I...uh... Oh, here!\r\nI want you to have this!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nBolt Badge from Elesa!\c
If you have four Badges, including this\nBolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50,\r\nincluding traded Pokémon, will obey you.\c\nAlso, here's this move I like.\nFeel free to use it, um, if you want to.\c
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with\na different Pokémon after attacking.\c\nOf course, if you don't have another\nPokémon in your party, you can't switch.\c
You're going to Driftveil City next?\c\nOf course. There is a Pokémon Gym there,\nafter all. Oh...\c\nI bet you won't be able to get there.\nYou know what?\c\nI'll fix it so you can cross.\nWait for me on Route 5.
What you'd like to do...\nWhat your Pokémon would like to do...\c\nDon't you think it could be amazing\nif those are aligned?
Elesa: I think the real me is the one who\nbattles with Pokémon as a Gym Leader.\c\nA model's job is to make someone else's\nvision look like a reality.\r\nIt's interesting, but it's not easy...
Are you cool riding a roller coaster?\c
When you ride a roller coaster, the\nspeed can make you dizzy.\c\nI'm going to make your head spin with\na Pokémon battle that's just as intense!\c
Your way of battling...\nIt's elegant! You've got style!\r\nEven compared to Ms. Elesa!\c
If you press the switches, the\nroller coaster's path will change.
Your Nimbasa Gym challenge is finally\nnearing its finale.\c\nBut if you don't beat me,\nyou won't get to meet Ms. Elesa.\c
I'm also a Pokémon Trainer who was\ntoughened up by Ms. Elesa.\c\nI'll show you power and style befitting\nthis Gym.\c
It pleases me to be the opponent of a\nstrong and honorable Trainer like you!\c
If you maintain your calm and don't get\nflustered by this Gym's gimmicks,\r\nyou'll be able to defeat Ms. Elesa...\r\nand any other Trainer, as well!
[VAR 0100(0000)] pressed the switch.\c\nThe roller coaster's path\nhas been changed!
How about it? I can see you're surprised!\c\nWould you ever have guessed that\nthis Gym is a roller coaster?\c\nOK, let me fill you in...\nAnd take this, too!\c
In this roller coaster Gym, the first\nstep is to get in the car.\c\nNext comes the platform!\nThere, you can change\r\nwhere the coaster is going!\c\nSometimes you continue by riding\nthe cars of opponents you defeat.\r\nThat's how you aim for the Gym Leader!\c\nBy the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't\ndo well against Ground-type moves...
Elesa uses sparkling bright\nElectric-type attacks!\c\nBut the combination of you and your\nPokémon was even more impressive!\c\nIt was... It was...\nan emotional roller coaster!

The challenge was interrupted.
The selection was canceled.
Constant battles make me nervous.\nI'm taking a little rest here.
I'm going to save up Battle Points and\nget some items for my Pokémon to hold.
For each seven-win streak, the Trainers\nand Pokémon who challenge you become\r\nprogressively tougher.
I've decided to use only cute Pokémon!\c\nDo you have any unique thing you're\nparticular about?
OK! I'm all prepared!\nAll aboard for a battle journey!
Phew...I'm worn out.\c\nThese Trainers are tough. I wonder\nhow far I'll get with my skills.
Have you heard of the Subway Bosses?\c\nThey appear only to strong Trainers,\nand they challenge them to battles.\c\nThey are the Battle Subway's bosses.
That last battle was tough...\c\nI should've traded in my BP for a\nbetter item.
If you have wooon, the trip goes ooon!\nRelying on Pokémon, this vagabooond!
About time to take it to the next level.\nGive it your best shot, too!
The Trainers here are really tough\nfrom the very start.
My 42nd straight win...\nNot too shabby, eh?
Can't believe I won 84 straight...\nIs this a dream or a hallucination?
You've got a 14-win streak!\nPretty good! Not bad!
I hear the Super Train is endless!\c\nIn other words, if you keep winning, you\ncan keep going, on and on to wherever!
I can go a lot further!\nI can win a lot more!
The eyes of the Trainers here are very\nserious, or maybe you could say glinting.
Is this the best this officer can do...?\c\nThe light from the passing trains seems\nway too bright.
The Subway Boss was a suspicious,\nstrange fellow.\c\nI still don't believe he was giving it\nhis all.
Challenging people is also part of my\npolice training.
I can legally go as wild as I want!\nThis place! It's paradise, isn't it?
My journey has just started!\nNeither of us can afford to lose!
Being alone on the station's platform\nsomehow makes me feel a little sad.\c\nPeople leave on their journeys here, and\nit reminds me of those memories.
The Subway Boss was a piece of cake!\c\nMaybe I should cut loose on the\nSuper Train next time!
The Trainers sure have become stronger.\nI'm feeling a little uneasy...
It looks like my Pokémon skill has\nreached its peak power.\c\nI couldn't let go of my dreams...\nI'll hang them on you, stranger,\r\nyoung Trainer.\c\nAnd this is proof.\nPlease accept this, youngster...\c
I'm going to return to my home and\nquietly cheer myself up with art!
Oh ho ho ho...\c\nI've already done better than I did\nduring my last challenge!
Battle between two excellent Trainers is\nvery artistic.
For being called a Subway Boss,\nthat Trainer sure wasn't as strong\r\nas “Boss" suggests.\c\nIt was almost as if...\c\nAs if they are simply gauging\nhow strong we really are.
Well then!\c\nIt's about time to get on\nthe train!
Now just wait a minute, little Pokémon!\nI'll let you battle lots and lots soon!
Urk!\c\nI got motion sickness on the train...
You beat our boss, right?\nNot half bad, hey!\c\nAnd now, super Trainer, you've\nearned the qualification to take on the\r\nSuper Train!\c\nThe Trainers on the Super Train are\nreally tough.\c\nIf you want to know the essence of the\nBattle Subway, you should give it a try!
I'd rather have an exciting battle than\nslowly drive the train.
Where did you come from?\nAnd where are you going?
We Depot Agents are the protectors of\npeace and order in the station.\c\nWe are verrry opposed to littering on\nthe platform, shouting or playing\r\ninstruments, loitering, or any activities\r\nthat bother other people!
Just like how a machine needs fine-tuning,\nPokémon need maintenance, too.\c\nIt's a necessity.\c\nFor example, rethinking the moves that a\nPokémon knows.
No clumsy gimmicks...\nNo unnecessary items...\c\nThe only thing you can rely on is the\nstrength of you and your Pokémon.\c\nThis place is wonderful, isn't it?
Over 100 straight victories...\c\nIf this is all due to your strength,\nyou're even a match for the Champion.
The strength of the Trainers on\nthe Super Train is beyond imagination!
I had a taste of it...\nThe rush of battle...\c\nI shouldn't...\nIt's too wild...\c\nBut at this rate, I'm going to\nend up on the path of battlers...
Howdy! I'm a genius Pilot!\nUnova's finest!\c\nAnd I'm comin' in first here, too!
I've seen elite Trainers like me\nall over the place, but...\c\nSeems like the battles will be tough\nfrom here on.
Even for an elite Trainer such as myself,\nit's starting to get hard.
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
I've a-done it--77 straight wins!\nThat number has a lucky sound!
We've defeated over 300 Trainers...
My my, what a weak-looking Trainer...\c\nI think I would just get bored if I\nbattled you...\c\nI'll give you this, so just get a little\ntougher, OK?\c
I'm only interested in strong\nopponents...\c\nIf you get tougher, I wouldn't\nmind battling you.
Not many people left on the platform...\c\nGuess that shows how hard it is\nto keep winning on the Battle Subway.
...\c\nHuh? What? What do you want?\c\nI'm busy planning my tactics for my\nnext battle.\c\nI don't mean to be rude, but I really\nneed to concentrate. Would you mind\r\nnot talking to me right now?
91 straight victories is nothing more\nthan a natural result for me.\c\nMy glorious record will just keep\ngoing up!
You...\nYou have the same eyes as me.\c\nYou love battling so much...\nNo, it's not just that...\c\nBattling is your reason for living.\nYou and I are the same type, aren't we?\c\nSo...I'll give you this.\c
You're continuing your battle, right?\c\nThat's because we are that type of\nperson, aren't we...
I'm going to leave a rockin' record and\nturn into a big star!
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
There's more to Pokémon than it seems.\c\nThe world of Pokémon battling really gets\ndeeper and deeper.
I found this when I was cleaning.\nYou can have it if you'd like.\c
Oh, no need to thank me!\nAfter all, I just found it in the trash.\c\nI don't understand it. Recently, many\nfolks have just been throwing away\r\nperfectly good things.
I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot\nof confidence in my abilities!
All right! Bring out your Poké Balls!\nNow is the time for a battle!
You like battles, too!
I can't believe a Veteran like me\nwould get into trouble like that.\c\nWhere in the world are the Trainers\nhere training?
How are you doing, Trainer?\nAre you starting to get tired yet?
Mumble, mumble, mumble...\c\nIn order to bring good fortune, I always\nthink about my family before a battle.
I've been watching you battle.\c\nNice technique and judgment... Not\nsurprising, after a win streak like yours.
Not many people around.\c\nBut each person who is still here has\nshown true strength.
Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler\nif they get careless.\c\nPokémon battling requires that you\nalways be on guard.
Just a little more to 50 straight wins!\nSuddenly, I'm all pumped up!
You have the face of someone who\nabsolutely loves Pokémon battling.\c\nEven now, you're still completely hooked\non battling. Amazing.\c\nHee hee...\nYou have a promising future!
You and I both have 91 straight wins!\c\nWhich of us will reach a 100-win\nstreak first?
Dawn and dusk behind my battles...\c\nThe rocking train softly rattles...\c\nHow many hours have now passed\nsince we left Nimbasa in the past?
This is the end of the line...\c\nThe trip sure ended quickly.\nI don't want to go home yet.
If you've made it this far, that means\nyou've won 14 in a row.\c\nWhat a fluke! Fourteen is how old I am!\c\nHa ha ha...
I'm going to let people know I'm still\nas active as ever!
It's the end of the line already...\c\nI guess that means my Pokémon\nbattle journey is over for now.
Phew...\c\nThis long journey is hard on this\nold body.
Hmm. You've got 28 straight wins, huh?\c\nThis time, I want to keep going\nwith this momentum.
You also beat the Subway Boss, right?\nSomeday I want to battle you, too!
When my favorite Poké Ball begins\nto shake, I tremble with excitement!\c\nYou're no ordinary Trainer, are you?\nPerhaps you are the Champion somewhere?
Winning battles feels good, but I've\ntraveled quite far...I wonder if I can\r\nget back in time for work tomorrow...
I finally have a 49-battle win streak.\c\nIf I can do this well at work, I wonder\nif I can get promoted...
Both you and I have won more than\n100 straight battles!\c\nI may have too much time on my hands,\nbut so do you.\c\nTake this to commemorate our meeting of\ntwo similar people!\c
It's a really precious Berry, but I don't\nknow how to use it other than to eat it\r\nas a snack...
It's a subway map of the Unova region.\c

Bianca: A. Mazing. Isn't it?\c
Hello, you two! How do you do?\c\nI'm the owner of this theater.\nPleasure to meet you!\c
Ooh! I must say that you two seem like\nphenomenal Trainers!\c\nWhat do we do here? We use Props to make\nyour Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!\c\nDo you want to join in and play Dress Up?\nTo get you started, here's a Prop Case!\c
This Prop Case lets you store Props for\ndecorating your Pokémon!\c\nFirst off, you need to pick a Pokémon!\c
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't\nplay Dress Up. Please choose a\r\ndifferent Pokémon next time.\c
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing\nyour Pokémon's innate charm by choosing\r\nnot to decorate it!\c\nHonestly, though, I think using Props\nwould be better received in this musical.\c
Now, now. Don't be like that.\nPlease reconsider and select a Pokémon!\c
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!\c
Wow! The two of you did a fantastic job\ncoordinating everything!\r\nUtterly charming!\c
If you have a Pokémon who can play\nDress Up, you can participate in the\r\nPokémon Musical!\c\nWould you two please join us?\nThe receptionist can explain everything.\c\nLet us say a brief farewell!\nI eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!\c
Bianca: Oh, I don't know what to do!\c\nDoing the musical would be totally cool,\nbut there's other stuff I wanna do.\c\nOK, that's it! I made up my mind!\nI'm going to see the sights in Nimbasa!\c\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
We really want you to participate in\nthe musical!\c\nI apologize in advance if any of our\nProps don't suit some kinds of Pokémon.\c\nPokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait!\c\nYou participated in a musical\nwith your friends, right?\c\nI felt like you opened up new possibilities\nfor musicals!\c\nThat's why I feel impelled to give you\nthis present! Please accept it!\c
I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!
Your continued participation makes me\na happy owner!\c\nYou're attracting a lot of attention as\nan up-and-coming stylist.\c\nOf course, I'm watching you closely,\nas well.\c\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy appreciation.\c
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!\c\n...Actually, it feels like I've said this\nline before.\c\nWell, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation\nmakes me a happy owner.\c\nApparently, some audience members have\nbeen calling you a top stylist as of late!\c\nBest of all... How impressive am I for\nrecognizing your talent?\c\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy gratitude!\c
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday!\nI've got this festive Prop to give you!\c\nIt's a cake from me, the owner!\c\nOf course, this is a Prop, so you should\nattach it to your Pokémon and not eat it.\c\nBy the way, even if today isn't your\nbirthday, I won't take it back!\c\nWhy?\nBecause I'm the owner!\c
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous\nthan ever before, so I'm researching the\r\nstyles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up\nthere today!\c\nOverall, totally [VAR 0123(0000)]!\c\nThe [VAR 0123(0001)] Prop\nwas a great accent.\c\nI noticed that your [VAR 0123(0002)]\nfactor was a bit subdued today.\c\nOK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the\nshow you're performing in is im-por-tant!\c\nIf it's a good match, you can win the\nhearts of the audience!\r\nYou'll be sure to attract attention.\c\nIf you're going to get on stage,\nit's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image:\ncool, cute, elegant, or quirky.\c\nBefore you play Dress Up, take a moment\nto think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're\nrather rich.\c\nWhen you say rich people, you think\nmusical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have\nplayed Dress Up with their Pokémon\r\nwith such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful!\nI'm always watching them.\c\nI hope you can keep entertaining us with\nyour performances.
I always make sure to watch the\nshows you participate in!\c\nEven from the perspective of a rich man\nlike me, it's impressive!\c\nIt's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from\nlast time!\c
You can hang Musical Photos from your\nprevious shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon,\nmy eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this\nMusical Theater.\c\nOne time, a Pokémon wandered up on\nstage and started imitating the actors.\c\nEverybody thought it was sensational!\nTa-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people\nwill become your fans and give you Props.\c\nI don't have any Props, so I'll give you\nthis instead!\c
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is\nboosted more and more if it's used\r\nevery turn.\c\nHaving a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep\nparticipating in the musical, and keep\r\nusing Echoed Voice!\c\nYou'll make more fans in the musical, and\nyou'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater\nProps + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance,\nbut I think you belong on the\r\nspectacular stage!

[VAR 0100(0000)]'s Dress Up performance\nwas very distinctive!\c
In this musical, it's not an\noverstatement to say that [VAR 0100(0000)]'s\r\nPokémon was the lead role.\c
The Pokémon used Props to convey such\nabundant expression, just as if they\r\nwere actors!\c
Watching your Pokémon's sharp moves,\nI also felt [VAR 0123(0001)]!\c
Your Pokémon played its role very well.\c
It looked like your Pokémon was making an\neffort to live up to your expectations.\c\nI will support your Pokémon on the side!\c
It was not highly noticeable...\nBut I liked it! Keep it up!\c
Thank you very much for participating in\nthe musical today!\c\nPlease join another musical again!\nHave a great day!\c

I've trained and built up my muscles\nby tackling Pokémon!\c\nNothing can move me!
OK! I will defend to the end with moves\nlike Protect and Detect!
My favorite moves?\c\n...Hmm.\nI'd say Tackle and Take Down.
Reading your opponent's attack and\ndeciding your next move...\c\nBoth Pokémon battles and football have\nthe same thrill!
The appeal of football?\nLet me see...\c\nFirst, just watch a game without thinking\nabout the rules!
I'll protect my team with my whole body\nto avoid our opponents' interference!
In football, the quarterback is the\nathlete who decides a strategy and\r\ncarries it out.\c\nHe's kind of like a Pokémon Trainer!
In football, you have to learn each and\nevery formation by heart!
The ball used in football is oval-shaped\nand hard to throw, isn't it?\c\nBut once you get the hang of it, you can\nthrow it perfectly!
I am a greeeeeat secret weapon!\c\nThe only problem is, I am so secret that\nI've never been in a game...
Yoo-hoo! Pass me the ball!

When I was a kid, I played catch with\nmy Pokémon!
It's not bad to grow up.\c\nBut it's bad to forget what it felt like\nto be a child.
I have baseball, and I have Pokémon...\nHow happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit\na ball.\c\nIf you don't do things, you won't fail...\nbut you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the\ntime! That is the only thing I can do.

Everybody makes mistakes.\c\nBut goalkeepers cannot afford a mistake,\nbecause they cannot score goals to make\r\nup for it.\c\nIf one Pokémon on a team makes a\nmistake, however, the other Pokémon\r\nand their Trainer can cover for it!
If a Striker catches a teammate's eye,\nthey understand each other.\c\nA Pokémon and its Trainer are the same.\nDon't you agree?
Really strong Trainers thoroughly do\nwhatever they can do!
Soccer is beautiful and fun!\nPokémon are also beautiful and fun!
Soccer with Pokémon is Pokémon soccer.\nThe abbreviation is...Poccer?

Oh, my goodness. Your [VAR 0101(0001)] can\nuse [VAR 0107(0000)]!\c\nYou went to all the trouble of teaching\nit to your Pokémon? That's so touching!\c\nThis is a small token of my appreciation.\nPlease don't hesitate to accept this.\c
I wonder what [VAR 0107(0000)] looks like\nwhen it is actually used.\c\nI am sure you can use it skillfully!

Oh! Hey!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c
Let me see your Pokédex for a moment.\c\nWhat do we have here?\c\nSo, you've found [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon, eh?\c
Staggering! You've seen a Klink!\nYou're becoming quite the Trainer.\c
Hmmm...\nYou haven't seen a Klink yet, eh?\c\nStill, that's a great Pokédex!\c
Excuse me! I was a little excited\nand forgot my manners.\c\nMy name is Juniper, too! Cedric Juniper.\c\nHeh! The professor who gave you\nthe Pokédex is my daughter!\c\nThat girl has told me a lot about you.\c\nIt really makes my day to meet you!\c
In honor of our meeting,\nI'm going to upgrade your Pokédex!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]'s Pokédex has\nbeen upgraded!
Cedric: Some Pokémon can change forms\neven when it's the same individual.\c\nIf you have already seen a form, you\ncan check it with this whenever you want.\c\nI also added a function to make\nsearching easier.\c
???: Professor, who's that Trainer?\c
Cedric: Oh! I forgot my introductions!\nSkyla, this is a friend of my daughter's.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is traveling around\nUnova to complete the Pokédex.\c
Skyla: Oh, I see! So that means you'll\nbe challenging the Gym!\r\nOh boy! I'm really looking forward to it!\c
Cedric: That's right, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou should challenge this Gym!\c\nIf nothing else, this Gym\nis really out there!\c
See you, Skyla. If something comes\nup again, I'll let you know!\c
Skyla: Professor, my plane\nis a cargo plane!\c\nIt carries cargo, not people!\c\nAnd you're talking as if places like Kanto\nand Sinnoh are right around the corner!\c
Cedric: Aww, Skyla.\nIf you keep frowning, your face might\r\nfreeze like that, and that'd be a shame.\c\nPeople and Pokémon, we all have\nto help each other out!\c\nSee you later!\c
Skyla: Sheesh!\c\nIt's hard to believe a happy-go-lucky\nguy like that could be a world-renowned\r\nPokémon professor.\c
Heads-up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAs a Gym Leader, I'd be happy to have\nyou challenge the Gym, but there's\r\nsomething I need to take care of first.\c
Heads-up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAs a Gym Leader, I'd be happy to have\nyou challenge the Gym, but there's\r\nsomething I need to take care of first.\c
Just now, as I was flying the\ncargo plane, I saw something\r\non top of the Celestial Tower.\c
I'm sure that it is a sick Pokémon!\nIf it is, I can't just leave it there!\c\nI have to look into this right away.\c\nI'm leaving for Route 7's Celestial Tower.\nYou can come along if you want.\c
Skyla completed her cargo-plane run.\nShe must have gone somewhere after.\c\nMaybe to the Celestial Tower on Route 7?
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]They may say it is for understanding\none another better, but what Trainers\r\nreally use battles for is to compete...\r\nAnd they hurt each other's Pokémon!\c\nAm I the only one who finds this\nterribly painful?\c\nWhatever...\nI'm going to talk to your Pokémon.\c\nI've been living with Pokémon\nsince I was born, so it's easier for\r\nme to talk with them than with people.\c\n...Because Pokémon never tell lies.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Hey, [VAR 0101(0000)].\c\nWould you tell me what kind of Trainer\n[VAR 0100(0001)] is?[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]OK, OK, got it.\c\nSo [VAR 0100(0001)] was born in Nuvema Town,\nlives with Mom, and was given the Pokédex\r\nto start off a journey to see the world.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Still, this [VAR 0101(0001)] trusts you\nfor some reason. That's good!\c\nIf every person and Pokémon cared about\none another like you two do,\r\nI could watch over the future of people\r\nand Pokémon without having to liberate\r\nPokémon from people who just use them.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Ghetsis is using Team Plasma\nto search for some special stones--\c\nthe Light Stone and the Dark Stone...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]These stones hold the essence of two\nlegendary Pokémon. It is said that when\r\nthey lost their physical form, they fell\r\ninto a slumber and were transformed.\c\nNow, they wait for the hero's arrival...\c\nI shall resurrect a legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon from one of\r\nthese stones, and become its friend.\c\nThat will show the world that\nI am the new hero.\r\nEveryone will follow what I say![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]My vision is to change the world\nwithout using force.\c\nTrying to change the world by force\nwill just make others resist.\c\nIf people resist, the ones that will be\nhurt are the innocent Pokémon\r\nused by foolish Trainers.\c\nYou understand.\c\nPokémon are not just tools\nfor people to use![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]As a result...\c\nPokémon and Trainers who care about\none another, like you and your Pokémon,\r\nwill be separated.\r\nAnd that does break my heart a little. [VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Planes! Their shapes!\nThey are perfectly designed to fly!\c\nThere is no excess in the\nmechanics for flying!
The only planes that fly out of\nMistralton Airport are cargo planes.\c\nIf Trainers want to fly, they can go\nwith a Pokémon that knows the move Fly.
Skyla's grandfather was\na legendary Pilot.\c\nSkyla is our city's Gym Leader.\nShe's a really nice person!
Pokémon and people worked together\nto open up desolate land and make\r\na place where everyone could live.\c\nI'm certain that this cooperative\nspirit will remain unchanged.
It's dangerous to play in a landing strip,\nbut you should be OK on ours.\c\nWe only have one cargo flight a day.
I hear many people have had their\nPokémon stolen by Team Plasma...
If you want to eat delicious vegetables,\nthe ones grown in the wild are the best.\c\nAs the weather and the seasons change,\nwild vegetables get more and more tasty.\c\nEven Pokémon like to eat wild vegetables!
Vegetables grown in a greenhouse\nare the best.\c\nThe temperature and their nutrients\nare all managed systematically.\c\nVegetables grown in a completely\nefficient way taste extra delicious!
Oh! You found our treasure!\c
Found it!\c
Just kidding.\c\nWe don't have a Pokémon, so we planned\nto hide this TM until we got one.\c\nBut that would be a waste, so--here!\nYou can use it!\c\nWe'll get another one from Skyla.\c

Hee-hee!\nI've been waiting for you.\c\nDid you enjoy flying with the help of\nthe Mistralton Gym cannons?\c\nThey're my pride and joy!\c\nThis time, let's try something else!\c
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer.\c\nMy Pokémon and I are happy,\nbecause for the first time in a while,\r\nwe could fight with our full strength.\c\nThis is an official League Gym Badge.\nI think it will look good on you.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nJet Badge from Skyla.\c
Wow, hot stuff!\c\nWith that many Gym Badges,\nPokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you.\c\nAlso, as thanks for a Pokémon battle\nthat made me very happy,\r\nI want you to have this TM.\c
My present to you is Acrobatics.\nIf the user doesn't have a held item,\r\nits power doubles.\r\nIt's a pretty technical move.\c\nBe sure to compensate for the\nlack of a held item!\c\nBy the way, when I flew over\nTwist Mountain on the way\r\nto Icirrus City...\c\nTeam Plasma--is that the name?\nAnyway, they were heading for the city.\c\nWhat kind of people are they?
Icirrus City, where you'll find the next\nGym, is past Route 7, just after you\r\ncross Twist Mountain.\c\nIt's a hop, skip, and a jump when flying,\nbut it's a really challenging walk.\c\nHeads up! Make sure you're ready for it!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well?\nOur battle together was so much fun.\c\nNow, my Pokémon and I have started\ntraining again.\c\nI don't usually let people travel in my\ncargo plane, but battling with you was\r\nsuch a blast that I'd make an exception.
Please take this Fresh Water!\c
Just between you and me...\c\nRock, Electric, Ice... Flying types have\nmore weaknesses than people know about.\c\nIf you use Pokémon and moves of those\ntypes, victory is practically yours!\c\nBy the way, to proceed in this Gym,\nyou climb in the cannons to move forward.\c\nThe cannons go up, down, left, and right.\nYou can get in them from anywhere!
Woo! Not many people look that good\nbeing shot out of a cannon...\r\nYou make it look easy!\c\nAnd congratulations on your victory\nagainst the Gym Leader.

When a Pokémon learns the move\nHidden Power, somehow I can tell\r\nwhat type that move will be!\c\nShould I tell you what type of\nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power,\nI can tell you what type of Hidden Power\r\nyour Pokémon will learn!\r\nDo you want to know?
If this Pokémon were to learn\nHidden Power, the move's type\r\nwould be [VAR 0103(0000)]!
The type of this Pokémon's\nHidden Power would be [VAR 0103(0000)]!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll\nactivate my hidden power for you!

I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn\nto use Hidden Power.

When you use the move Fly, you can\nreturn to a Pokémon Center\r\nyou've already visited.\c\nBut if Pokémon don't know their\ndestinations, they cannot fly there!
Because I know a lot about planes,\nI can maintain them!\c\nBecause I know a lot about Pokémon,\nI can be strong!
For the places that I cannot reach,\nI ask Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon\r\nfor help sometimes.\c\nI cannot even imagine everyday life\nwithout Pokémon.
Chulululuwa!
Because of this control tower, planes\ncan fly safely in the sky where there\r\nare no roads.\c\nFrom that, I take this lesson:\nIf Trainers lead Pokémon correctly,\r\nPokémon will feel safe and fight well.
My dream was to become a Pilot and\nfly away, far away...\r\nI still have that dream in my heart.
Welcome to the sky city, Mistralton!\nTake this as a keepsake!\c
If a Pokémon holds an item called\nSharp Beak, its Flying-type\r\nmoves will be powered up!

The legendary Pokémon Reshiram\nshared its wisdom with the hero\r\nand defied foes with columns of fire.\c\nThe hero and that Pokémon were as\nclose as a parent and child.\c\nPeople were filled with awe and looked up\nto them, and that is said to be the\r\nbeginning of what became ancient Unova.

You've raised it well.\nYou must be affectionate.\c
I see! Although it's just a smidgen,\nI can feel your love for your Pokémon.\c
That is a token of gratitude for showing\nme your great love for your Pokémon!
Well, you showed me good stuff!\c\nPlease keep raising your Pokémon\nwith loving care!
What? It has not grown at all.\c\nStill, if you travel with your Pokémon\nfrom now on, I am sure it will grow!
Welcome to the Pokémon Fan Club.\c\nShall I check how friendly your Pokémon\nis toward you?

I can't tell whether or not you and\nthe Egg are close friends.
Oh, my. Your [VAR 0101(0000)]...\c
It is super friendly to you!\nI'm a bit jealous!
It is quite friendly to you!\nYou must be a kind person!
It is friendly to you.\nIt must be happy with you.
It is a little friendly to you...\nThat's what I'm getting.
The relationship is neither good\nnor bad... It looks neutral.
Hmmm...\nIt may not like you very much.
By any chance, you...\c\nAre you a very strict person?\nI feel that it really doesn't like you...
Oh, you are so shy! Come on,\ndon't hide your Pokémon from me.
Muuun!

Alder: Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThis way.\c
Ghetsis... What a liar.\c\nDesperately trying to con\neveryone with his speech.\c
That's correct!\c\nOur lord N has combined his power with\nthe legendary Dragon-type Pokémon\r\nand intends to create a new world.\c\nWe herald the return of the hero of\nUnova, founder of this region.
Hero?
Dragon?
Legend!
Pokémon are different from people.\c\nThey are living beings who contain\nunknown potential.\c
They are living beings from whom we\nhumans have much to learn.\c
They are beings whose greatness we\nshould acknowledge!\c\nBeings who should be freed\nfrom our oppression!
Freed?
Pokémon?
We, Team Plasma, invite you to join us!\c\nWe all want to create a new world where\npeople and Pokémon are both free!\c\nLadies and gentlemen, I ask you now...\nPlease, release your Pokémon.\c\nAnd so I end my plea to you today.\c\nThank you one and all for your attention.\c
Is it true?\c\nHave we been making Pokémon suffer?\c
Hmm...\c\nMaybe we should release our Pokémon\nlike Team Plasma says...\c
No way!\c\nWithout Pokémon, I'll be lonely and sad!\c
What was that about?\nThat speech was off-the-charts strange!\c
The cooperation of people and Pokémon is\nhow Unova came to exist to begin with.\c\nIf a Pokémon really didn't want\nanything to do with humans,\r\nit would simply leave...\c\nCapturing a Pokémon in a Poké Ball\ndoesn't mean you've captured its heart.\c
Alder: Let's go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Alder: It's been a while, Iris\nand Drayden.\c
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder!\n...And the guy who helped out that time.\c
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder!\n...And the girl who helped out that time.\c
Drayden: What's wrong?\c\nWhat does the wandering Champion who\nleft the Pokémon League need from us?\c
Alder: Briefly, my request is this.\c\nTell us about the legendary\nDragon-type Pokémon!\c
Iris: Are you talking about Reshiram?\nOr Zekrom?\r\nWhat's the sudden interest?\c
Iris: Are you talking about Zekrom?\nOr Reshiram?\r\nWhat's the sudden interest?\c
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker\nknown as Ghetsis was here.\c\nHe said a Trainer named N has\nreawakened Reshiram...\c
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker\nknown as Ghetsis was here.\c\nHe said a Trainer named N has\nreawakened Zekrom...\c
Alder: Yes!\c\nThat Trainer called N apparently told\n[VAR 0100(0000)] here to search for the\r\nother Dragon-type Pokémon!\c
Drayden: Let me check that I have\nthis straight.\c\nThis N, or what have you, presumes\nto set the two Dragon-type Pokémon\r\nagainst each other in battle\r\nto test his convictions?\c
Iris: Oh, no!\c\nThe Dragon-type Pokémon\nget along so well!\c
Alder: That's right, Iris.\c\nThe ones who make Pokémon battle\nare the Trainers...\c\nAnd it's so the Trainers and the Pokémon\ncan get to know each other better.\c
I'm going to the Pokémon League.\c\nNo, I guess in this case I should say I'm\n“returning" to the Pokémon League!\c\nOf course, I'll defeat N!\c\nI'll teach him about the beauty of this\nworld, where Pokémon and Trainers\r\nlive together in harmony!\c\nAlso, [VAR 0100(0000)], I'll await your arrival.\c\nOnce you've obtained the Opelucid Badge,\ncome to the League!\c\nThe Opelucid Gym Leader is tough.\nTake care!\c
Farewell.\nI'm counting on you, Drayden and Iris!\c
Iris: Aww...\nHe's gone.\c\nIs he OK?\nHe looked kinda scary.\c
Drayden: Don't worry, Iris.\c\nHe is the strongest Trainer\nin all of Unova.\c
Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], is it?\nCome to my home.\c\nAs Alder asked, I'll tell you\neverything I can about the\r\nlegendary Dragon-type Pokémon.\c\nIris, child, please show the way.\c
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City,\nI can take you anywhere.\c\nAs for the story of Reshiram and Zekrom,\nwe'll tell you all we know about it!\c\nThis way!\c
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City,\nI can take you anywhere.\c\nAs for the story of Zekrom and Reshiram,\nwe'll tell you all we know about it!\c\nThis way!\c
Iris: That way!\c
Iris: Just a little farther!\c
Iris: This is it!\c
A challenger?\c\nI'm sorry, but currently,\nour Gym Leader is at home.
If all Pokémon are released, Trainers and\nGym Leaders will no longer exist.\c\nFor better or worse, the world\nwould surely change...
The memories of everyone who has lived\nin this city have built up over the years\r\nwithout changing much.
This city changes endlessly.\c\nAnd every change is engraved in the\nmemories of the people who live here.
I spent so many happy days training my\nPokémon as we grew stronger together...\c\nIf it will make my beloved Pokémon\na perfect being, however,\r\nI can't help but let it go.
Even if it is inconvenient, I think\nsome things shouldn't be changed.
Even if you love them, I think\nsome things have to be changed.
Hey hey! That person called N had the\nlegendary Pokémon with him, so he has\r\nto be the legendary hero, right?\c\nHe's going to change the world, isn't he?
I like older things better than new ones.\nThey're just more relaxing!
I like newer things better than old ones.\nThey're just so cool!
...No way! Without Pokémon, I'll be too\nlonely and sad!\c\nBut am I only using my Pokémon, then...?
The Gym Leader Iris is still a child, but\nthe mayor Drayden has recognized\r\nher power!
The Gym Leader Drayden is the mayor who\nleads Opelucid.\c\nHe is always training by wrestling\nwith Pokémon.
So, have we really been making\nour Pokémon suffer...?
Yes, I will keep moving forward together\nwith my Pokémon.\c\nEven if I were to part ways with my\nPokémon, it wouldn't be because someone\r\nelse said to, but because we decided to.
I'll definitely keep moving forward\ntogether with my Pokémon.\c\nI won't take their company for granted.\nI'll appreciate how amazing that is!
The legendary Pokémon is the symbol\nof Unova.\c\nDoes that mean Team Plasma is right?\n...I don't know.
Pursuing ideals is different from person\nto person and Pokémon to Pokémon.\c\nIn this city, it seems the ideal is\nto cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different\nfrom person to person and\r\nPokémon to Pokémon.\c\nIn this city, it seems the truth is\nconstant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put\ninto this melody...\c\nI will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody...\nI will send them to the future.
Professor Juniper: ...Hello!\nHow was Iris doing?\c
Professor Juniper: ...Hello!\nWas Drayden as tough as ever?\c
Oh, I came to report on how to\nresurrect the legendary Zekrom.\c\nI thought it would be better to tell you\nin person than over the Xtransceiver.\c\nAnd as for the conclusion...\nWell, I haven't figured it out yet.\c\nI'm sure the Pokémon will wake up\nwhen it deems someone worthy.\c
Oh, I came to report on how to\nresurrect the legendary Reshiram.\c\nI thought it would be better to tell you\nin person than over the Xtransceiver.\c\nAnd as for the conclusion...\nWell, I haven't figured it out yet.\c\nI'm sure the Pokémon will wake up\nwhen it deems someone worthy.\c
More importantly, aren't you amazing!\c\nYou have all eight of Unova's Gym Badges\nnow, right?\c\nYou've become so strong!\c\nYou probably don't even know it, but\nyou've changed a lot since you left\r\nNuvema Town.\c\nWell then, I'll show you where such a\nstrong Trainer should head next!\c
Professor Juniper: Pass through that\ngate, go down Route 10, and you'll arrive\r\nat the Badge Check Gates!\c\nOnce you get through Victory Road,\nwhich is past the gates, you're finally\r\nat the Pokémon League!\c
Oh, that just made me think of when I was\nshowing you around the Pokémon Center\r\nin Accumula Town.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Do you regret setting out\non your Pokémon journey?
Professor Juniper: Oh! That's OK,\ndon't worry! You don't have to tell\r\nme everything.\c\nBut I'm very happy that you three\nchose to train Pokémon!\c\nBecause they create chances to meet\nmore wonderful people and Pokémon!\c
Professor Juniper: Thanks! That's the\ngreatest answer you could give!\c\nI was really happy to be able to give\nyou three those Pokémon as a present!\c\nBecause Pokémon create chances to meet\nmore wonderful people and Pokémon!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], this is a present for you!\c
Professor Juniper: This Master Ball is\nthe most powerful kind of Poké Ball.\c\nIt can catch any Pokémon without fail.\c\nThis is the only way I can support you,\nexcept to say...\r\nBe true to yourself.\c\nNo matter what happens, stay strong\nand keep going with your Pokémon!\c\nSee you!\c

Hi! I'm Iris, the amazingly strong\nGym Leader!\c\nTell me... What Pokémon are you using?\nHow will you fight?\c\nOoh, I'm super curious, so let's just\nget started!\c
Whoooa!\nThat was so cool!\c\nI'm sooo happy I could battle a Trainer\nas strong as you!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the Legend Badge\nfrom Iris.\c
Hey, that's your eighth Badge, right?\nThat's so cool!\c\nNow every Pokémon will do what you ask,\nno matter how big they are!\c\nKnow what? I'll give you this TM, too!\c
Dragon Tail doesn't just do damage.\c\nIt sends the other Pokémon back to its\nPoké Ball, too!\c
Ooh, hey!\nI wonder how Mister Alder is doing?\c\nI wonder if he's battling that Trainer\ncalled N in the Pokémon League right now?\c\nDo you know about the Pokémon League?\c\nIt's past Victory Road, at the end of\nRoute 10!
You've been on a journey and seen a lot\nof the world.\c\nI'm like that, too! I'm from way out in\nthe country.\c\nI'm really happy that I've gotten to\nmeet lots of different people\r\nand Pokémon!!
You've been on a journey and seen a lot\nof the world.\c\nI'm like that, too! I'm from way out in\nthe country.\c\nI'm really happy that I've gotten to\nmeet lots of different people\r\nand Pokémon!!
Welcome. Thank you for coming. I am\nOpelucid Pokémon Gym's Leader, Drayden.\c\nAs the mayor, I've given everything\nto developing the city.\c\nAs a Trainer, I've simply been pursuing\ngreater strength.\c\nBut what I'm searching for now is a young\nTrainer who can show me a bright future.\c\nPerhaps you can show me that future,\nthe way Iris has?\c
Wonderful.\c\nI'm grateful we had a chance to meet\nand battle.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the Legend Badge\nfrom Drayden!\c
Well, now. You've obtained all of the\nGym Badges in Unova.\c\nNow, all Pokémon will obediently follow\nyour commands.\c\nI also want you to have this.\nIt's a TM I'm particularly fond of.\c\nIt's called Dragon Tail.\c
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the\ndamaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball.\c\nIn other words, it switches your\nopponent's Pokémon.\c
Now, I have something to ask of you.\c\nHead for the Pokémon League and\ngo after Alder.\c\nThe Pokémon League is past Route 10,\nwhich runs from Opelucid City\r\nto Victory Road.\c\nI know Alder's strength, but I don't\nknow the depths of N's power...
Pokémon and people do not age because of\nthe passage of time.\c\nThey get old when the energy flowing in\ntheir hearts dries up.\c\nThis energy in our hearts is powered by\ntruth, ideals, or maybe dreams...\c\nThat probably changes with what you most\nhope for in your life.
Thanks for coming!\nI happily welcome you!\c\nBut...\nI may be a little rough on you!\c
Advancing or retreating is up to you.\nBut if you proceed, prepare yourself!\c\nMoving forward halfheartedly is\ndisrespectful to your Pokémon!
Welcome to the Opelucid Gym, the Unova\nregion's strongest and biggest trial!\c\nFirst off, please take this Fresh Water.\nIt'll help you in the challenge ahead.\c
Let me give you a brief explanation of\nthe trick to the Opelucid Gym!\c\nThe path around this Gym is shaped like\ntwo dragons.\c\nThis path changes when you step on\nthe switches on the dragons' arms.\c\nPay attention to how the dragons'\nnecks move!
You beat the Gym Leader?\nWow, that's amazing!\c\nOh, by the way, since I gave you all that\nFresh Water...\r\nDon't you owe me some of your winnings?\c\n...I'm kidding! It's just a joke!\nNo, seriously, congratulations!

The slow passage of time in\nOpelucid City...\r\nIt fits an old woman like me perfectly.
In Opelucid City, you can spend your\ndays in leisure and opulence...
Sometimes, I think this...\c\nThere could be another world, where\na person who looks just like me\r\nlives in a completely different way...
I imagine that even the exact same\nperson would change a lot by living in a\r\ndifferent world.

Iris: That single Dragon Pokémon,\nalong with twin heroes,\r\nbrought a new region into being.\c\nAnd people and Pokémon had happy lives!\c
Drayden: One day, however...\c\nThe twin heroes, the older brother\nwho sought the truth, and the\r\nyounger brother who sought ideals,\r\nbegan to argue about how to decide\r\nwhich one of them was right...\c\nThe single Dragon-type Pokémon\nthat had been with them all that time\r\nsplit its body into two.\c\nOne sided with the older brother,\nand the other with the younger brother.\c

Iris: In its pursuit of truth, the white\nDragon-type Pokémon sought to usher\r\nin a new and better world...\c\nIts name was Reshiram.\c\nAnd the other, the black Dragon-type\nPokémon, sought ideals and\r\nto usher in a new world--a world of hope.\c\nIts name was Zekrom.\c
Iris: In its pursuit of ideals, the black\nDragon-type Pokémon sought to usher\r\nin a new and better world...\c\nIts name was Zekrom.\c\nAnd the other, the white Dragon-type\nPokémon, sought truth, and to\r\nusher in a new world--a world of good...\c\nIts name was Reshiram.\c
Drayden: Because the two of them\nwere once the same entity,\r\ntheir battle raged endlessly\r\nand neither one could be\r\ndeclared the winner.\r\nThey simply exhausted themselves.\c\nThe twin heroes proclaimed that there\nwas no one side that was right\r\nand ceased the conflict.\c
Iris: But, but...\c\nThe two heroes' sons started the\nbattle again! And an instant later,\r\nReshiram and Zekrom destroyed\r\nUnova with fire and lightning!\c\nThen, they disappeared!\c\nBut, but...\nIf people work with Pokémon\r\nin the right way, we don't have to worry\r\nanymore about the world being destroyed.\c\nI mean, Reshiram and Zekrom\nworked hard for everyone\r\nand made a new region!\c\nSo, it should be all right, I think.\c

Drayden: True.\nPokémon cannot speak.\c\nPeople may hurt Pokémon even more by\nimposing their selfish thoughts on them.\c\nBut, no matter what, Pokémon and people\nbelieve in each other, need each other,\r\nand will continue to live together...\c
Iris: Yeah!\c\nSo I'm never gonna forgive Team Plasma\nfor trying to separate Pokémon and us!\c
Drayden: Sorry.\nWe got a little off topic at the end.\c\nThat is everything we know.\c\nUnfortunately, we don't know how\nto wake up the legendary Pokémon...\c
Drayden: I made a promise to Alder.\c\nYou must win the Gym Badge from\nthe Opelucid Pokémon Gym.\c
Iris, you go and be [VAR 0100(0000)]'s\nopponent at the Pokémon Gym.\c
Iris: Yay!\c\nLook out! I'm really, really strong,\njust like Drayden!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], I'll be waiting for\nyour challenge at the Pokémon Gym!\c
Drayden: What will it accomplish\nto separate the worlds of people\r\nand Pokémon?\c\nThe way we live now, with different beings\nunderstanding and forgiving each other,\r\nis much richer. That's my belief.
Iris: Everyone, people and Pokémon can\nget along and be happy. That's awesome!

I am coaching Iris.\c\nBut, honestly, she's been stronger than\nme ever since she came here!
The move Draco Meteor that Drayden\nteaches us is the strongest\r\nDragon-type move.\c\nHowever, it will sharply reduce\nSpecial Attack after use.
The move Draco Meteor that Iris teaches\nus is the strongest Dragon-type move.\c\nHowever, it will sharply reduce\nSpecial Attack after use.
Concerned about your Pokémon's weight?\c\nYou don't need to put it on a diet!\nJust let it hold this.\c
The weight of a Pokémon holding a\nFloat Stone will be halved!\c\nThat way, you can reduce the damage\ncaused by weight-based moves such as\r\nLow Kick and Grass Knot.
I have an item that I don't know how to\nuse. Would you give it a try and see if\r\nyou can make it work?
I know...\nYou'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!\c
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can\nbe hit even by a move that would usually\r\nhave no effect.\c\nFor example, a Normal-type move would\nhit a Ghost-type Pokémon.\c\nMastering this item is a bit tough...\nActually, it's very tough, but think\r\nhow useful it could be!

This way leads to Victory Road.\c\nBut if you don't have eight Badges,\nyou cannot reach the end.
Hi, Trainer!\nDo you have a minute?\c
I just heard this on the Xtransceiver.\nThere's a big storm on Route 7!\c\nAnd the storm seems to be different from\na natural phenomenon!\c\nSo strange!
I heard the storm on Route 7 was caused\nby a Pokémon!
The trembling before the Pokémon League\nis a tremor of excitement!
Victory Road stands in the way of a\nchallenge to the Pokémon League.\c\nYou need to have serious skills\nto get through it.

Whether or not you are troubled by the\nPokémon move Attract, take this!\c
When a Pokémon holding the Destiny Knot\nis affected by the move Attract, the\r\nopponent will also fall in love.\c\nIt's a bit difficult to use, but I hope it\nwill be useful!

It doesn't matter if we win or lose,\nas long as we have Pokémon with us!
You need to have eight Gym Badges\nto challenge the Pokémon League.\c\nHowever, even with such skills, it's hard\nto defeat the Elite Four who are waiting!
Glubaaa!

The Pokémon League is a place where you\nboth pursue strength and express it.\c\nThe way to express it is simple...\c\nYou just have to beat the Elite Four and\nthe Champion!\c\nYou can start your challenge by battling\nany of the Elite Four, and if you defeat\r\nthem all, you can challenge the Champion!\c\nHowever! I warn you, once you start\nyour challenge, there's no turning back.\c\nYou must keep battling until you defeat\nthem all...or are defeated yourself.\c\nDo you want to go in?
Once you start your challenge,\nyou cannot leave until you win against all\r\nor lose! Do you want to go in?
Then, proceed!\c
Don't neglect preparation!\c\nGo through the entrance there, and\nprepare as much as possible. Make sure\r\nyour Pokémon are fully recovered!\c

“Eyes brimming with dark flame, this man\n  rejected everything other than himself\r\n  in order to bring about one\r\n  singular justice..."\c\nThat's part of a novel I'm writing.

S-sorry!\nFirst, I must apologize to my Pokémon...\c\nI'm really sorry you had a bad\nexperience because of me!\c\nOh! It's not your fault!\nThis is how battles always are.\c\nEven in light of that, I'm still one of\nthe Elite Four!
Every person who works with Pokémon has\na Pokémon story to tell.\c\nI've found that stories where people and\nPokémon help each other out are far more\r\ninteresting than stories about only\r\npeople, or only Pokémon!
Challenger, if you defeat the entire\nElite Four of the Pokémon League,\r\nyou can go on to challenge the Champion.\c\nAnd you have earned that right.\c\nReturn to the plaza in the center\nand check the statue.
“The Trainer's thoughts joined with the\n  Pokémon's mind, and a lustrous\r\n  Aqua Ring unfurled..."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers who\r\ncome here and the Pokémon they train.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c

Man oh man...\nWhat is going on today?\c\nChallengers coming one\nright after another.\c\nWell, no matter.\c\nI am Grimsley of the Elite Four, and I will\nfulfill my duty to be your opponent.\c
Whether or not you get to fight at full\nstrength, whether or not luck smiles\r\non you--none of that matters.\c\nOnly results matter. And a loss is a loss.\c\nSee, victory shines like a bright light.\c\nAnd right now, you and your Pokémon\nare shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than\nthe guy who lost...\c\nNothing more, nothing less.\nSigh...\c\nYou should take that strength and test\nit against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing!\c\nYou have defeated every member of\nthe Pokémon League's Elite Four.\c\nBut it isn't over yet.\c\nThere is one more opponent against whom\nyou must prove your strength.\c\nThe pinnacle of the Pokémon League,\nthe Champion, Alder...\c\nOr, perhaps, that man called N has\ndefeated him and taken his title.\c\nI don't know which one you will face, but\ncheck the statue in the central plaza,\r\nand continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have\nto use the tools you're given.\c\nIt's more important to master the cards\nyou're holding than to complain about\r\nthe ones your opponents were dealt.\c\nLet us begin.\nAnd may the best Trainer win!\c\nContests like this are proof\nthat you are really living...\c
There are bad ways to win--\nand good ways to lose.\c\nWhat's interesting and troubling is that\nit's not always clear which is which.\c\nA flipped coin doesn't always land\nheads or tails.\c\nSometimes it may never land at all...
Excellent!\c\nThe nice thing about Pokémon battles is\nthey teach the loser something, as well.\c\nThat said...\nYou should take that strength and test\r\nit against the rest of the Elite Four!

Greetings, challenger.\nMy name is Marshal.\c\nIn order to master the art of fighting,\nI'm training under my mentor, Alder.\c\nMy mentor sees your potential as a\nTrainer and is taking an interest in you.\c\nIt is my intention to test you--to take\nyou to the limits of your strength. Kiai!\c
Whew! Well done!\c\nAs your battles continue,\naim for even greater heights!
Representing the Pokémon League in the\nabsence of the Champion has been my duty\r\nas Alder's student.\c\nHowever, there is nothing as empty as\nwords not backed up by strength.\c\nA word in your ear, strong challenger...\nThe other members of the Elite Four\r\nare far more powerful than I am.\c\nDo not underestimate them!
Now... You have become the strongest\nTrainer in this Pokémon League.\c\nThe statue in the central chamber will\ntake you to the Champion's room.\c\nWe, the Elite Four of Unova,\nare sworn to follow the Champion's order\r\nto be neutral.\c\nSo the rest is up to you!
I thank you deeply for the chance for\nanother round of combat against you.\c\nIn myself, I seek to develop\nthe strength of a fighter.\c\nAnd shatter any weakness in myself!\c\nPrevailing with the force of\nmy convictions!\c\nVictory, decisive victory, is my intention!\nChallenger, here I come!\c
There are still many strong Trainers\nin this Pokémon League.\c\nYou should deepen your bonds with\nyour Pokémon by battling with them.
In times past, I wandered all the regions\nof the world in pursuit of strength...\c\nOne day, I met my mentor and began to\ngrasp the wisdom of making strength\r\nan internal quality...\c\nAnd one day, I decided to become part of\nthe Elite Four of Unova...\c\nFor some reason, the battle we just had\nbrought those fateful times back to mind.
The strength shown by you and your\nPokémon has deeply impressed me...\c\nPlease, continue to the next room\nto face the strongest Trainer\r\nof the Unova region!

Who are you?\nHow impudent you are to disturb my sleep.\c\nHmf...\c\nYou appear to possess a combination of\nstrength and kindness. Very well.\c\nMake your best effort not to bore me\nwith a yawn-inducing battle. Clear?\c
You haven't faced all of the members\nof the Elite Four yet, have you?\c\nDon't concern yourself about me.\nGo on ahead.
In the past, when I battled, the force\nof my emotions shook me greatly.\c\nWhen my power awoke, I came close to\ndestroying everything around me.\c\nThat weak person no longer exists...\nStill, sometimes, my determination fails.\c\nAlways, I aspire to wrap up a victory\nwith elegance and grace.\c\nI invite you to be my opponent\nagain in the future, if you wish.
Somehow, you managed to defeat the\nentire Elite Four of the Pokémon League.\c\nCheck the statue in the center of the\nplaza for the way to the Champion's room.
Who's there?\nWho is so uncouth as to disturb my sleep?\c\nHmf... It's you again.\c\nStill, you possess that combination of\nkindness and strength. Yet you seem\r\nstronger than before...\c\nDo be sure not to bore me with a\nsnooze-inducing battle, is that clear?\c
Alas! Even with the knowledge and skill\npassed down in my family of Trainers,\r\nI still can't win.\c\nThe reason I came here in the first place\nwas to encounter Trainers like you...
In the past, my untrained heart made my\npower run wild.\r\nI was forbidden to battle.\c\nAll I craved then was to experience the\npure excitement of battling like this.\c\nHee hee...\nAlthough I'm embarrassed, I can't help\r\nsmiling right now.
You have defeated the\nPokémon League's Elite Four.\c\nYou have earned the right to\nproceed to the Champion's room.\c\nMaking an entrance is not the point.\c\nOnce you're there, you'll need to\nunleash your power to the fullest!

Hey, it's you, [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nAfter trading with this many people, you\nmust have friends all over the world!\c\nHa ha. If you go on a trip, no worries\nabout not knowing anyone, huh?\c\n'Kay, please pass through!\c

Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nI'll just do a brief security check.\c\n...W-what's this? Ooh, it's a kind of gum\nI've never seen! Is it a new brand?\r\nMaybe I'll buy some later.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nJust a little more, and you'll have\ntraded with every place here, huh?\c\nIt's really reassuring to me that kids\nlike you are going to be the ones running\r\nthe world!\r\nJust a little more to go. You can do it!\c\n'Kay, you can pass!\c

Hey, you over there!\nCome here for a second.\c
Don't just loiter around\nand cause trouble.
Don't get too wound up.\c\nIf you run around, fall, and get hurt,\nit'll cause me no end of trouble.
I suppose it's fine if you contact them\nonce in a while.\c\nI'm sure it'll make your folks happy.
That's all right. You're active--just like\na young person should be.\c\nDo your best!
Do you know people all over the world?\c\nI never would've imagined a world\nlike this when I was young.
When I was your age, the ladies\nused to get worked up over me. Ha ha!
Recently, it looks like there have been\nlots of global Trainers like you.
It feels like since you started coming,\nUnity Tower has gotten busier.\c\nKeep up the good work!
I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting\npretty full, then?\c\nWell, that's really something.
Unity Tower is as lively as ever\nwith people who come here to see you.\c\nWell, hope you enjoy yourself today.
How in the world did you manage to trade\nwith so many different places?
You must know a lot of people in\ndifferent places in the world.\c\nHa ha. Even if you go on a trip, no\nworries about not knowing anyone, huh?
I've been a guard for 30 years.\nToday, all is well, too.\r\nMmm... That's great!
I think I'll try buying that new gum\nnext time.
When I see you, I suddenly feel very\nsure that the future will be full of hope.
When you visit, Unity Tower gets exciting!\c\nThink of this place as your own backyard\nand feel free to go where you please.

I may walk fast, but I live a slow and\nrelaxing life.
I'm going home early today to have\nPokémon battles with my sisters.
Hello!\nGreeting is important, isn't it?
They say time is money. But when you\nspend time, you can't get it back.
There are always so many people here...
Even when I loaf, I do it all-out.\nI am always serious!
This city is a sleepless city...\nBut I need my beauty sleep.
I wish there were shoes\nthat recharge energy by walking!
My big customer must be waiting...
I just keep walking...today, tomorrow,\nand the day after tomorrow.
Good luck! Me!\nGood luck! You!
I will watch a baseball game\nthis weekend.
I am having a battle called a job!\nThis is quite tough. That's why it's fun!
Hmmm... It may be a good idea\nto Dress Up your Pokémon.
Have you had a Pokémon battle\nwith the Gym Leader, Burgh?\c\nHe's a strange one, but he likes Pokémon\nvery much.
I haven't traveled with my Pokémon\nfor a long time. I feel like doing that...
I will go to the Kanto region\nfor business.
People from different countries\ngather here in Castelia City.
Everyone is a professional walker!
Even in the crowd of people,\ndon't lose sight of yourself!
Every day, everybody goes their own way.
My business card has a picture of\nthe Pokémon I like best.
I always walk here, so\nI am good at dodging people.
Argh! You distracted me! I was trying\nto count all the pedestrians!
Hey, hey, kid!\nIt's dangerous!
Will you become a motorbike rider\nwhen you grow up?
The night wind is piercing right through\nme... My motorbike is freezing, too...
Zowieee!
Wooooo!
Is that so?
Yes.
Huh?
Oh, no!
What's up?
Sorry.
Bye-bye!
Nah.
Eep!
I see!
How is it?
Hello!

Ouch...
Hi!

Hey! Hey, you!\nWhat was the first Pokémon you received?\c\n...\n...\c\n[VAR 0101(0000)]! Really?\nThen [VAR 0101(0001)] could be a big help!\c
Your [VAR 0101(0000)] does not do well against\n[VAR 0103(0002)]-type Pokémon!\c\nSay, do you want this [VAR 0101(0001)] of mine?
Oh? You can only have six Pokémon\nat a time with you, that's all.\c\nIf you want this Pokémon, you'll have\nto store one of your others in the PC\r\nat the Pokémon Center.
My, my. If you want it, come back and\ntalk to me again, OK?
OK. Here you go!\c\nIt can use Fire-type moves, so that\nmakes it hot against Grass types!\c
OK. Here you go!\c\nIt can use Water-type moves, so that\nmakes it cool against Fire types!\c
OK. Here you go!\c\nIt can use Grass-type moves, so that\nmakes it great against Water types!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received [VAR 0101(0001)]!
Give a nickname to the [VAR 0101(0001)]\nyou received?
If you have many types of Pokémon,\nsomething will work out, no matter\r\nwhat kind of Pokémon you have to face.
Bianca: Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you looking\nfor the mysterious Pokémon, too?\c
Bianca: I'm just really, really wondering\nhow showing dreams works...
Bianca: Hey!\c\nDid you hear a sound coming\nfrom the other side of that wall?\c\nCome on! Let's go see!
Muuuun...
Bianca: Oh! Wait!\c
???: We found you, Munna!\c
???: Come on! Come on!\nMake some Dream Mist!\c
Munna: ...Mu!
Bianca: Huh?\c\nWho are you?!\c\nWhat are you doing?\c
???: Are you talking about us?\nWe're Team Plasma.\c\nWe battle day and night to liberate\nPokémon from foolish humans!\c
Team Plasma: What are we doing?\c\nThe Pokémon Munna and Musharna\nemit a mysterious vapor called\r\nDream Mist, which shows people's dreams.\c\nWe're going to use that to make people\nwant to release their Pokémon...\c\nWe'll show them dreams\nto manipulate their hearts.\c
Munna: Mu... Naa...
Team Plasma: Come on!\nSpit out that Dream Mist!\c
Bianca: You're kicking a Pokémon\nto make it give off Dream Mist?\c\nThat's mean! Why?\nYou're Trainers too, right?\c
Team Plasma: That's right.\c\nWe're Pokémon Trainers too, but\nwe're fighting for a different reason.\c\nUnlike you two, we're fighting for\nthe freedom of Pokémon!\c
Team Plasma: And setting Pokémon free\nmeans that we win Pokémon battles and\r\ntake Pokémon by force!\c\nSo, on that note, we are going to rescue\nyour Pokémon from you!\c
Bianca: Whaaat!\nDon't hurt [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Team Plasma: Were you not taking them\nseriously because they're kids?\c\nWell, whatever, I'm next!\c
Team Plasma: ...I can't\nbelieve we lost!\c\nBut we have to \nobtain the Dream Mist!\c
Come on!\nMake with the Dream Mist!\c
Bianca: Knock it off!\c
Ghetsis: What are you two doing\ngoofing off?\c
Ghetsis: We, Team Plasma,\nshall separate Pokémon\r\nfrom foolish people!\c
Ghetsis: If you cannot\nfulfill your duties...\c
Team Plasma: T-this isn't...\c\nGhetsis when he is gathering followers...\nOr Ghetsis when he is trying\r\nto control people by tricking them\r\nwith speeches!\c
Team Plasma: Yeah...\c\nThis is Ghetsis when a plan has failed,\nand he is about to issue punishment...\c
Team Plasma: At any rate, let's hurry\nand say we're sorry so he forgives us!\c
???: Shaaar!
Bianca: ...What was that just now?\c\nThat person called Ghetsis\nappeared all over the place, and\r\nit wasn't real, right?!\c\n...Could it have been a dream?\c
And that Pokémon...\c
Oh!\c
Fennel: I couldn't wait, so I came over!\c\n...Is that Musharna?!\c
Musharna: Musha?
Munna: Munii!
Fennel: Did something happen?\c
Bianca: Oh, Fennel.\c\nWell, you see, Munna was here...\nBut Team Plasma and Munna...\c\nAnd Musharna came...\nAnd it showed us something like a dream?\r\nAnd then, Team Plasma...\c
Fennel: I think I followed that...\c\nSee, Musharna evolves from Munna.\nSo, seeing Munna in trouble, it\r\nused its power--making dreams\r\ninto reality--to save Munna.\c\nWhich means...wait a second!\c
Is this Dream Mist?!\c
With this, I can complete my research!\nYou two come to my house later, OK?\c
Bianca: Phew. How random was that?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], why don't you go\nto Fennel's house?\c\nMe? Well, I'm going to go look\nfor the Pokémon we saw just now.\c
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], why don't you go\nto Fennel's house?\c\nMe? Well, I'm going to go look\nfor the Pokémon we saw just now.
Gorm: Boo!\c
Were you surprised?\c\nOh, Trainer-who-destroyed-our-castle,\nI was quite surprised by you!\c
If you surprise them, both Pokémon\nand people leave themselves open.\c\nWhile they're in a state of surprise,\nthey can't use their powers\r\nlike they normally would.\c\nOur intention was to surprise people\nby making our castle appear and\r\nshowing off the legendary Pokémon...\c\nAt that moment, we planned to deeply\nimpress people's hearts with the\r\nawesome power of Team Plasma\r\nand the brilliance of our new world.\c
Now that I've seen the strength of\nspirit in you and the Gym Leaders,\r\nI wonder how effective that strategy\r\nwould have been, after all.\c\nMaybe that strength of spirit\nis what's needed to take Pokémon\r\nto the next level?\c\nHm... I'm sorry to have wasted your time\nwith this silly conversation.\r\nTake this with you.\c
Gorm: My lord N's dream...\nYou were the one who put a stop to that.\r\nPlease don't ever forget that.\c
Looker: Ah... And now,\nabout Team Plasma...\c\nI am an officer of the\nInternational Police, and there are so\r\nmany things you must tell me at once!\c
Gorm: Musharna is said to appear here.\c\nIts Dream Mist makes you see dreams,\nbut they are nothing but illusions.\c\nThe dreams you realize with your\nown abilities are the real dreams.\c
Looker: Accept my thanks!\c\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding,\nthere yet remains but [VAR 0200(0000)] of the\r\nSeven Sages still at large.\c\nWhat it is they are thinking,\nwhat it may be they are hoping,\r\nthis is the information I pursue.\r\nUntil we meet again!\c
Looker: A thousand thanks!\c\nEh, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nOn a topic I must speak to you.\c\nHaving received such a report, of\nsomeone far from here, who has seen\r\na person like N and...a dragon Pokémon.\c\nI am on my way to ascertain the\ncertainty of this information.\r\nWe will meet again one day!\c

If you go straight, it doesn't take long.\nBut if you go the wrong way, it's a maze.\c\nIs Pinwheel Forest a\npath or a maze for you?
Burgh: This leads to Pinwheel Forest.\c\nIf they manage to scuttle off into the\nforest, we might have trouble.\c
Yo! Traveling Trainer!\nAre your Pokémon getting stronger?\r\nHere! This might come in handy!\c
Rock Smash is a move that sometimes\nreduces your foe's Defense stat.\c\nIt is super effective against Normal-type\nPokémon, which Gym Leader Lenora likes!
It's a challenge rock.\c\nWould you like to have [VAR 0102(0000)]\nsmash the rock?
[VAR 0102(0000)] tried to smash the\nchallenge rock.\c\nA piece of the rock broke away!\c

In order to eliminate the old-fashioned\nways of looking at things...
We will steal Pokémon!\nYou'll never play together again!
If their Pokémon are liberated,\nTrainers will no longer be Trainers!
We are in the right!
Everyone else is wrong!
If you don't think the same way we think,\nwe'll use all our power to eliminate you!
Burgh: Well, you see...\c\nThere are two ways out of\nPinwheel Forest--\c\nthe road that goes straight and the\npath that winds through the woods.\c
I will take the straight road after them!\c
If they're not there,\nI'll block the exit.\c
Would you please take the other way\nand check whether Team Plasma\r\nis hiding in there somewhere?\c\nYou'll run into a lot of Trainers,\nbut it's basically a single path,\r\nso I'm sure you won't get lost.\c
Come on!\nLet's do this for Lenora's sake!\c
Burgh: Mm-hmm?\c\nTeam Plasma hasn't come\nin this direction...\c\nThe forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Burgh: Mm-hmm?\c\nTeam Plasma hasn't come\nin this direction...\c\nThe forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.\c
Team Plasma: You stubborn brat!\c\nWhen I'm through with you,\nyou won't be able to chase us anymore!\c
Team Plasma: Too bad!\nI haven't got anything!\c\nIf you want to get it back,\nyou're just gonna have\r\nto look for my associates!
Team Plasma: My, my.\nCould you be looking for something?\c
Team Plasma: Sorry!\nI'm empty handed.\c\nDo I look like the kind of girl\nto carry a heavy load?\c\nBetter try somewhere else!
Team Plasma: So you made it this far!\c\nI'll hold you here so my friends\ncan get away!\c
Team Plasma: Yep! I'm here to buy time!\c\nAnd if you don't step lively,\nwe're going to get away!
Team Plasma: A pursuer?\c\nUh, ha ha. A kid like you--\nbeat some of us?!\c\nThat can't be helped, but...\nI'll take you on now!\c
Team Plasma: Fine.\nTake your stupid skull!\c
Team Plasma: So the dream our king had--\nthe dream we had--won't come true...\c
Gorm: How are you holding up,\nfellow subject of our king?\c
Team Plasma: Gorm of the Seven Sages!\c\nI'm mortified that this skull, which we\nwent to so much trouble to obtain,\r\nwas stolen from us so easily.\c
Gorm: It's not important.\c\nWe can afford to abandon\nthe Dragon Skull.\c\nAccording to the results of our\nresearch, this is not the legendary\r\nPokémon for which Team Plasma is looking.\r\nIt is completely unrelated.\c
But we will not allow anyone to disrupt\nour plans and get away with it.\c\nWe will fix it so you never interfere\nwith us again.\c
Burgh: Oh, sweet!\c\nThe bug Pokémon were getting\nall worked up, so here I come,\r\nand what do I spy with my little eye?\c\nThis important-looking guy!\c\nAre you here to help your friends,\nwhom I defeated?\c
Lenora: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nBurgh!\c\nThe others didn't have anything...\c\nAnd who are you supposed to be?\c\nIs this guy the big boss?\c
Gorm: I am one of the Seven Sages\nof Team Plasma.\c\nGhetsis, another of the Seven Sages,\nwill liberate Pokémon with words alone!\c\nThe remainder of the Seven Sages have\nordered their compatriots to take\r\nPokémon with full force!\c\nBut the odds are a little against us now.\c\nTo you, the Bug Pokémon user Burgh and\nthe Normal Pokémon user Lenora, I say...\c\nKnow your enemies, know yourself,\nand you need not fear the result\r\nof a hundred battles...\r\nThis time, we shall retreat quietly.\c
To secure the liberation of Pokémon,\nwe will steal Pokémon from Trainers!\c\nEven though you are Gym Leaders,\nwe will not tolerate any further\r\nobstruction from you.\c\nIn any case, we will settle this someday.\c\nI hope you are looking forward\nto that time as much as I...\c
Lenora: They're a speedy bunch.\c\nWhat are you planning to do, Burgh?\nAre you going to chase them?\c
Burgh: Hmmm...\c\nWe got back the stolen skull,\nand if we corner them, there's\r\nno telling what they might do.\c\nI think I'll be heading back, Lenora...\c
Well, now. Well...\nI'll be waiting for your challenge at\r\nCastelia City's Pokémon Gym.\c\nYes, indeed.\nI'm certainly looking forward to it!\c
Lenora: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou're holding the Dragon Skull you\nworked so hard to get back, right?\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] gave the\n[VAR 0109(0001)] to Lenora!\c
Lenora: [VAR 0100(0000)], thank you so much.\c\nWith a kind Trainer like you\ntaking care of them, the Pokémon\r\nwith you must be happy.\c\nHere is a token of my gratitude.\nPlease use it carefully!\c
Lenora: This is a Moon Stone!\c\nSome Pokémon evolve when you\nuse this item on them.\c\nNow, I must take the Dragon Skull\nback to the museum!\c\nSee you! Take care of yourself!\c
I run every day!\nMy goal is to be the marathon champion\r\nof the Unova region!
The trees cut on this forest road are\nsent from Driftveil City to the world.
Have you heard of phytoncides?\c\nI don't really understand, but I heard\nthat the reason forests make you\r\nfeel good is phytoncides!
Hmm... I can feel it...\nThe presence of fierce Pokémon.
The surface is covered with moss.\nTouching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!\c\n\nA forest is likely to contain many\nwell-hidden items!\c\nThey may be hard to find,\nso look carefully!

Professor Juniper: Hi there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
I heard about these Pokémon statues,\nand I came to look into their origins!\c
I've learned that each of these Pokémon\nstatues is actually a real Pokémon!\c\nIt's called Darmanitan. It's sleeping,\nso it's become like a stone.\c
When I quickly measured how long\nthey've existed...\c\nIt was amazing! Around 2,500 years!\nSeems like they went to sleep that\r\nlong ago.\c\nThat means they've been here since\nbefore this place was in ruins, when\r\nthe Relic Castle was flourishing.\c\nPerhaps they were guarding the city.\c
These Pokémon...\c\nThey are either in a state of hibernation\nor meditation, so if you wake them, they\r\nwill become active once again.\c\nAnd the item that wakes up Darmanitan is\nactually...this RageCandyBar!\c\nThat's why I will share one with you,\ntoo, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Well, I'm headed back to the\nPokémon Research Lab.\r\nBe seeing you!\c
It appears to be a statue of a Pokémon.
Give the RageCandyBar to the\nPokémon statue?
The ancient Pokémon statue responded to\nthe RageCandyBar.\c\nThe Pokémon was a sleeping Darmanitan!\c\nThe awakened Darmanitan attacked!\c
Cheren: Stop, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Cheren: That's the entrance to the\nRelic Castle.\c\nYou're impressive, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nmaking it here before I did.\c
Dealing with the Desert Resort's Pokémon\ntook longer than I would've thought.\c\nI only made it all the way out here\nthanks to my Pokémon.\c
Alder went on ahead. Let's hurry.
Cheren: It's hard to put into words...\nbut I'll never forgive them for this!\c
Alder: What could that guy called\nN possibly want?\c\nCould he be trying to prove he is\nright by winning the battle of the\r\ntwo dragons?\c

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
[VAR 0100(0000)] picked up the Xtransceiver.\c
Alder: I could hear Professor Juniper's\nvoice from clear over here!\r\nSeems like something big is happening.\c\nI wonder what is waiting at the museum\nin Nacrene City.\r\nI'll go on ahead!\c
Cheren: I'll look around here once more.\c\nI don't want to believe what\nthat Ghetsis says...\c\nYou should head for the\nNacrene City Museum.
I came clear out to the Desert Resort\nto train, but...\c\nThere are so many Ground-type Pokémon,\nand I'm already in tatters...
You're the first person to come\nclear out here to talk to me!\c\nI'm so moved!\nSo, I'll give you this!\c
If a Pokémon holds this Soft Sand, the\npower of its Ground-type moves goes up!
According to what I've heard, that\nRelic Castle is the ruins of a city built\r\nby the hero of old and the dragon\r\nPokémon that accompanied the hero.

Oh! A sea of sand! I don't need\nGo-Goggles here!\c\nOh, I've come here all the way from\nthe Hoenn region.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 167

The Desert Resort is especially known for\nthe Relic Castle.
I'm a School Kid, so I know this!\c\nJust like in caves, you can run into\nPokémon almost anywhere in the desert.\c\nBut they don't like hiding in the pale\nsand. So if you walk there, you won't\r\nhave to worry about battling.

I've been carrying two Pokémon Fossils,\nbut they're just so heavy...\c\nWould you take one of them off my hands?
Oh, you like the Cover Fossil?\c\nI heard it is the Fossil of a Pokémon\nthat used to swim in the ancient sea!\c
Oh, you like the Plume Fossil?\c\nIt is the Fossil of a bird Pokémon\nthat lived in an ancient forest.\r\n...But they say it couldn't fly.\c
Oh, won't you please take one?\nThey're really weighing me down.
Oh, did you change your mind? Great!\nYou can have your choice of Fossils!
The museum in Nacrene City...\c\nI hear Pokémon can be restored from\nFossils there.\c\n'Cause Lenora loves bones and Fossils!

Trainer! You still can't move ahead\n'cause there is so much sand!\c\nI will do my best to remove the sand.\nGive me a second!

There! The sand is cleared away, so now\nyou can proceed.

Cheren: Whew! I finally caught up.\c
Alder: You two. Come here...\nCome to my side.\c
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.\c\nIt seems you are working hard\nto resurrect Zekrom, the other\r\nDragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?\c\nBut it appears the Dark Stone you seek\nis not here.\c
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.\c\nIt seems you are working hard\nto resurrect Reshiram, the other\r\nDragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?\c\nBut it appears the Light Stone you seek\nis not here.\c
Well then, congratulations are in order!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], you were chosen by our king.\c\nIf you truly desire to keep the world as\nit is, where Pokémon live alongside\r\npeople, you must bring the other\r\nDragon-type Pokémon spoken of\r\nin legend and battle with our king.\c\nOtherwise, Team Plasma will steal every\nPokémon from every person in the world\r\nand release them all!\c
Alder: Release them, you say?\c\nDo the Pokémon who live with their\nTrainers actually want that?\c\nIs the liberation you talk about really\njust stealing Pokémon from people?\c
Ghetsis: What's this?\c\nChampion Alder, even though illness took\nthe Pokémon that had been your partner\r\nfor many years, and you haven't had a\r\nserious battle in all that time...\c\nEven you, who ordered the Elite Four to\nprotect the Pokémon League and left to\r\nwander the Unova region alone...\c\nEven a Champion like you now wants to\nprotect a world where Pokémon and\r\npeople live together?\c
Team Plasma's king will show the people of\nUnova that he is stronger than a\r\nChampion who keeps Pokémon bound!\c\nAnd just like the hero who founded\nUnova, he will be accompanied by the\r\nlegendary Pokémon.\c\nHe will give this order!\n“Trainers, release your Pokémon!"\c\nFor this, we have prepared a suitable\ncastle for the legendary Reshiram and\r\nour king!\c

Alder: I won't lose!\c\nI'll fight for all Trainers who love their\nPokémon, and for all Pokémon who believe\r\nin their Trainers!\c
Ghetsis: Our king has no interest in you.\c\nHe has already determined that victory\nagainst you is assured.\c
Alder: So you stayed behind just to\ntell me that? Just to make a fool of me?\c
Ghetsis: Of course not.\c\nI'm doing this out of kindness.\nYes, kindness.\c\nI'm making sure the Champion doesn't\nget hurt for no reason.\c\nGranted, the moment when\nsomeone loses all hope...\c\nI really do love to watch\nthat moment.\c\nWell then, farewell.\c
Cheren: Alder...\nWhat are you going to do now?\c
Alder: Hmmm...\c\nIt seems my only choice is to return to\nthe Pokémon League and battle N.\c\nBut it bothers me to do exactly what\nGhetsis wants...\c\nMore importantly, what should we do\nabout the Dark Stone?\c
Alder: Hmmm...\c\nIt seems my only choice is to return to\nthe Pokémon League and battle N.\c\nBut it bothers me to do exactly what\nGhetsis wants...\c\nMore importantly, what should we do\nabout the Light Stone?\c

Ryoku: I was planning to catch the\nPokémon called Volcarona that lives\r\nin this Relic Castle and present it\r\nto Ghetsis.\c\nBut the Shadow Triad said that Ghetsis\nhas gone somewhere, right?\c
The Seven Sages...\c\nWe always said we were complete when the\nseven of us were together.\c\nNow I don't know the meaning of those\nwords anymore.\c\nI guess I don't mind, even if we were\nbeing used, but the dream is over.\c
I no longer need this.\c\nGhetsis gave it to me, but I have no use\nfor it.\c
Ryoku: This Relic Castle and our own\ncastle are both crumbling...\c\nBut what's different is that this Relic\nCastle is the remains of a civilization.\c\nAnd our castle left nothing behind...\c
Looker: Regarding Team Plasma...\c\nI am an officer of the International\nPolice, and you must satisfy my request\r\nfor certain information!\c
Ryoku: Understood.\c\nBut we don't know much about Ghetsis or\nour lord N!\c\nWe haven't even figured out if they are\nfather and son...\c
Looker: Accept my thanks!\c\nNow, Ghetsis notwithstanding,\nthere yet remains but [VAR 0200(0000)] of the\r\nSeven Sages still at large.\c\nThey are thinking--upon what topics?\nThey are hoping--upon what chances?\c\nThis is of the utmost urgency.\nAt once! On the way!\c

You want to know about this place?\nThis is the Cold Storage.\c\nInside, there are Workers\nwith their Pokémon!
The reason why Clay is having you look\nfor Team Plasma is 'cause he is testing\r\nyour abilities.
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nDo you think Team Plasma could be\nin there?\c\nI don't like cold places, but we have\nto check. What a bother.
Cheren: All right, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLet's get this over with.
You can get to the Cold Storage through\nthe gap between the fence and the\r\ncontainer over there.
For a few loads, send it by Pokémon.\nFor a lot of loads, send it by ship.\c\nUse the best method for your needs!
A helmet is an important tool for\nshock protection!\c\nIt's good to let your Pokémon\nhave one, too!\c

Cheren: Oh... Is someone in there?
Shall we go, then?
But the only place in the Cold Storage\nwe haven't searched is here, right?

Right now, I'm shivering.\nI'm suffering, but I'm alive.\c
Pokémon and people live by being\ntogether and relying on one another.\r\nThat might be how you feel.\c\nIf that's so, is it necessary to\nseparate people and Pokémon?\c\nBy talking to you, I've discovered that\nthere's much I need to think about...\c\nI wish I had more to give you in thanks...\nHere, take this.\c
Zinzolin: My lord N said that he wanted\nto make Pokémon perfect...\c\nBut, even if the relationship between\nPokémon and people stayed as it now is,\r\nPokémon can aspire to perfection...\c
Looker: Indeed! I am an officer of the\nInternational Police, and I demand to\r\nhear all you know about Team Plasma!\c

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]Ah, yes.\c\nThat was the Shadow Triad, just now.\nGhetsis enlisted them in Team Plasma.\c\nApparently, they were the ones who\nprepared the Galvantula nest\r\nat the cave entrance.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]Chargestone Cave...\nI like this place.\c\nFormulas express electricity and\nits connection to Pokémon...\c\nIf people did not exist,\nthis would be an ideal place.\c\nYou have been chosen, you know.\nDoes it surprise you I said that?[VAR BE09(0000)]

This place is always charged with\nlots of electricity that Pokémon like!\c\nThe electric charges react from one\nstone to another, and that's why\r\nsome of the stones are floating!\c\nBut not all of the stones can be pushed.\c
My father asked me to research Klink,\nwhich is a Pokémon that looks like a gear,\r\nbecause I'm researching the origins\r\nof Pokémon and the era they appeared.\c\nHe knows how to get what he wants from\npeople, but I was already interested in\r\nthis anyway, so it's a lot of fun!\c\nOh, yeah!

Professor Juniper: Giving that Lucky Egg\nto a Pokémon to hold increases the\r\namount of Exp. Points received in\r\nbattle by a lot!\c\nHaving strong Pokémon will make\nit easier to fill your Pokédex pages!
Professor Juniper: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAre you working on your Pokédex?\c\nKeep encountering lots of Pokémon,\nso you can keep filling in those pages!
Bianca: I'm the professor's bodyguard!\c\nWell, that's probably not necessary, but\nyou have to protect important things!
Professor Juniper: Hi there!\nDid you find something?\c\nI think we're just about\ndone collecting data.\c
This cave has been around since the\ndistant past, but...\c\nData to prove that Klink existed more\nthan a hundred years ago can't be found.\c\nSo that must mean...\c\nKlink suddenly appeared a hundred\nyears ago!\c
Where Pokémon came from\nand where they are going...\c\nIf we can learn that, I believe\nwe can get along even better!\c
Bianca: Know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nPokémon are mysterious!\c\nI wonder why these amazing\nlittle guys stay by our sides.
Where Pokémon came from\nand where they are going...\c\nIf we can learn that, I believe\nwe can get along even better!

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]Professor Juniper,\nwhat are you thinking?\c\nYou appear to have no qualms about the\nrelationship between Pokémon and people.\c\nYou put Pokémon into categories using\narbitrary rules and think you can\r\nunderstand them like that...\r\nThe very idea of a Pokédex revolts me.\c\nWhat do you have to say for yourself?[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Professor Juniper: Oh, my.\nLooks like you're not my biggest fan.\c\nYour opinion is understandable.\nIt happens to be different from mine,\r\nwhich is equally understandable.\c\nHow about if all people get to decide for\nthemselves how to relate to Pokémon?\c
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]You're saying I should just allow\npeople to think whatever they want and\r\ntreat Pokémon however they want,\r\nno matter whether the Pokémon suffer?\c\nI refuse to tolerate the existence\nof a world like that![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Professor Juniper: Well, I didn't expect\nhim to change his mind right away.\c\nBut I hope he'll spend a little time\ntrying to understand how others feel.\c
Now, then...\nI think I'll go collect a little more data.\c\nFor Pokémon and people to get\nalong better, we need to take steps\r\nto learn more about them!\c

Alder: Oh, honestly, Cheren.\c\nJust accept the compliment without the\nstinging remark.\c\nI've asked you this before, but what do\nyou plan to do after becoming strong?\c
Cheren: If I get strong and become a\nChampion, that will be the reason for\r\nmy existence.\r\nI want to prove that I'm really living.\c

Marshal: My mentor told me you were\nhere, so I came to see.\c\nListen. Even if you lose in battle, if you\nsurpass what you've done before, you\r\nhave bested yourself.\c\nTake the opportunity of a battle to\nlook at your opponent,\r\nlook at the Pokémon involved,\r\nand look at yourself!\c
Cheren: Are those Alder's words?\c
Marshal: Maybe. But I'm borrowing them.\c\nWhat I want are battles with Trainers\nwho believe in themselves like that...\c\nWhen I mix it up with a Trainer like\nthat, both my Pokémon and I\r\nget even stronger.\c\nWell then, I'll be waiting for your\nchallenge in the Pokémon League.\c
Cheren: I guess that's that.\c\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAccept this Pokémon battle!\c
Cheren: I'll keep battling many Trainers\nand Pokémon like this, and if I can learn\r\nwhat kind of person I am, it will open up\r\nmy path.\c\nI'm sure this path will lead me to become\nthe person I'm meant to be.\c\nPokémon will always be with you and me as\nwe go down our own paths.\c\nOur important friends, Pokémon...
Cheren: Oh, you showed up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIn order to surpass myself up to this\npoint, and to beat a purely strong\r\nPokémon Trainer such as yourself, I'm\r\nchallenging you to a Pokémon battle!\c

Do you want to go back to Castelia City?
We are just about to leave, so please\nget on board and wait a moment.\c
Just come talk to me when you want\nto return to Castelia City!
That Team Plasma...\c\nThey sure do terrible things!
The smell of the ocean is so soothing!
Waaah! I'm scared!
You sure took care of\nthose bad guys, mister!
You sure took care of\nthose bad guys, miss!
Making my grandchild cry!\c\nIf they are underestimating me because\nI'm old... Grrr!
Thank you very much for\nsaving my grandchild.
Shut your trap!\c\nIf you stay here quietly,\nwe won't be rough.
What do they hope to accomplish\nby occupying the island?\r\nWhat a sketchy group!
If I had known this island's secret\nearlier, I would've...\c\nWhat? No! Nothing!\nJust talking to myself!
What are they doing in this little\nmemorial park? There's nothing here\r\nbut an old lighthouse...
Too many people use Pokémon\nfor bad deeds!
This officer's Pokémon couldn't stand up\nto them!\r\nThat blasted Team Plasma!
I'm really glad a strong Trainer\nlike you is around!
Recently, I've been bored because\nthe number of tourists has decreased.
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich\nfamily bought this island and named it\r\nLiberty Garden.\c\nIt's a place where people and Pokémon\ncould live freely.
Dock 2\nTo board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light\nof freedom.\c\nOnly authorized personnel may enter.
My fellow officers rushed here by\npolice boat!\c\nThanks to them, we rounded up\nthese baddies!
How's that Pokémon doing?\c\nThe island sure has been quiet since\nthat incident.
Team Plasma forever!
We won't give up!
You're irredeemable!
Get moving!
Professor Juniper: Thanks to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], this group that was\r\nup to no good has been captured!\c
Victini is a mythical Pokémon that is said\nto radiate energy from its body...\c\nWhen Pokémon or people come into contact\nwith that energy, it fills up their bodies,\r\nand they exhibit more power than usual.\c\nThat's why there was no end to the\npeople who wanted to use Victini for\r\ntheir own evil ends...\c\nI'm sure the rich person who built this\nunderground room for Victini was\r\nsincerely trying to help it.\c\nBut I think shutting the poor thing up in\nthis room was a mistake.\c\nThanks to you, Victini has a new destiny\nthat does not involve being used in\r\nTeam Plasma's schemes.\c\nMaking sure no one misuses Victini's\npowers is now your duty!\c
Also...\c\nIn the Unova Pokédex, Victini was\nassigned a special number: zero.\c\nI've heard the special number was\nassigned in the hope that Victini's power\r\nto bring victory would be shared with the\r\nTrainer who travels with this Pokédex...\c
Professor Juniper!\c\nWe cornered the crooks with our\nhigh-speed police boat!\c\nWe will return to Castelia City!\nPlease come on board, too!\c
Professor Juniper: Thank you!\nI'll be right there!\c
I can't believe it when people are led\nastray by Pokémon's astounding abilities\r\nand try to misuse them...\c\nBut it's only when we face Pokémon with a\ngood heart that we can make a\r\nbrighter future!\c

The one who obtains this Pokémon is said\nto be victorious in any type\r\nof competition...\c\nWe can obtain a power that would make\nus invincible!\c\nThat is the value of this mythical\nPokémon, Victini!\c
This is a secret room meant\nto hide Victini!\c\nTwo hundred years ago, a certain rich\nperson bought this entire island and hid\r\nVictini in this underground room.\c\nAfter that, no one saw Victini, and it\nbecame a mythical Pokémon...\c
We, Team Plasma, will liberate Victini\nfrom this room and use its powers to make\r\nour goal a reality!\c\nWe won't let a brat like you get in\nour way!\c
It looks like I underestimated\nyour strength.\c\nBut Victini won't be so simple!\nLook!\c
Looks like it's waiting to test your\nstrength. You'd better get ready!
Living with Victini means accepting\nVictini's cruel destiny...\c\nSomeday we will test you to see if you are\ntruly ready for that.\c
Victini is still close by and watching\nyour movements...\c\nIf you exit this room and come back, it\nmight return...
Ta-ta-ta-tah!
Victini vanished from the\nunderground room...\c

Oh, it's just a kid...\c
You... It couldn't be...\c\nThe fact that you are here means you\ncame to learn about the secret\r\nof Genesect!\c
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from\na Fossil.\c\nThen we enhanced the Pokémon with the\npower of science!\c
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!\c
But, our lord N was not interested in\nthis Genesect that was modified by the\r\npower of science!\c
“Science damages the natural beauty\nof Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"\c
That's what he said...\c\nSo our research was halted, and this\nfacility was closed...\c
However!!\nThe Genesect research is all mine!\c\nSo if you want to know Genesect's\nsecret, you'll have to beat me in battle!\c
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything...\c\nI forgot my duty as a Scientist is\nto make the world happy.\c\nSo, this must be what I get for trying to\nmake a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...\c
I'm going to wash my hands of this\nGenesect matter...\c\nI don't need this anymore...\nI'll give it to you.\c
There was another one in my\nother pocket...\c
The item I just gave you was made\nfor Genesect.\c\nWhen it holds an item like this, it\nchanges the type of the move called\r\nTechno Blast, so it can always have\r\nan advantage.\c
There sure are some very cowardly\nTrainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives.\nUse them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the\nside of the monitor.\c\nRead it?
My lord N apparently rejected\nmy research...\c\nBut my research is necessary for\nTeam Plasma to reach its goal...\r\nThe strongest Pokémon...\c\nThe rest of the memo is torn and\nimpossible to read.

Hello! If you cross the Skyarrow Bridge\nfrom here, you'll reach Castelia City.

If you give it to a Pokémon to hold,\nmaybe it will let that Pokémon use its\r\nmove before its opponent can.\c\nThat's what I gave you.\nIt's called Quick Claw!
There are people who are obsessed with\ncertain items.\c\nThey'll even buy your items for a lot\nof money!\c\nYou might even be able to sell items you\ncan't use to these people, so maybe you\r\nshould hang on to them.

Sometimes, above the bridge, you can\nsee the shadows of bird Pokémon, right?\c\nTheir feathers drift to the ground here!\c\nAnd when you try to pick them up,\noccasionally, you'll run into a Pokémon.
When a ship passes, the bridge raises\nand lowers.\c\nBut Clay controls when the ships run\nfrom the start, so when the bridge\r\nraises and lowers is up to Clay.
When Driftveil is mentioned, what comes\nto mind is the Cold Storage...\r\nand Charles!

Ghetsis: Excellent. It seems that\nyou have obtained the Light Stone.\c\nI congratulate you on a job well done.\c
It is my lord N's thought that the two\nholders of the legendary Pokémon\r\nshould put their beliefs on the line\r\nand strive to find which is the true hero.\c
This is not necessary, however.\c\nFrom his infancy, I provided him with the\neducation required to become the hero\r\nof legend. Indeed, he has been so\r\nacknowledged by the legendary Pokémon.\c\n...Such purity of purpose is his.\c
The liberation of Pokémon of which I... Of\nwhich Team Plasma speaks is the\r\nseparation of Pokémon from\r\nfoolish people!\c\nThat's the truth! All Trainers will become\nhelpless to resist us!\c\nWe alone will be able to use Pokémon!\c
The preparations are complete!\c\nWhen my perfect plan is set in motion,\nfirst a few gullible Pokémon Trainers who\r\nare unable to resist Team Plasma will\r\nrelease their Pokémon.\c\nThen that number will become a hundred,\nthen a thousand...\c\nIn no time, even the Gym Leaders and the\nChampion will become unable to fight us.\c\nHaving a Pokémon will be considered\na bad thing!\c\nEven people like the sad little Bianca,\nwhose Pokémon was stolen in Castelia,\r\nwill be unable to face public opinion\r\nand will release their Pokémon!\c\nThat's the kind of world we'll make!\c
You may have the Stone, but there's no\nchance whatsoever that the legendary\r\nPokémon will accept you as the hero.\c\nSo, if you're not willing to hand over\nyour precious Pokémon, I suggest you\r\nsearch for some courage--\r\nbecause you're going to need it!\c
When I was running around trying\nto outrun the trains,\r\nI got overheated. Phew!\c\nAnyway, please take this!\c

Oh! A Trainer!\c\nLet me introduce myself. I am a member\nof the Hip Waders. As its name suggests,\r\nit's a fishing club!\c\nWhy don't you join up and enjoy\nsome fishing?
Hey, Trainer!\c\nWhy don't you join the Hip Waders\nand do some fishing?
That's the way the tide turns, huh?\c\nBut, I won't give up. If you change your\nmind, come see me again!
Awesome! Now you are the second member\nof the Hip Waders!\c
Here we go! I'll announce the\nOfficial Hip Waders Catch of the Day!\c\nThe Pokémon we're fishing for\ntoday is [VAR 0101(0000)]!\r\nIf you catch one, please show it to me!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day\nis [VAR 0101(0000)]!\r\nHave you caught one already?
That's great! Show it to me!\c
Oh! This is a great [VAR 0101(0000)]!\c\nThat's why you're the second member of\nthe Hip Waders!\c\nCool! Take these with you!\c
Oh! This is a great [VAR 0101(0000)]!\c\n...But when it comes to the\nOfficial Hip Waders Catch of the Day,\r\na Pokémon you caught before today\r\ndoesn't count. Sorry!
Oh! This is a great [VAR 0101(0000)]!\c\nBut it's not the Official Hip Waders\nCatch of the Day. Sorry!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day\nis [VAR 0101(0000)]!\r\nI'm counting on you, Member No. 2!
The appeal of fishing...\c\nThat's something you have to discover\nthrough experience, rather than\r\nlistening to me explaining about it!\c\nRight, Member No. 2?
Yo! Member No. 2!\nTimes have changed...\c\nThat's right! Because today is a new day,\nwe've got a new Official Hip Waders\r\nCatch of the Day! Isn't it exciting?\c

Soda Pop tastes even better\nwhen I drink it on the bridge.\r\nSo I often share one with Krokorok.

Isn't it great that this house is on\nthe bridge?

From the day Ghetsis saved our lives,\nwe have sworn to be loyal to him.\c\nEven now, after he ordered\nus not to search for him.\c
Also, Ghetsis said to give you this...\c

Ghetsis...\nWhere did he find these?\r\nWhat was he planning to do with them?\r\nWhy did he give them to you?\r\nThere's no way to know now.\c\nIs he testing you?\nOr...using you?\c
We, the Shadow Triad, have always\nbeen and will always be the\r\nloyal servants of Ghetsis.\c\nAnd Ghetsis's ambitions will never cease!\c

How is your Pokédex coming along?\nCan I see it?
Let me see...\c\nOh, you've seen [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon in the\nUnova region!
Let me see...\c\nOh, you've caught [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon in the\nUnova region!
This Pokédex is full of memories from your\njourney. It's a treasure you can cherish\r\nfor your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you\nshould try walking through tall grass!\c
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now!\nYou're getting off to a good start!\c
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't\ngive up! Keep checking the tall grass.\c
Some Pokémon are only found in\ncertain caves!\c\nYou might want to go back and search\ncaves you've already passed through.\c
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon.\c\nSo battling them is a great way to fill up\nyour Pokédex, too!\c
Wow, it's getting really full!\c\nI'm sure looking over your Pokédex will\nbring back memories of your journey.\c
Over 100 Pokémon...\c\nIt's so much fun looking over all their\ndifferent characteristics!\c
That is an excellent Pokédex!\nJust a little more and it will be full!\c
What a wonderful Pokédex!\nA little more work, and it'll be complete!\c\nI'm really glad I asked you to do this!\c
Amazing! Truly amazing!\c\nYou've met all of the Pokémon in the\nUnova region!\c\nCongratulations!\c\nNow here's your next challenge: see how\nmany of those Pokémon you can catch!\r\nI'll keep evaluating for you!\c
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\c\nI have something I want to give you!\nPlease come to the lab when you can.
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\c\nHere! This is a gift to thank you for all\nyour hard work!\c
False Swipe is a move that is very helpful\nfor catching Pokémon, because it keeps\r\nthe target from fainting!\c
Protect is a move that completely\nprevents an attack from hitting!\c\nWell, there are a few exceptions. Some\nmoves, like Feint, can still hit even if\r\nProtect is used.\c
Hidden Power is a mysterious move. Its\ntype and power change depending on the\r\nPokémon that learns it!\c
Try using this, too!\c
Keep up the good work!
Little by little, more detailed information\nis being entered into the Pokédex!\r\nDo your best!\c
Are you trying out different kinds of\nPoké Balls for your captures?\c\nThey come in lots of varieties, so be sure\nto use the right one at the right time!\c
If you read the Pokédex descriptions,\nyou can learn a lot of unexpected facts\r\nabout Pokémon! It's fun!\c
Evolving Pokémon is another important\nway to fill up your Pokédex. It's not\r\njust about catching them!\c
Trading Pokémon with friends also\ncounts as catching them!\c
When you've met this many Pokémon, do\nyou have trouble picking which ones to\r\ntravel with?\c
This is a very thorough Pokédex.\nIt will help my research, too!\c
You've caught so many Pokémon.\nYou might know more than me now!\c\nI'm rooting for you to complete\nyour Pokédex!\c
With just a little more effort, you will\ncomplete a perfect Pokédex!\r\nYou've come this far, so do your best!\c
Amazing! Absolutely amazing!\c\nYou've caught every Pokémon\nin the Unova region!\c\nCongratulations!!\c
So you're here to show me how your\nPokédex is coming along, right?
I see!\c\nYou've caught [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon, then...
Oh, really...\c\nIf you want me to have a look at\nyour Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than\n600 Pokémon!\c\nYou'll have to be persistent and\ncatch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places\nyou've already been.\c\nRetrace your steps in the Unova region\nand see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon,\nyou first have to reduce its HP.\c\nYou're pretty good at this now,\nbut don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care?\c\nI've heard that some Pokémon can only be\ncaught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod?\c\nThere are many Pokémon that live in the\nwater. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe?\c\nFalse Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of\nthe targeted Pokémon's HP.\c\nIt's great for catching, because it\ndoesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look?\c\nIf you use Mean Look on a Pokémon,\nit can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to\nevolve. Some Pokémon even evolve\r\nthrough friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks?\c\nBig groups of Pokémon appear during a\nmass outbreak. It's a great chance to\r\ncatch them!
You've caught more than 400\ndifferent Pokémon?!\c\nThat's incredible!\nYou're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon\nevolve when they are leveled up\r\nin a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon...\c\nMy, the variation of these beings called\nPokémon certainly is surprising!\c\nAnd the fact that you've caught so many\ndifferent kinds... That's pretty\r\nsurprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab\non Route 15?\c\nMastering a facility like that is an\naccomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete\nyour Pokédex, huh?\c\nCatching this many Pokémon must mean...\nYou really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex.\c\nHow about it? Would you research Pokémon\nwith me?
Oh! Just a little more until your\nPokédex is complete!\c\nMake sure you go after the roaming\nPokémon and trade with friends to get\r\nthe ones you're missing!
...\n...\c\nThis blows me away! It's so wonderful,\nI'm at a loss for words.\c\nYou... You've accomplished something\ntruly outstanding.\c\nFilling up the National Pokédex makes you\na Trainer among Trainers!\c\nI'm so happy I was able to meet a\nfantastic Trainer like you!\r\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Welcome to the Pokémon Musical!\c\nThis is a changing room for Dress Up only.\nWould you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
This way, please!\c
Would you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
What would you like me to explain?
What's the Pokémon Musical?
The Pokémon Musical is a show where\nPokémon wearing Props perform on stage.\r\nAnyone can participate!\c\nWe encourage all Trainers to show the\nworld how charming their Pokémon are!\c\nThe audience is looking forward to seeing\nhow you Dress Up your Pokémon, and how\r\nyour Pokémon perform!\c
How to Participate
You can join the musical from any of the\nthree reception areas.\c\nThe reception area in the center is for\nparticipating alone.\c\nWhen you participate alone, you will\nbe joined by other Trainers from around\r\nthe Unova region.\c\nIf you want to put on a musical with your\nfriends, go to the left reception area.\c\nYou'll be asked to pick a Leader who\nwill choose which show to perform,\r\nand the others will join the group.\c\nThe reception area to the right is where\nyou go to Dress Up only.\c
Eligible Pokémon
The Pokémon that will participate in the\nmusical are chosen from your party at\r\nthe reception area.\c\nBecause of their shape, some Pokémon\nhave a hard time wearing certain Props.\c\nYou might want to try Dress Up in the\nchanging room first if you're worried!\c
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part!

You can choose which show to perform\nwhen you participate in the musical.\c\nThere is no need for Trainers to give\ncommands, but if your Pokémon is carrying\r\na Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop\r\nto show off and appeal to the audience.\c\nDepending on how you Dress Up your\nPokémon, the reactions from the audience\r\nwill change!\c

Hey, le Trainer fantastique! Want to be\npart of the experiment of the century?\c\nYou need two DS systems to play with\nPoké Transfer!\c\nDo you have a second DS system that you\ncan use?
If you decide that you want to play with\nPoké Transfer sometime, you're welcome\r\nto come back and ask me.
I'm sorry! Sumimasen! But you don't have\nenough space in your PC Box.\c\nPlease make room for six Pokémon and\ntry again.
OK! But just remember! ¡Muy importante!\c\nOnce you bring a Pokémon here, you can't\nsend it back. Do you still want to do it?
DS Wireless Communications will\nbe launched.

OK, OK. Come here. Stand right there!\c
Well, let's begin! Allons-y!\c
Great! Molto bene!\c
You're just as skillful as I expected!\nPoké Transfer is working!\c\nBut hey, [VAR 0100(0000)], you can't fool me!\nI bet you can do even better than this.\c\nA Trainer of your caliber can make\nreally good use of Poké Transfer!\c
Wunderbar! Magnifique! Brilliant!\nYour skill is impressive!\c\nThis is the very reason why we scientists\nare doing research!\c\nBut, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I think a Trainer with\nyour experience can make use of it\r\neven more elegantly.\c\nPlease master your genius handling of\nPoké Transfer, and show us how\r\nit's done!\c
Great! Greeeeeeat!\c\nPoké Transfer is making\ntremendous progress!\c\nWell, it's unbelievable! ¡Es gigante!\nI owe everything to you!\c\nPlease assist our research in the\nfuture, too!\c\nPlease feel free to use Poké Transfer\nanytime you want!\c
...\nG...\c\nGreat!\nGreeeat!\c\nF--a--n--t--a--s--t--i--c!\c\nYour handling of Poké Transfer\nis reeeally exhilarating!\c\nOhhhh, our invention is\nnear completion!\c\nCome again very soon!\nCome again immediately!\c\nAnd please show us even more wonderful\nhandling of Poké Transfer!\c
Ohhhhhhhh.\nAny moment! Any moment!\c\nPoké Transfer is only one step away\nfrom going down in history as a\r\nfantastic invention!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAs I thought, my instinct was right...\nYou are a prodigy! A genius!\c\nThere won't be anyone else who can\nhandle Poké Transfer in such a\r\nprofessional manner.\c\nPlease use Poké Transfer anytime you\nwant in the future!\c\nWe will be here any time to continue to do\nfurther research!\c\nIf you want to use Poké Transfer, please\nlet us know!\c
I put the Pokémon you caught\nin your PC Box.\c
But, it seems you could not\ncatch any Pokémon.\c
Ugh...\nThere seems to be a communication error.\c\nI'm afraid you have to try it again!\c
Hi, hello!\c\nYou came here.\nThat means you are a visitor?\c\nHuh? No?\nYou came all the way here?\c\nAh, you are a Trainer?\nAre you in the middle of your journey?\c\nAh, this is your Trainer Card?\c
W-w-what? You!\nYou have all the Gym Badges?!\c
Great!\nYou may be able to...\c
Professor Paaaaaark!\c
Quick, quick!\c
Oh, there you are!\c
Professor!\c\nDo you have a minute?\nI think you do. Listen!\c\nThis kid is a Trainer who has all the\nGym Badges. All of them!\c\nI am sure this Trainer can operate it!\c
I have told you many times.\c\nThis invention is great indeed, but\nwithout a professional Trainer...\c
What? You have the Gym Badges?\nALL of them?!\c
Fantastic!\c\nFantastico!\c
Yahoooooooooooooooo!\c
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable!\nHi, I am Professor Andrew Park!\c\nYou!\nEr...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you willing to\nparticipate in an ambitious experiment\r\nthat will make history?\c\nThis device is called Poké Transfer.\c\nIt connects...blah blah blah...\n...called DS system...meanwhile...\c\n...blah blah...of molecules...and then...\n...while evoking...blah blah...\c\n...ergo, energy particles will...\n...blah blah...and if the frequency...\c\n...as you see...with faraway Pokémon...\n...the Alpha waves...blah blah...\c\n...following which...reach convergence...\n...blah blah...spectacular results!\c
To put it more simply, if you use this\ndevice, you may be able to bring Pokémon\r\nhere from other regions.\c\nBut just for safety's sake, the Pokémon\nyou're transferring shouldn't be holding\r\nanything! So make sure to take their\r\nitems first.\c
...So! You!\c
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer!\c\nWill you participate in the great\nexperiment of the century?\c\nYou need two DS systems to use\nPoké Transfer!\c\nWe will conduct the experiment with\nanother DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when\nyou transfer them. It's safer that way.\c\nIn rare cases, there are Pokémon that\ncannot be transferred, but\r\nProfessor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to\nhave an impact on people in the future...\r\npeople living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer.\c\nWe're keeping a careful eye to make sure\nall the Pokémon have safe travels!

It is believed that dreams and desires of\npeople and Pokémon in Unova swirled into\r\nthe center and were formed into\r\nPass Power.
Maybe people in the past created the\nlandscape of Unova that looks like a\r\nswirl in order to use Pass Power...

People say the ruins of the Entralink\nhave existed since long before we\r\nstarted living with Pokémon.\c\nIt's unbelievable that this power has\nexisted for such a long time.
Huh? Where did everybody go?\c\nI came to the sea with other people, and\nI was playing with them...

Er...\nWho was I again?\c\n...\n...\c\n...Oh, that's right!\nI am the Move Deleter!\c
You've come to make me force your\nPokémon to forget some moves?
Which Pokémon should forget a move?\c
Remember me if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move,\nso it can't be forgotten...\c
What? That's an Egg.\nNo Egg should know any moves.\c
OK, then.\nWhich move should be forgotten?\c
Hm! The move [VAR 0107(0000)]?\nShould that move be forgotten?
It worked perfectly!\c\nYour Pokémon has forgotten the move\n[VAR 0107(0000)] completely.











Which move should\n[VAR 0102(0000)] remember?\c
Should the move [VAR 0107(0001)]\nbe remembered?
Give up trying to make \n[VAR 0102(0000)] remember a move?
[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered the move\n[VAR 0107(0001)] it had forgotten!\c
[VAR 0102(0000)] wants to remember\nthe move [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nBut [VAR 0102(0000)] can't learn more\nthan four moves.\c\nDelete an existing move to make \nroom for [VAR 0107(0001)]?

[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered the move\n[VAR 0107(0001)] it had forgotten!\c
Give up on making the Pokémon\nremember [VAR 0107(0001)]?
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not remember the\nmove [VAR 0107(0001)].\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over one\nHeart Scale in exchange.
Is it OK to forget the\nmove [VAR 0107(0000)]?
Everybody calls me the reminder girl.\c\nI know every move that Pokémon learn\nwhile they're leveling up.\c\nAnd I can make Pokémon remember\nthose moves!\c\nIf you bring me a Heart Scale, I'll make\na Pokémon remember a move.\c
Should a move be remembered?
Which Pokémon should learn it?\c
If any of your Pokémon needs to\nremember a move, bring me a Heart Scale!
Eggs can't remember moves!
This Pokémon hasn't forgotten\nany moves.

Cheren: Professor Juniper, I'm sorry\nto have kept you waiting.\c
Professor Juniper: Now that everyone's\nhere, I'll explain.\c\nThe Pokédex's pages update automatically\nwhenever you meet a Pokémon!\c\nMoreover, it's set up so that\nyou obtain even more information\r\nwhen you catch a Pokémon!\c\nTo make this clear, I'm going to\ndemonstrate how to catch a Pokémon!\c
Professor Juniper: Did you see that,\njust now?\c\nHere's how it goes, step by step.\nFirst, reduce the Pokémon's HP!\c\nPokémon that still have all of\ntheir energy are difficult to catch.\c\nIf you can, use your Pokémon's moves to\nmake the Pokémon you want to catch\r\nfall asleep. Or paralyze it!\c\nAnd to wrap this up in the best way,\nI have a gift for you--some Poké Balls!\c

Professor Juniper: Poké Balls are used\nfor catching Pokémon and for carrying\r\nthe Pokémon you catch!\c\nI'm going on ahead.\nI'll be waiting for you in Accumula Town!\c
Cheren: She forgot to say that Pokémon\njump out at you in the tall grass.\c
I'm heading to Accumula Town, too.\c
Bianca: I think I'll go, too.\c\nI'm looking forward to the next town\nso I can go shopping for Poké Balls!\c
Bianca: Wait a minute!\c\nHey, listen!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], Cheren,\r\nI thought of something fun!\c
Cheren: But we need to get going!\nI'd imagine the professor's waiting, too.\c
Bianca: Would you just listen a sec?\nSeriously!\c\nWhy don't we see who can catch\nthe most Pokémon?\c\nThe person carrying the most Pokémon,\nincluding the one received from\r\nProfessor Juniper, is the winner!\c
Cheren: Huh.\nActually, that sounds interesting.\c\nIt will fill up Pokédex pages, so I'm\nsure it will please the professor, too.\c\nOK, then. Until we reach Accumula Town,\ntake care of healing your Pokémon\r\nat your own house.\c
Bianca: Me and [VAR 0101(0000)]\nwill do the best for sure!\c
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)], are you going to\ncompare yourself with Bianca?\c\nBoth Bianca and I have two Pokémon\nwith us.
Bianca: How about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you want to compare which one\nof us has the most Pokémon with them?
Bianca: Hmm...\nGuess I'll be waiting here, then.\c
Bianca: Wow, [VAR 0200(0000)]?! That's awesome!\c\nAre you excited to have that many\nPokémon with you?\c
Bianca: Seems the number of Pokémon\n[VAR 0100(0000)] has is...\c\nTwo!\nWe all have the same number, then!\c
Bianca: What? What? What?\nYou only have [VAR 0101(0000)]?!\c\nIf you don't catch any Pokémon, won't\n[VAR 0101(0000)] get lonely?\c
Cheren: Incidentally, if you check your\nPokédex, you'll see how many Pokémon\r\nyou've found and how many\r\nyou've caught.\c\nI'm off to Accumula Town!\nThe professor is waiting.\c

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
[VAR 0100(0000)] picked up the Xtransceiver.\c
Cheren: Well, I'm going on ahead.\c
Is your Pokémon's HP all right?\c\nWhen your Pokémon's HP decreases while\nyou're on the road, it can be\r\na big problem, so I'll give you this.\c\nPut it in your Bag's Medicine Case.\c
When your Pokémon's HP decreases,\nthey no longer have the energy to fight.\c\nSo, don't push your Pokémon too hard,\nand let them rest often.
Wild Pokémon are hiding in the tall grass.\nWhat does this mean for you?\c\nIt means when you want to battle\nor capture wild Pokémon,\r\nyou should go walk in the tall grass.

Trainer Tips!\c\n\nPokémon have a source of energy\nfor using moves.\c\nIt's called PP, meaning Power Points.\nThey have PP for each move.\c\nWhen a move has no PP remaining,\nthat Pokémon cannot use that move.\c\nThat's a good time to head for\nthe Pokémon Center!

In my travels, I've helped many people\nlearn to love Pokémon. I think that's\r\nimportant, too.\c\nIf you play with those children,\nyou might gain more of an understanding.\c\nWill you two have a Pokémon battle\nwith those two?\c
Hey, you two. Come\nhere for a moment.\c
Cheren: ...Understood.\c\nBut, before that...\c
Cheren fully healed \n[VAR 0100(0000)]'s Pokémon!
Cheren: OK, let's battle.\c
Alder: Nicely done! You didn't win, but\nthat was a good battle. Your Pokémon\r\nlooked like they were having fun.\c
Young man, if there are people\nlike you who pursue strength,\r\nthere are also people who are\r\nhappy just being with Pokémon.\c\nThere are many different people\nand many different answers.\c\nWhen it comes to what a Champion\nshould be, you and I may hold differing\r\nviews, but so be it! Give it some thought.\c
Alder: It's tremendous that people and\nPokémon, each so different, can\r\nacknowledge each other and be together!
Alder is so strong!\nAnd he's nice to Pokémon!
I was scared of Pokémon, but Alder\ntaught me that they're nice and friendly.
Elesa: Let's roll.\nThe Driftveil Drawbridge is just ahead.\c
Cheren: The Champion is the strongest\nof the strong! That's all there is to it.\c
Cheren: This way.\c
Elesa: Now to contact him...\c
It's me, Elesa.\nPlease lower the drawbridge.\c\nI have a couple of Trainers here\nwho want to challenge you.\c\nOK...\nThanks.\c
Now, watch this!\c
Elesa: I have a TV gig, so I've got to go.\c\nThe Gym Leader of the next town\nmay take some getting used to...\r\nDo your best, both of you.\c
Cheren: What I am is a Trainer.\c\nI prove I'm right by getting stronger\nand winning in battle--\r\neven against the Champion.\c
Excuse me!\nPlease stop right there!\c
The drawbridge is raised right now\nso ships can pass. You can't cross.\c\nIf you make a request to Driftveil's Gym\nLeader, Clay, he could... Well, I'm not\r\nsure how you'd reach him over there...\c\nIf you talk to Nimbasa City's Gym Leader,\nElesa, she might be able to do something.

A bridge would be meaningless\nif no one ever crossed it.\c\nBridges connect the world...\nThat's as solid as a symbol can get.
Hum fiercely! My battle song!\nBattle fiercely! My Pokémon!\c
In battling you, I came to understand...\c\nYou're the best!\nHere! This is for you!\c


If you want your Pokémon to\nhold this Electric Guitar,\r\ngo to the Musical Theater!\r\nCooler than cool!
Cheren: Strength and strength alone\nis what matters in this world.\c\nSo I believed, until I met Alder here.\c
But, winning in Pokémon battles\nisn't all there is to life.\c\nOnce I learned that lesson, my eyes\nwere opened to many different things.\c
We all have our own brand of strength,\npeople and Pokémon both.\c\nThe strength to make our dreams\na reality, the strength to protect\r\nwhat we hold most dear...\c
Why do I think this way now?\nIt's thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nAnd Bianca...\nAnd Alder...\c\nIf only N could see this, too, someday.\c
I'm going to take a long, hard look\nat myself on Victory Road.\c\nI'm going to think about what I can do\nand who I can become...\c\nVisit me sometime, if you want.\nWe'll have a battle like old times.\c
The Pokémon and the performers\nall have amazing moves!
I think being able to make people\nsmile is a super-awesome talent!\c\nThat's why Pokémon are so awesome!\nBecause they can make you smile!
The street performers are my favorites.\nThey're so charming!

Here on Route 6, there's a place called\nMistralton Cave.\c\nSupposedly, deep in that cave you can\nfind an amazing Pokémon called Cobalion,\r\nwho was said to have protected Pokémon\r\nfrom a sea of fire in ancient Unova.\c\nIf you can use a move called Surf\nthat lets you move over the water's\r\nsurface, maybe you can see Cobalion.
I've heard that there are also Pokémon\nthat should be called Cobalion's allies.
Now what should I do?\c\nThe entrance to Chargestone Cave,\njust ahead, is blocked off.\c\nIt's because of a Pokémon called\nGalvantula, and if I don't ask Clay\r\nto do something, there's no way to pass.

This is the Season Research Lab.\c\nTwist Mountain, just beyond Mistralton,\nhas snow, depending on the season.
Some Pokémon change their appearance\ndepending on the season.\c\nCould that also be considered\na type of evolution?
We research changes in nature that\noccur due to the seasons.\c\nConsider the Pokémon called [VAR 0101(0000)],\nwhich lives in this forest.\c\nIts appearance is said to change\naccording to the season.\c\nThis characteristic is of great interest\nto us.\c\nWe want to research this Pokémon and\nobserve its seasonal changes.\c\nThat's why we developed a marvelous\nclimate-control system that transcends\r\nthe seasons and allows us to freely\r\nadjust temperature and humidity!\c
Up to this point, everything has been\nfine...but we are very busy, and we\r\nhaven't really had a chance to catch\r\nmany [VAR 0101(0000)] to study.\c\nSo, this is what we would like to ask you.\nFirst, please capture a [VAR 0101(0000)].\c\nThen, when its appearance changes,\ncould you bring it back to the lab?\c\nThen, when we've confirmed the change to\nthe [VAR 0101(0000)] you bring us, we will also\r\ngo search for that season's [VAR 0101(0000)].\c
How about it?\c\nIf you don't mind, would you please show\nus what [VAR 0101(0000)] looks like now?
[VAR 0101(0000)]'s Spring Form!\c\nThe luster of its body and its coloring is\nlike a flower field in the spring!\c\nThe scent emanating from it is also\nvery floral.\c\nThank you so much! I want to go catch\nmy own [VAR 0101(0000)] right away!

[VAR 0101(0000)]'s Autumn Form!\c\nThe luster of its body and its coloring\nis like a tree-lined road with falling\r\nleaves dancing down!\c\nThe scent emanating from it is also\nlike dry leaves.\c\nThank you so much! I want to go catch\nmy own [VAR 0101(0000)] right away!

Thank you very much!\c\nBut we've already caught\nthat Form of [VAR 0101(0000)].
Oh, I see.\c\nWe would be really grateful if you could\nassist us with our research, but if\r\nyou're too busy...
Oh! It's you!\c\nThanks to you, we've caught all of\nthe Forms of [VAR 0101(0000)].\c\nNow we can thoroughly study the\nrelationship between Pokémon, seasons,\r\nand climate.\c\nThank you very much.\nIt isn't much, but please accept this.\c
This is the only place in the world where\nyou can see [VAR 0101(0000)]'s four seasonal\r\nForms all at one time.\c\nThey've kind of become our mascots!
I hate to say this, but that Pokémon is\nnot the [VAR 0101(0000)] we're looking for.

The Pokémon climbed up the rock wall and\ndisappeared somewhere into the cave...
The strength you exhibited communicating\nwith your Pokémon also got through\r\nto Cobalion.\c\nIf you and your Pokémon train together\nand get even stronger, it will probably\r\nreturn to this place.\c
It seems that thanks to you, Cobalion\nhas sensed a change in the world.\c\nIt's a world where people and Pokémon\nhelp each other and live together.\c\nI believe Cobalion wants to remain\nwith you and travel by your side.\c
The fact that you battled Cobalion and\nyou related to each other should be\r\neasily communicated to Terrakion and\r\nVirizion because of the close bond\r\nbetween the three.\c\nI'm sure they will also give you a chance\nto prove your worth.\c
The obstacles that separated Terrakion\nand Virizion from people are probably\r\ngone now.\c\nWhether you want to search\nfor those two is up to you,\r\nbut they are definitely waiting for you...\c
I saw your skill. It's impressive for one\nso young.\c\nMaybe you're the one...\nHmmm... It may be possible...\c\nHow about it? Will you listen to\nan old man's story?
In the distant past, when Pokémon and\npeople lived in different worlds,\r\na war between people started\r\nan intense fire in a forest where\r\nmany Pokémon lived.\c\nThe Pokémon were surrounded by smoke\nand flames. They were in big trouble.\c\nAnd then, the legends Cobalion,\nTerrakion, and Virizion appeared!\c\nTerrakion used its amazing strength to\ndestroy rocks blocking the\r\nescape route.\c\nVirizion used its quick movements\nto protect Pokémon from looming flames.\c\nAnd Cobalion led the frightened\nPokémon out of the burning woods.\c
The people who started the war were\nrouted by the power of the legends.\c\nBecause of Cobalion, Terrakion, and\nVirizion, the war was ended.\c
When people fight, there's no peace for\nPokémon, either.\c\nThe three legends learned that\nthe deeds of humans could lead\r\nto dire consequences for their world.\c
They cut themselves off from people\nand disappeared.\c\nNo one saw much of them after that, and\nthe three faded into myth...\c
I've been searching for them for\ndecades, and I finally figured out that\r\none of them was deep in this cave.\c\nBut the legendary three do not\ntrust people.\c\nIf people approach, they bare their\nfangs and attack.\c
It can't be helped, because they only\nknow the old world...\c\nThey still don't know the world has\nbecome a place where people and Pokémon\r\ntry to understand and help each other.\c
You seem like you might be able to show\nthem that people and Pokémon can trust\r\neach other and live together.\c\nIf they take another look at people,\nI think they will stop hiding from us...\c
It's not just about bonds between\npeople and Pokémon.\c\nHaving all living things appreciate and\ntrust each other would be best.
If you don't listen to what your elders\nhave to say, I can't expect much\r\nfrom you!\c\nYou shouldn't have come to this place!\nLeave now!\c

[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to want to get out of\nthe Poké Ball!\c\nWill you let it out?
The Poké Ball has stopped moving...
[VAR 0102(0000)] came jumping out!\c
Ooh! That Pokémon! It couldn't be...\c\nA bright red mane...and a lush tail...and\na single, noble horn!\c\nIt's exactly like the old legend!\c
Long ago, when a war between people\nstarted an intense fire in this forest,\r\na single young Pokémon was separated\r\nfrom its parents.\c\nCobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion\nteamed up to take care of this Pokémon.\c
The three acted as its parents and\ntaught it the knowledge and the moves\r\nit needed to survive...\c
The young Pokémon grew rapidly, and\ndeveloped a power that surpassed its\r\nthree caretakers.\c\nHowever... One day, that Pokémon\ndisappeared from the forest.\c\nNo one knows why. But when I think about\nit... Young ones are always reckless and\r\ndrawn to adventure...\c
It looks like they are all happy to see\none another again!\c\nI wonder if those three are trying to\nteach Keldeo something?\c
Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion are\ntrying to teach [VAR 0102(0000)] the new move\r\nSecret Sword!\c\nTeach Secret Sword to [VAR 0102(0000)]?



If it weren't for you, these Pokémon\nnever would have been able to meet again\r\nhere in this forest that holds so many\r\nmemories for them.\c\nI'm sure they are very happy that they\nwere able to meet a Trainer like you.\c
It seems like it's looking for the three\nlegendary Pokémon that raised it:\r\nCobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.\c\nMaybe something will happen if you bring\nthem here, too...\c
How you raise Keldeo is up to you...\c\nSometimes it's necessary to think about\nthings carefully rather than acting on\r\nthe spur of the moment.\c
For Keldeo and the three legendary\nPokémon of the Unova region--Cobalion,\r\nTerrakion, and Virizion--this forest\r\nhas a special meaning.\c\nIt seems like it would be best if you knew\nthis story, as well.\c\nWould you mind listening to an old man's\nstory for a moment?\c
When you want to teach Keldeo this move,\nyou must bring Cobalion, Terrakion,\r\nand Virizion.\c
A verdant forest and clear water... For\nPokémon, this forest is like a paradise.\c\nIt's also very important for people,\nso I want to take good care of it!
Would you like to teach Keldeo this\nmove again?

I come shop at the Shopping Mall a lot\nbecause I want all the TMs!
On the first floor, they sell medicines.\c\nOn the second floor, they sell TMs\nand different kinds of Mail.\c\nOn the third floor, they sell items for\nraising stats and battle items.\c\nI really admire Mr. Clyde, the\nPokémon Gym guide, so I'm practicing\r\nbeing a guide, too!
There are even some people in the mall\nwho will challenge you to battles.
The thing I buy most often is the item\nthat raises a Pokémon's HP, called HP Up.\c\nThere are also a lot of other items that\ncatch my eye.









Good Trainers never use only\nbrute force.\c\nThey think about many different\nstrategies, such as which Pokémon and\r\nmoves to use in battle, or the best time\r\nto use an item.
Playing hide-and-seek would be fun!
Welcome to Shopping Mall Nine!\nIt's called Nine because it's on Route 9.\c\nYou can remember it by thinking of this:\n“Done shopping? Nein!"
Have you heard? There's a cave\nalong Route 9.\c\nI don't know exactly where it is or\nwhat's in it, though.
Hey! Pokémon Trainer!\c\nDo you know about an item called\nthe Thunderstone?
So you know Thunderstones make certain\nPokémon evolve, then? Niiice!\c
Well then, I'll tell you!\c\nIf you use the Thunderstone, it makes\ncertain Pokémon evolve!\c
Meeting here must be fate!\nThis is for you!\c
I've heard a Pokémon called Eelektrik\nevolves with the Thunderstone.

Cheren: ...So that's what you mean.\c\n...You are right that we're all different\nand we should do the things\r\nthat we can do.\c

Cheren: There are as many\ntruths and ideals as there\r\nare people and Pokémon.\c\nThe most important thing is\nthat we help one another out.\c\nThat's why people and Pokémon\nare always by each other's side.\r\nThat's what I've come to think lately...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIf anything happens to you or Alder,\r\nI will do everything I can to help you.\c\nThat's why I have to keep training and\ngetting stronger.\r\nJust...don't be reckless, OK?\c

Iris: Guess what!!\c\nI can teach you the strongest\nDragon-type move!\c\nFun, huh? Want me to\nteach your Pokémon this move?
OK! Well, if you change your mind,\ncome again, OK?
Let me see...\c\nWell, this Pokémon can learn the move,\nbut you need to have a really strong\r\nbond of friendship first.\c\nI don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great!\nOh, but...\c\nYou don't seem to have a\nPokémon that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which Pokémon should\nlearn this move?\c
Um... I'm sorry...\nThat Pokémon can't learn this move!
What?\c\nYou want me to teach the move to an Egg?\nOK, I'll do my best!\c\n...\n...\c\nSorry!\nI think it's impossible!
This one?\c\nUm, but...it looks like this Pokémon\nalready knows [VAR 0107(0000)].
Iris: Draco Meteor's power is\nreally amazing!\c\nBut after you use it, your Sp. Atk stat\ngoes down.

[VAR 0102(0000)] learned\n[VAR 0107(0001)]!
[VAR 0102(0000)] is trying to\nlearn [VAR 0107(0001)]!\c\nBut [VAR 0102(0000)] can't learn more than\nfour moves.\c\nDelete a move to make room\nfor [VAR 0107(0001)]?
Give up on learning the\nmove [VAR 0107(0000)]?
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not learn [VAR 0107(0001)]!
Is it OK to forget the\nmove [VAR 0107(0000)]?
1, [VAR BE02(0014)]2, and[VAR BE02(0014)]... [VAR BE02(0014)]... [VAR BE02(0014)]... Ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0006)]\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] forgot how to\nuse [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nAnd...\c
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0002)]!
Drayden: If you wish, I can teach your\nPokémon the strongest\r\nDragon-type move.\c\nWould you like your Pokémon to learn\nthat move?
Understood.\nCome again if you change your mind.
Hmm...\c\nThis Pokémon can learn this move, but\nyour bond of friendship is not yet\r\nstrong enough.\c\nThat means I cannot teach\nit this move.
I see...\c\nBut there are no Pokémon with\nyou right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should\nlearn this move?\c
I'm very sorry, but...\c\nThis Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but...\nNot even I can teach a move to an Egg.
Hmm... It looks like this Pokémon\nalready knows [VAR 0107(0000)].
Drayden: Draco Meteor's power is\nexceptional, but using it lowers\r\nthe user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought\nyou here...\c\nVery well.\c\nLet me reward your passion with some\nabsolutely astounding moves.\c\nThey're the ultimate moves!\c\nShall I teach them to\nyour Pokémon?

The Pokémon with you can't\nlearn these moves!\c\nGo talk to my wife! Keh!!
Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well.\nVisit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which Pokémon should I teach?\c
That Pokémon can't learn a move!\nGo talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg?\nImpossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your Pokémon\nis not strong enough! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows\nthat move! Keh!
I should teach [VAR 0107(0001)] to\n[VAR 0101(0000)], right? Keh!

Heya!\c\nThe professor gave you a Pokémon to\nstart your journey, right?\c\nIf that Pokémon is still with you, and if\nyou two have a strong bond, there's a\r\nspecial move it can learn...\c\nWant me to teach it a battle combo move?
A special move...\nShould I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so...\nWell, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?\c
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this\nspecial move!\c\nI told ya, it's only for the Pokémon who\nstarted your journey with you.
Teach a move to an Egg?\nWhat kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look\nlike it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon\nalready knows the special move!
Want me to teach [VAR 0107(0001)]\nto [VAR 0101(0000)]?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are\nthe ones you get from the professor!\c\nTo teach all of these Pokémon a\nspecial move, a battle combo move...\r\nThat's my pledge!

Glad you came!\c\nYour [VAR 0102(0000)] and\n[VAR 0102(0001)] are doing just fine.\c\nThe two prefer to play with other\nPokémon more than with each other.
Ah, it's you!\c\nWe were raising your Pokémon,\nand my goodness, were we surprised!\c\nYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\c\nWe don't know how it got there,\nbut your Pokémon had it.\c\nYou do want it, don't you?
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the Egg from\nthe Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
You have no room for it right now...\nCome back when you've made room.
I really will keep it.\nYou do want this Egg, yes?
Well then, I'll hang on to it.\nThanks!
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\nWe can raise Pokémon for you.\c\nWould you like us to raise\nyour Pokémon?
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\c\nWe can raise Pokémon for you.\nWhat do you want to do today?
Very good.\nCome again.
Ah, there you are!\nMy husband was looking for you.
You can't leave your only Pokémon\nwith me! How would you battle?\c\nCome back another time.
Which Pokémon should we raise\nfor you?\c
Now, now.\nThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0102(0000)]\nfor a while.\c
Come back for it later.
We can raise two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like us to raise another?
You have energetic Pokémon.\nDo you want your Pokémon back?
By level, your [VAR 0101(0000)] has\ngrown by about [VAR 0201(0001)].\c
If you want your [VAR 0101(0000)] back,\nit will cost $[VAR 0204(0001)].\r\nDo you want it back?
You don't have enough money...
[VAR 0100(0001)] took [VAR 0101(0000)] back\nfrom the Day-Care Lady.\c
Do you want to take back the other\none, too? 
Huh? Now, now.\c\nIf you leave that Pokémon with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\c\nYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, if I do say so myself.

Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)]! \c\nI understand the feeling.\nI want to go somewhere with\r\nmy Pokémon too, but first\r\nwe have to go thank Professor Juniper.\c\nCome on. The lab is this way!\c
Cheren: I'm sorry, but could you\ngo to Bianca's house?\c\nI'll bet she's spacing out\nlike she usually does.\r\nShe's totally flighty.
Bianca: ...That's a secret, OK?
Cheren: OK!\nLet's go meet the professor.\c
Bianca: Heeey!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], wait up!\c
Bianca: Come on!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], wait up!\c
Mom: Oh, there you are! And...?\nWhat did the professor have to say?\c\nShe asked you to complete the Pokédex?!\nI can't believe it!\c
Well, actually, I can.\nI already knew she was going to ask.\c
That's why I brought you three of\nthese Town Maps. Take them with you!\c
Mom: Here you are, Cheren.\c
Cheren: I'll take good care of it.\c
Mom: And one for you, too, Bianca.\c
Bianca: Th-thank you so much!\c
Mom: As for your room, [VAR 0100(0000)]--\nor what's left of it...\c\nNo need for any of you to worry.\nI'll take care of tidying up.\c\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
Mom: Ah, Pokémon. They are so cute,\nbut they have enough power to destroy\r\na bedroom! They are really something.\c\nWith Pokémon like that at your side,\nyou'll be safe wherever you go!\c
I'll let your parents know!\c\nI hope that, in addition to Pokémon,\nyou'll find lots and lots of places\r\nyou like in the Unova region--\r\nand become wonderful adults!\c\nHave a great trip!\c
Cheren: If I use the Town Map,\nI'll always know where I am...\r\nThat's certainly helpful.\c\nShall we head to Route 1?\nThe professor's waiting.\c
Bianca: Let's go, let's go!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], hurry and come too, OK?\c
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nIt's this way!\c
Cheren: Bianca says if we're starting a\njourney together, she wants us all to\r\ntake our first step at the same time.\c
Bianca: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nLet's all take our first step\non Route 1 together!\c
Cheren: OK, here we go!\c

One, two!\c
The power of science is amazing!\c\nNow you can use infrared to do all\nsorts of things in the blink of an eye!
Do you think traveling with Pokémon\nchanges people?
Me too! Traveling and thinking about many\nthings can definitely make a difference.
You're right! It's fine to just enjoy the\njourney without overthinking it!
I've heard there are a lot of Pokémon\nand many different people in the world.\c\nWhen I hear stories about them,\nI get very excited!
Bianca: Oh! I wonder what will happen!\nIsn't this so exciting?!\c

Bianca: ...I'm sorry.\c\nBy the time I went to get the\nStriaton City Gym Leaders,\r\neverything was over...\c
Cheren: If that's the case...\c\nI let Ghetsis escape when the\nShadow Triad created an opening.\c
Bianca: ...Ghetsis?\nThe Shadow Triad?\c
Cheren: I'll tell you later about what\nhappened in the castle.\c\nIt's more important to ask what you plan\nto do now, Bianca.\c
Bianca: You know what? You know what!\nI'm gonna go to White Forest!\c
Bianca: You know what? You know what!\nI'm gonna go to Black City!\c
Cheren: That's the city on the other side\nof Route 16 when you leave from\r\nNimbasa City. Hmm.\c\nIf you go that way, you might be able to\nmeet all sorts of Pokémon\r\nyou've never seen before.\c
Cedric: Oh!\nWell, this is nice timing!\r\nI see you're all here!\c
Just a moment ago, I got some National\nPokédex data from an acquaintance.\c\nSince you're here, let's upgrade your\nPokédex with the National Pokédex data.\c\nI'm sure you'll be visiting a wider range\nof places. Naturally, that means\r\nyou'll be encountering more Pokémon.\c\nLet me see your Pokédex for a sec!\c
There you go, Bianca!\c
Next up is Cheren!\c
And last, but not least...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]'s Pokédex was upgraded\nwith the National Mode!
Cedric: You can now switch your\nPokédexes to the National Mode Pokédex.\c\nCompleting the National Pokédex will\nsurely be a big challenge.\c\nSo, take your time, enjoy yourselves,\nand meet lots of Pokémon.\c
Bianca: Wow, the National Pokédex...\c\nIt looks like there are tons of Pokémon\nI don't know yet! \c\nOh! Ooh! I want to show Mom and Dad\nmy Pokédex! I gotta go!\c\nLet's meet again somewhere, OK?!\c
Cheren: Huh. Bianca's as impetuous as\never, no matter what is going on.\c
I think I'll travel all the way around\nUnova, starting at Route 1 again.\c\nI'm sure I'll discover lots of new things.\c\nCould be I'll encounter the Seven Sages\nalong the way...\c\nAnd, [VAR 0100(0000)], if we spy each other\nalong the way, let's battle again, OK?\c

Cheren: Yes, thank you!\nPlease excuse us.\c\nCome on.\nLet's go thank Professor Juniper.\c
Cheren: I'll be waiting in front of\nthe Pokémon Research Lab.\c
Bianca: Oh! Wait!\nI've gotta go home first.\c
Thanks for having us over!\c
Mom: My, my, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nPokémon battles are so lively,\naren't they?\c\nI could hear the Pokémon's\ncries clear down here!\c
Hm. That sure reminded me of\nmy first Pokémon battle!\c
Oh, and you know? After a battle,\nyou need to rest your Pokémon!\c
Your Pokémon is looking great!\c\nNow, if you're going out,\ndon't forget your “cross-transceiver"!\c
You're going to thank the\nprofessor too, right?\r\nBetter get going, honey!
Mom: Phew! I'm taking a little break\nfrom cleaning up.\c\nYou and your Pokémon should take\na break, too.\c\nGood Trainers don't push their\nPokémon too hard.\c
Mom: You and your Pokémon should all be\nfilled with energy again!\r\nNow, you can go anywhere!
Mom: I wonder where you'll go next\nand what kind of Pokémon you'll meet.
Mom: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow are your Pokémon?\c\nYou should rest a little!\c\nGood Trainers don't push\ntheir Pokémon too hard.\c
Mom: Great! You and your Pokémon\nlook raring to go, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nBest get back to your journey!
Mom: [VAR 0100(0000)],\nare you being kind to your Pokémon?\c\nPokémon work so hard to help you out!\c\nYou're normally very kind to your\nPokémon, aren't you?
Mom: Now that you mention it...\c\nYour father went on a journey\nwith Pokémon, just as you are!\c\nWe met during his trip...
Mom: How are things going?\c\nHave you caught many Pokémon?\nThat was the professor's request, right?
Mom: I wonder what Cheren and Bianca\nwill find during their travels.\c\nWhat they really want from life...\c\nIf they figure that out for themselves,\nI think their journeys will prove to be\r\nall they could hope for!
Mom: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWelcome home!\c\nSounds like you've been through a lot!\nYou should rest a little bit!\c
Mom: Oh, my!\nYou and your Pokémon look full of bounce!\c\nThis is just a little advice from your\nmother, but...\c\nWhen a Pokémon's energy--um, I mean,\nHP--runs out, hurry to a Pokémon Center\r\nand get it restored.\c\nIt's also a good idea to buy Potions\nat a Pokémon Mart for times when you're\r\nadventuring far from civilization.\c\nPlease be careful!\nHave a good trip!\r\nI'll always be cheering for you!
“Mom": Welcome home, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nSeems like you've been through\nmany amazing things, is it not so?\c
“Mom": Incredible, really.\c\nAmazing, absolutely, meeting these\ntwo Pokémon of legend!\c
“Mom": Ah, ah, this is...\c
“Mom": Oh!\nI still wear my disguise! Pardon!\c\nOr, rather, let me introduce myself.\c
I am a globe-trotting elite of the\nInternational Police.\c\nMy name... Ah, no, I shall inform you\nof my code name only.\c\nMy code name, it is Looker.\nIt is how I am called!\c
Looker: Behind the scenes in this region\nof Unova, an organization called\r\nTeam Plasma conspires...\c\nThis I have heard, and therefore,\nto this region I must come, but...\c
Thanks to the Gym Leaders and to you,\nyes, Team Plasma's castle has fallen.\c\nAnd the members, they have gone upon\ntheir separate ways!\r\nThis is what I hear, most certainly!\c
But, however!\nHowever, but...\c\nThe ones known as the Seven Sages--still,\nthey hide themselves in the Unova region.\c
And so, in the end, it explains why I must\nask this of you, Trainer of amazing skill!\c\nTravel the Unova region and search it up\nand search it down for the Seven Sages!\c\nAlder, the Champion of renown,\nrecommended you to my notice.\c\nAre you willing to help me?
Ah, ah!\c\nYet once more shall I ask!\c\nIf you please, travel the Unova region\nand search it low and high for these\r\nSeven Sages!
Looker: Excellent! I thank you!\c\nNow I feel as if I have perhaps \na million people on my side.\c\nPermit me to give this into your hands!\c
Mom: ...That's a Super Rod, right?\c
Looker: Yes, correct!\nIt is certainly a Super Rod!\c
Mom: Weren't we talking about\nTeam Plasma's Seven Sages?\c\nWhat does this have to do with\nlooking for those people?\c
Looker: I see.\c\nIt is truly [VAR 0100(0000)]'s mama to ask so!\nWhat a magnificent question! I admire it.\c\nIt is my pleasure to answer.\c\nAbsolutely nothing!\c
...
...
Mom: I see...\c
Looker: Yes, I shall provide the\nexplanation of this, the Super Rod!\c\nFirst!\nFace the water and employ the rod!\c\nSecond!\nConcentrate your focal point!\c\nWhen it occurs that these Pokémon bite,\n“!" will indicate. Immediately, reel in!\c\nFor the rest, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI depend upon you!\c

Bianca's Dad: What nonsense is this?\c\nHow could my daughter, who knows\nnothing about the world,\r\nbe going on a journey with Pokémon?
Bianca's Mom: Don't mind my husband,\ndear. He's just being overprotective.\c\nAll children go on adventures\nwith Pokémon.\r\nIt's part of growing up.

Hi there!\nI've been waiting for you young people!\c\nLet me introduce myself again.\nMy name is...\c
Cheren: Professor Juniper?\nWe know your name.\c
Professor Juniper: Come, come, Cheren!\nThis is not a time to take things lightly.\c\nToday is a day to remember always, so\nit's best to behave with some formality.\c\nThat being so, once again, my name is\nProfessor Juniper, and I am researching\r\nwhen and how the creatures called\r\nPokémon came into existence.\c
Oh, that's unusual!\nYou've already had a Pokémon battle!\c\nSo maybe that's why...\c\nIt feels as though your Pokémon have\nalready begun to trust you!\c\nBy the way, would you like to give your\nPokémon a nickname?
Professor Juniper: Uh-huh, I see.\nAre you OK with the nickname [VAR 0102(0000)]?
Professor Juniper: [VAR 0102(0000)] is its\nname. That is such a great name!\c
Professor Juniper: You aren't planning\nto use a nickname? Well, that's fine, too.\c
Professor Juniper: As for why I gave all\nof you Pokémon...\c
Cheren: It's for the Pokédex, right?\c
Bianca: Pokédex?\c
Professor Juniper: I am astonished.\nNice work, Cheren!\c\nYou have already studied Pokémon\nextensively, haven't you?\c\nStill, let me explain everything from the\nbeginning, for everyone's sake.\c
The Pokédex is a high-tech device that\nautomatically records the Pokémon\r\nyou encounter!\c\nSo, I want you three to visit many\nplaces and meet all of the Pokémon\r\nin the Unova region!\c
This is my request.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCheren! Bianca!\c\nYou'll go on an adventure to\ncomplete the Pokédex, will you not?
Professor Juniper: Here is what I need\nfrom you!\c\nWhat I want to hear are the courageous\nwords of people who will blaze new\r\npaths around the world!\c\nI want you three to travel to many\ndistant places and meet all of the\r\nPokémon in the Unova region!
Bianca: OK!\c\nI mean... Yes, professor!\c
Cheren: Thank you very much.\c\nBecause of you, I can become a Pokémon\nTrainer, exactly as I've always wished.\c
Professor Juniper: All of you, thanks!\c\nYou have given me the best\npossible answer!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] obtained the [VAR FF00(0002)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Professor Juniper: Next, I need to teach\nyou how to meet Pokémon.\c\nPlease meet me at Route 1, OK?\c
Bianca: S-since the professor asked us,\nit's OK to go on an adventure, right?\c\nI can explore and maybe find out what\nI want to do in life. I think I'd like that.\c
Cheren: Of course.\c\nWe can travel however we want\nwhile we complete the Pokédex.
Bianca: For some reason,\nmy heart is pounding, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWhat are you and [VAR 0101(0001)] going to do?
Cheren: Finally, I can become\na Pokémon Trainer.\c\nI'll have real battles with other\nTrainers and get stronger. Wait and see!
Professor Juniper: Why, hello,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! How have you been lately?\c
Cedric: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAre you meeting lots of Pokémon?\c\nThere really are lots of Pokémon\nin the Unova region and the\r\nrest of the world!



Cedric: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Skreet! Skreet!
Bianca: Professor Juniper is\nletting me help out.\c\nWhen I was looking at my Pokédex,\nI realized something...\c\nI met so many Pokémon during my journey.\c\nI just want to learn more and more\nand more about the little darlings!\c
Oh yeah! That's right.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], do you know\nabout massive outbreaks of Pokémon?
Bianca: I knew you'd know, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI'm sure you also know that lots of a\ncertain Pokémon appear in the grass all\r\nover, and that if you look at the electric\r\nsigns in the Route gates, you can see\r\nwhere the mass outbreaks are happening\r\nin the Unova region!\c
Bianca: Tee-hee!\nOK, then, I'll tell you about it.\c\nFirst of all, lots of a certain Pokémon\nappear in the grass all over.\c\nIf you look at the electric signs in the\nRoute gates, you can see where the\r\nmass outbreaks are happening in the\r\nUnova region! Isn't that amazing!\c
I have to study lots of Pokémon\nresearch, but I don't mind. This is\r\nthe answer I found during my adventure!\r\nIt's actually a lot of fun!\c\nAnd I have an idea! Every now and then,\ncome have a Pokémon battle with me, OK?\c\n'Cause by doing that, I'll learn\na lot more about Pokémon!
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], did you know this?\c\nIf you give a Pokémon called Feebas\na Prism Scale and trade it with someone,\r\napparently it evolves.\c\nIsn't that amazing?\c\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], did you know this?\c\nIn Pinwheel Forest, there is a rock\nthat's covered in moss.\c\nIt might be related to the rock, I dunno,\nbut there is a Pokémon that evolves\r\nwhen it levels up in Pinwheel Forest!\c\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], did you know this?\c\nDeep in Twist Mountain,\nthere's an ice-covered rock.\c\nThere is a Pokémon that evolves\nwhen it levels up near that rock.\c\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], did you know this?\c\nThere are Pokémon that evolve when they\nlevel up knowing a certain move!\c\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
Bianca: [VAR 0100(0000)], did you know this?\c\nThere are Pokémon that evolve when\nyou give them a certain item and they\r\nlevel up at night!\c\nPokémon sure are mysterious beings,\naren't they?
Bianca: Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWould you have a Pokémon\nbattle with me today?
Bianca: Great! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe're battling indoors, so\ndon't get too worked up!\c
Bianca: Whaaaaat!\c\nWait...\nNo, I'm pretty disappointed...
Bianca: Oh, so you will have a\nPokémon battle with me, then?
Bianca: Phew!\nI'm totally sure, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou're really a strong Trainer.\c\nI love your style of Pokémon\nbattling, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nSomehow your Pokémon look like\nthey're having so much fun!

Please excuse me...\nWe are still preparing.\c\nIf you could continue to be patient...
Please excuse me...\nWe are still preparing.\c\nIf you could continue to be patient...\c

Cheren: Wasn't that the professor\nwaiting in front of the Pokémon Center?\c\nI know about the Pokémon Center\nalready. Anyway, I want to battle soon!\c\nReal battles are the best way to become\nstronger, you know!
Sounds like something's going\non in the plaza!\c
Well, let's have a little look-see.\c
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)], come here a sec.\c
My name is Ghetsis.\c\nI am here representing Team Plasma.\c\nToday, ladies and gentlemen, I would like\nto talk to you about Pokémon liberation.
Huh?
What?
Ghetsis: I'm sure most of you believe\nthat we humans and Pokémon are partners\r\nthat have come to live together because\r\nwe want and need each other.\c\nHowever...\nIs that really the truth?\c\nHave you ever considered that perhaps\nwe humans...\r\nonly assume that this is the truth?\c
Pokémon are subject to the selfish\ncommands of Trainers...\c\nThey get pushed around when they are\nour “partners" at work...\c\nCan anyone say with confidence that\nthere is no truth in what I'm saying?
Yikes!
No way.
I don't know...
Ghetsis: Now, ladies and gentlemen,\nPokémon are different from humans.\c\nThey are living beings that contain\nunknown potential.\c\nThey are living beings from whom we\nhumans have much to learn.\c\nTell me, what is our responsibility toward\nthese wonderful beings called Pokémon?
What could it be?
Liberation?
Ghetsis: That's right!\nWe must liberate the Pokémon!\c\nThen, and only then, will humans\nand Pokémon truly be equals.\c\nEveryone, I end my words here today by\nimploring you to consider the relationship\r\nbetween people and Pokémon...\r\nand the correct way to proceed.\c\nWe sincerely appreciate your attention.\c
Older Man: About that speech...\nWhat do you think we should do?\c
Younger Man: Liberate Pokémon?\nThat's not even possible!\c
???: [VAR BE09(0001)]Your Pokémon...\c\nJust now, it was saying...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Cheren: Slow down. You talk too fast.\c\nAnd what's this about Pokémon...talking?\nThat's an odd thing to say.\c
???: [VAR BE09(0001)]Yes, they're talking.\c\nOh.\nThen, you two can't hear it, either...\r\nHow sad.\c\nMy name is N.[VAR BE09(0001)]\c
Cheren: My name is Cheren,\nand this is [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWe were asked to complete the Pokédex,\nand we just left on our journey.\c\nMy main goal is to become the\nChampion, though.\c
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]The Pokédex, eh?\c\nSo... You're going to confine many, many\nPokémon in Poké Balls for that, then.\c\nI'm a Trainer, too,\nbut I can't help wondering...\c\nAre Pokémon really happy that way?[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], is it?\nLet me hear your Pokémon's voice again![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]As long as Pokémon are confined\nin Poké Balls...\c\nPokémon will never become\nperfect beings.\c\nI have to change the world for\nPokémon, because they're my friends.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Cheren: Huh... Strange guy.\c\nBut I'm not going to worry about it.\c\nTrainers and Pokémon help\neach other out!\c\nListen, I'm going on ahead.\c\nI want to battle the Gym Leader\nin the next town--Striaton City.\c\nAim to battle Gym Leader after\nGym Leader. The best way for a Trainer\r\nto become stronger is to challenge\r\nthe Gym Leaders in each area.\c
What's this?\c\nYou and your Pokémon\nsomehow resemble each other!
Let me give you the benefit of\nmy experience.\c\nYou listening? The number of Pokémon\nyou can take with you at one time is six!
Pokémon do everything in\ntheir power for people.\c\nPeople treat these Pokémon\nwith love and affection.\c\nThat's what I think our\nmutual relationship is.
Beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds...\c\nOh, man. I sure do loooove this place.\nSure makes me feel happy.
Some wild Pokémon jump out of the\ntall grass and attack...\c\nBut you can make friends with those\nPokémon if you reach out to them!

Professor Juniper: A Pokémon Center is a\ntruly incredible place!\c\nDo you know why?\nBecause your Pokémon can be healed!\r\nAnd, what's more, it's absolutely free!\c\nA Pokémon Center is a Trainer's\nbest friend!\c\nHere, [VAR 0100(0000)], give it a try.
Professor Juniper: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWhere are you off to?\c\nHumor me and talk to the lady at the\ncounter. Let her take your Pokémon.\c
Professor Juniper: You should be talking\nto the lady at the counter, not to me...
Bianca: All you need to do is give her\nyour Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)].
Professor Juniper: OK. Now that your\nPokémon have rested, I'll show you how\r\nto use the PC at a Pokémon Center.\c
Professor Juniper: This is the PC.\nIt's free for any Trainer to use.\c\nYou can store Pokémon in your PC Boxes\nor select Pokémon stored in your\r\nPC Boxes to take along with you.\c\nIn addition, if you catch a new Pokémon\nwhile you have six Pokémon traveling\r\nwith you, the Pokémon you just caught is\r\nsent automatically to the PC network!\c\nSurprising, isn't it? Amazing, even.\nHere's something else that's cool.\c\nIf you select my PC, I'll evaluate the\nprogress you've made on your Pokédex!\c
Bianca: Professor...\c\nIt says “Someone's PC"\non the screen. Who is Someone?\c
Professor Juniper: Very good, Bianca.\nThat's a great observation!\c\nGood question, and I'd like to say more,\nbut for now, just ignore that and\r\ngo ahead and use the PC.\c\n“Someone" is the person who made the\nPokémon Storage System.\c\n...Someone I'm sure you'll meet someday!\nOK, let's move on!\c
Professor Juniper: Now, this is the\nPoké Mart.\c\nThis is the place to buy useful items and\nsell the ones you don't need anymore!\c\nThat gentleman over there will\nhelp you with a smile!\c
Professor Juniper: So, let's\nwrap this up.\c\nI've given you the basics of being\na Trainer!\c\nI'm going to head back to Nuvema Town.\c\nOne final thing...\c\nWhen you get to Striaton City, go and\nmeet an inventor named Fennel.\c\nShe's a friend of mine from long ago, and\nI'm sure she'll help you on your way!\c\nBest of luck! I hope that your journeys\nprove to be the adventure of a lifetime!\c
Bianca: Ooh! What should I buy?\c\nPotions and Poké Balls are definitely\nimportant. Ummm...thinking...\c

Welcome to Lacunosa Town.\c\nIn this town, people live as methodically\nas clockwork from morning to night.\c\nIf you live your life soaking up sunlight,\nyou can sleep very well at night.
Well, hello there, young traveler!\c\nWould you like to hear an old story\nof Lacunosa Town?\c\nBear with me, because I'm an old lady who\nlikes telling tales the old-fashioned way!
There's a great big hole at the back\nof this town.\c\nA long time ago, a huge meteor fell from\nthe sky and made the big hole.\c\nA very scary monster was hiding\ninside the meteor!\c\nPeople say the monster appeared in the\nvillage at night, bringing a cold wind, and\r\nit stole away people and Pokémon...\c\nSo the villagers built big walls to keep\nthe monster out and made a rule that\r\nno one could go out after dark.\c
...Of course, nowadays nobody believes in\nsuch things.\c\nBut you know...\c\nEven now, the people of this town\nstay inside after dark.\r\nIsn't that strange?\c\nI guess old stories and old traditions\nhave some influence on our current life.
Oh, well, that's too bad. Come talk to me\nif you're ever in the mood for a story!
At night, a scary monster comes out of\nthe big hole, so you have to go home\r\nand be good!
Along the road ahead, there is a\ncoastline that fishing fans love.\c\nWhirrrrr...plunk!\c\nThat's the sound my fishing rod makes.\nI like to hear it every day!
My grandma loves to tell old stories.\c\nShe makes me listen to her long stories\nall the time!
There are a lot of people in the world,\nand there are just as many different\r\ncharacteristics and ideas.

Along the road ahead, there is a\ncoastline that fishing fans love.\c\nI'm busy, so I won't fish at night, but\nthere may be big fish!
My grandma loves to tell old stories,\nand she makes me listen to her long\r\nstories all the time.\c\nSometimes I just want to go out on my\nown and paint the town red!
Ever since I took a post here, I don't\nreally have anything to do.\c\nI'm so bored! I'm afraid all my policing\nmuscles will shrivel up because I don't\r\nuse them anymore.
My Pokémon always goes out\nto have fun without me.\c\nI wonder where it gets that attitude?
Gahoon! Gahoon!
My work keeps me very busy, and I only\ngo home once a week or so.\c\nI'm sorry to leave my wife lonely, but\nthat's the life of a powerful executive.\c\nOh, this is a souvenir from a business\ntrip, but she does not seem to need it,\r\nso I will give it to you.\c
I leave on a business trip\nagain tomorrow.\c\nI think of myself as a role model\nfor businesspeople.

You have an extremely bored look\non your face!\c\nOK! I'll let you have a very exciting\nPokémon battle with me!
Oh, you are not bored...
Well, if you insist, I'll let you have\nanother very exciting battle\r\nwith me tomorrow!
I like you!\c\nI will let you see a very special thing,\nso follow me!\c
The sea... ♪ It's a source of life... ♪\nThe sea... ♪ It's a lot of water... ♪\c\nSo, teach this move to your Pokémon, and\nyou can dive into the sea!\c
Inside this Hidden Machine is Dive!\c\nThe darkest parts of the sea are called\ndiving points, and if you use Dive there,\r\nyou can dive all the way to the bottom of\r\nthe sea!
The sea!!
Ah, Cynthia...\nWhy are you so Cynthia...?
Even Maids sometimes have to roost.\c\nOh, I was confused! A Pokémon restores\nits HP when it uses the move Roost!\c\nBut for people, it's called resting.
The sunlight is strong...\c\nDepending on the Pokémon, that can be\neither an advantage or a disadvantage.\c\nStrong sunlight makes Fire-type moves\nstronger and Water-type moves weaker.
Yaaaay! Yaaay!\nUndella Town!!
Undella Town\nA Town of Rippling Waves
This big villa belongs to the Riches!

Isn't it great? Isn't it spacious?\c\nThis is my dad's villa, and\nI can use it freely!\c
But when I came here, surprisingly there\nwas nothing to do, so now I'm bored.\c\nAs you may know, my dad is totally\nobsessed with items at the ruins...\c
Hey, you're bored, aren't you?\c\nCome here tomorrow, too!\nI don't mind having a battle with you!

Argh!\nSo frustrating! Whywhywhy?\c
You're awesome!\nI don't mind giving you a little credit!
Oh, you seem to be having fun.\c
How are you, Trainer?\c\nI've been so dreadfully bored in my\nfather's villa! May I join you?\c

None of the Riches is a match for you...\c\nI admire your strength!
Oh, it's quite lively for some reason.\c
I truly appreciate you for having battles\nwith my grandchildren.\c\nAnd now, I'd like to see in what ways\nyour skills exceed theirs.\c
Hoho! Do you have confidence\nin winning against me?\c

Ho, ho. You are genuinely strong!\nYou look dependable!\c
Welcome back, young Trainer.\c\nMy grandchildren are itching to have\nmore battles with you.
Children of today are very strong in\nPokémon battles.\c\nHoho! I wonder if my grandchildren\ncan become Trainers like you?
Hoho!\nPokémon battles bring back memories.\c
I am so excited, my blood is boiling!\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?\c

I didn't expect you to be this strong...\c
It's a complete defeat...\c\nThe Riches sincerely wish every success\nto you in the future.
You! Do you still call yourself\none of the Riches?\c
I am Miles, the next head of the Riches!\nI will protect the honor of our family!\c
No matter how often you try, \nyou cannot defeat me!\c\nI will protect the honor\nof The Riches!\c
You may come back again tomorrow.\c\nHowever, I have no intention of losing\nin the name of the Riches.

Fun in summer...\nBeautiful girls playing in the water...\c\nHey! I'm just thinking out loud.\nPlease don't listen to me!
The best luxury is to enjoy\njust doing nothing.
Phew...\c\nI've been relaxing in Undella Town too\nlong, and I've gotten a little chubby.\c\nIf [VAR 0101(0000)] is by my side, I can get\nsome exercise by training it, and\r\nthat'll help me lose weight.\c\nWould you trade my [VAR 0101(0001)]\nwith [VAR 0101(0000)]?
Phew! All right, let's trade!\c
Phew... Thanks.\c\nPlease take good care of [VAR 0101(0001)].\nIt spent a summer with me.\c\nI will work hard to train your [VAR 0101(0000)]\nand get some exercise!
Phew... What I want is [VAR 0101(0000)].
Phew... That's disappointing.
Hello, there!\nYou kindly traded me that Pokémon, and\r\nnow you can hardly recognize me, eh?\c\nBecause [VAR 0101(0000)] is by my side,\nI've trimmed down a little!

???: What's this?\c
What an uncanny resemblance...\c\nIt's surprising to meet another Trainer\nwho has intense eyes like that\r\nPokémon Trainer.\c\nWhat's your name?\c\n...\c\nOK. I'll remember that!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], nice to meet you.\c\nI'm Cynthia.\nI'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you.\c\nI have an insatiable curiosity for\nresearching Pokémon myths.\c
I'm sure you know about Undella Town's\nAbyssal Ruins, right?\c\nI'm staying here at my friend's villa\nso I can investigate them.\c
In order to get to know each other\nbetter as Pokémon Trainers,\r\nI would like our Pokémon to have a match.\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon,\nmy heart always begins to race...\c\nInteresting...\nMy Pokémon in their Poké Balls are\r\nradiating a happy feeling.\c\nAre you the reason?\nWhat are you?\c
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly\nand rationally, am I right?\c\nWhen you're ready, come and talk to me.\nI'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh.\nYou've had a chance to get ready?\c\nI do want our Pokémon to have a match...\nAre you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation!\nWhat an exceptional battle!\c\nYou certainly bear a resemblance\nto that Trainer who faced Giratina...\c\nOh, pardon me.\nI was just thinking out loud.\c\nI love being here in spring and summer.\c\nI can't stay all year, because there's\nso much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well.\c\nYou're a great Trainer, and it would make\nme happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I love to come here in\nspring and summer.\c\nBut there are a lot of things to\ninvestigate in Sinnoh, as well.\c\nI'd be delighted to see you again.\nYou're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again!\c\nI've got to tell you...\nMy Pokémon are excited to battle yours.\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun!\nNo holds barred!\c
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity.\c\nSummers in Undella Town make me feel like\nI'm on holiday. I forget about battling!\c\nBut in spring, I feel like getting\nworked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are\nexcited about battling your Pokémon...\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For some reason, this reminds me\nof a time when I told a Trainer like you\r\nto go see many, many more places\r\nand to meet many more Pokémon.\c\nFor me, it has really been worthwhile to\ncome all the way to far Unova.\c\nWhy? Because...\nI met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the\nfullest, people and Pokémon need\r\nthe chance to throw themselves into\r\nbattle against the fiercest opposition.\c\nThat's why I want to battle you.\nHow about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle,\nI'll learn more about you\r\nand how you've taken care of them.\c
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed.\c\nI know you can battle on bigger\nstages than you've done so far!\c\nIt's so plain to me that your light can\nshine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared?\c\nLet's battle at full strength and see\nhow bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle\nthem to learn about the kind of people\r\nthey are. Observe the Pokémon they\r\nchoose, which moves they taught them,\r\nand which items the Pokémon hold.\c\nYou don't need words at such times...\c\nIf you want to know more about me...\nCome to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: Having everything go your way\nis the road to disillusionment.\c\nKnowing the difference between what's\nimpossible and what's possible...\c\nI used to know someone who \ntalked about that a lot.
Caitlin: No matter how hard I try,\nI cannot defeat Cynthia.\c\nBefore, I would have exploded with rage.\c\nNow, I have the tranquility to reflect on\nmy performance to see how I can improve.
Caitlin: Tell me something.\nAre you familiar with Battle Castles?\c\nYou can find them in Johto and Sinnoh,\nso challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa.\c\nI have villas all over the world,\nand I allow Cynthia to use them.\c\nYou are welcome to come and play\nwhenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all\nis better than having psychic powers\r\nyou can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels,\nif I don't have enough input,\r\nmy output suffers.\c\nIt's the same thing for Trainers.\c\nTo grow stronger, Trainers need to have\ncountless battles and learn many things.\c\nThen, they must put what they've learned\nto the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing...\nSilver Wing...\r\nThey stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World...\nand the single Pokémon found there...\r\nWhat an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research\nI do, I still have no clue.\c\nHow old do you think Cynthia is?\nAny idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a\ncertain Pokémon in mind.\c\nDo you get it?\nUsing your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming\nstronger than you are now?\c\nMy answer is simply loving Pokémon\nwith all your heart.\c\nThat's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: Once every few years,\nthe Champions of each region gather\r\nand compete to see who is the strongest!\c\nAn interesting idea, don't you agree?
Cynthia: I'd love to live here...\c\nBut if I did, there would be a mountain\nof research materials piled up...\c\nAm I right? Cynthia, enough for now!\nNext time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem.\c\nI have a white swimsuit and\na black swimsuit...\r\nWhich one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult.\c\nI was greedy and brought\na lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick\r\nwhich one to wear.
Iris: Oh, hey!\nDid you see Cynthia's Garchomp?\c\nIt's too cute!
Iris: Soon, Drayden and I are going\nto ride the cruise ship!\c\nCastelia City is wall-to-wall people,\nbut if I'm with him, I'll be OK!
Iris: Sometimes I think about the village\nwhere I was born, but I'm totally OK!\c\nBecause I met lots of Pokémon--\nand all of you!
Iris: Look! Look! It's the ocean!
Iris: The ocean is so pretty. I love it!\nSo I stayed underwater a long time.\r\nI made everyone worry!
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but\nPokémon battles are a different story!\c\nIf you're not super prepared,\nyour battles with Electric types\r\nwill leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after\nsafely passing through a rain cloud\r\nin a violent rainstorm...\c\nSomeday, I'd like to share\nthat moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that.\c\nWhen it comes to swimsuits...\c\nYou're either about self-composure\nor you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop,\nskip, and a jump if I use my cargo plane.\c\nBut... I also love to travel the sky\nwith a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm...\nSwimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people\nto draw out a Pokémon's charm\r\nif they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City?\c\nYou know it runs on energy generated\nby Electric-type Pokémon?\c\n...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries\nis bad for your body and spirit.\c\nThat's when you must short out your\nlogic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word...\nWithout even a whisper...\c\nMy Pokémon connect me to other Trainers,\ntransmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly, \nswimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
Lenora: Aren't Fossils amazing?\c\nAlthough they are not alive and\ncannot speak, they tell us so much\r\nabout the era in which they lived.\c\nHee, hee.\nIt was Professor Juniper who said that.
Lenora: TMs can be used as many times\nas you wish, to be sure.\c\nIf you teach Retaliate to many different\nPokémon, eventually you should find\r\nthe perfect Pokémon for it!
Lenora: When I was a little girl,\nmy dad, who was a miner, would\r\nalways bring back bones for me.\c\nMy young heart was captured by bones!\nBefore I knew it, I was a researcher.
Lenora: Recently, a girl named Bianca\ncame to ask me about Pokémon.\c\nA Trainer's curiosity is insatiable\nat any stage.
Lenora: Cynthia is a famous archeologist.\c\nIn the course of our research, we have\nshared many academic conversations.

A beautiful tune is spreading\nthroughout the town...
Anville Town\nRolling Out the Steel Rails
It's a subway map of the Unova region.\c
Oh, are you also curious about\nthat train?
Unfortunately, no train has\ncome here today.\c
See the train there?
All righty!\nLet me explain!\c
All righty!\nAll aboard!\c
Oh, that's a shame.\c
Hahaha!\nYou're right.\c
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train!\nIt runs faster than a rocket!\r\nIt runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest\ntrain in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train!\nThis is a mass-produced car\r\nfrom a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train!\nFew cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train!\nThis is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train!\nIt is the fastest long-distance\r\nhigh-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to\nAnville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran\na long time ago.
This train car is a new train\nto run in the future!
I can see!\nI can see it!\c\nThat lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish\nI could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the\nUnova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train,\nbecause they revised all the parts\r\nto drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train,\nthe number of parts was reduced\r\nso it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design!\nBeauty and utility working together!\c\nThat kind of beautility is unique to\nmass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future\nmass-produced cars that will replace\r\nthe old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration!\nAutomated train-car controls!\r\nIt's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car.\nIts body tilts while going around curves,\r\nso it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy.\nWhen it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it\nhas more parts, so I heard it was\r\ndifficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool!\nThe latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot\ntouch the Hyperspeed Train!\c\nIt really is hyper technology!\c\nAs you can see, we engineers are\nalways seriously dreaming that someday\r\nthe dream will become a reality!\c
Do you know Tubeline Bridge?\c\nThe train that runs on it is\nthis Single Train.\c
Newer trains have to be built\nin a way that's both functional\r\nand environmentally friendly.\c\nCompared to the past, they've\nimproved significantly.\c
The number of parts influences the\nbudget and construction time.\c\nThe streamlined and beautiful design\nof the Double Train is still valued today.\c
It uses the same train car\nas a Super Single Train.\c\nThe only difference is the appearance.\c\nIt is a superb train car that will go down\nin the history of the Battle Subway!\c
The technology born during the creation\nof this train car made the Super Single\r\nTrain and Super Double Train possible!\c
Also, a regeneration brake system,\na car-body tilting system,\r\na whatchamacallit system,\r\na thingamabob system...\c\nI don't remember all the details,\nbut it's just a big festival of all\r\nthe latest technology!\c
Faster! Farther!\nOur engineers' spirits are infused in it!\c
The train car is the same model as a\nSingle Train.\c\nBecause it is an old train car, I hear the\nmaintenance is hard, but it's the one I\r\nalways ride, because I loved it as a kid!\c
The old train cars built with lots of small\nparts have their own unique beauty and\r\nattract a lot of fans.\c\nThose cars no longer run in the\nBattle Subway, but I hear they're still\r\nused in a faraway region.\c\nAh... I'd love to be on that train!\c
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that\nwould be bad!\c\nBut it is full of the latest technologies!\nIt's undergoing a lot of testing.\c\nIt's called a gauge-convertible train.\c\nIt's a sweet car that can adjust its\nwheels to run on any rail!\c
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving\nthe station shortly.\c\nWould you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.\c
This is a quiet town!\nRelax and stay for a while.
Gave the [VAR 0109(0000)] in exchange for\nthe [VAR 0109(0002)]!
Ah... I'm in trouble.\c\nI was so engrossed in my trip that I ran\nout of [VAR 0109(0000)].\c\nLet me see...\nWill you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)]\r\nfor my [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Will you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)]\nfor my [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Great, let's trade!\c
Oh, that's a shame.
Hehe! It was a delightful trade,\nwasn't it?
...Uh-oh. You don't have\nenough [VAR 0109(0000)]s.
...Uh-oh. You don't have enough room for\nthe [VAR 0109(0002)].
I am a [VAR 0109(0000)] collector!\c\nYou, over there! Let's have a\nbusinesslike exchange.\c\nWill you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)] for\nmy [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Will you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)]\nfor my [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Excellent. Let's do business!\c
Why? Do you think this is a bad deal?
Hah! It was a mutually beneficial trade!\nThis is a win-win relationship, right?
Hah! You don't have\nany [VAR 0109(0000)]s.
Hah! You don't have enough room for\nthe [VAR 0109(0002)].
With that face, I bet you have\nsomething I want.\c\nWill you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)] for\nmy [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Will you trade your [VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 0109(0000)] for\nmy [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 0109(0002)]?
Yay!\nThen, let's trade!\c
Oh, it seems I was mistaken...
Ooh-la-la! This luster!\nI really like [VAR 0109(0000)]s.\c\nAn experienced person like me can tell\nthe difference of the luster of each one!
Ooh-la-la!\nYou don't have enough [VAR 0109(0000)]s.
Ooh-la-la! You don't have room for\nthe [VAR 0109(0002)].
It's so lively on weekends!\nOh, me? I came here to watch the trains.
You can trade lots of items.\nIt was surprisingly fun when I tried!
What delicious air!
I wanted to get a picture from\nthis angle!\c
Why do people love trains?\c\nMaybe it's the design, the way they can\nrun so fast and still be so comfortable.\c\nAll the essential parts work together...\nIt's simple but so beautiful!
Trains are so cooooool!\c\nMy mom brought me, but now she's\ntaking pictures somewhere.\c
On weekends, a lot of people come here\nto watch the trains.
They are full of people today, too.\nDo you also trade items?
This is a rare weekend when there aren't\nany trains.
A lot of train cars have a rest here.
If there are a lot of people,\nI feel that the trains are happy!
Today all the train cars are resting!
The girl on the bridge...\c\nShe's playing a lullaby for all the\nsleeping trains of this town.

Anville Town is famous for its turntable.\nYou saw it from the bridge, right?
Lots of people ride on trains, right?\c\nSo the people who drive the trains\nand the people who maintain them\r\nhave a big responsibility!

If you come out on the weekends to watch\nthe trains, there will be a lot of people.
On the weekends, many [VAR 0109(0000)]\ncollectors gather here.\c\nIt must be easier for them to collect\ntheir items because many people who are\r\ntrading different items come here.

Oh ho! With a face like that,\nI'll bet you're a Pokémon Trainer!\c\nI work as a Depot Agent on the\nBattle Subway!\c\nHave you tried challenging the\nBattle Subway yet?\c\nIt's a hot spot for those who want\nsome serious battling action!\c\nBut some people get too wrapped up\nin their battles, and there's no end\r\nto the lost-and-found items.\c\nThat's right. Nobody ever came to\npick this up, so I'll give it to you!\c
I have a lost-and-found item\nthat no one has claimed.\c\nIf you don't mind, could you take it\noff my hands?\c
Oh! I've been waiting for you!\c\nRecently, we've gotten more passengers,\nso there's more lost-and-found items!\c\nNo one has claimed this, so if you don't\nmind, could you take it off my hands?\c
No worries. No worries.\nJust take it!\c\nIt's better for a Trainer to use it than\nfor me to hold on to it.\c\nI'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found\nitem, come get it, OK?\c\nAlso, if you're interested, take on the\nBattle Subway in Nimbasa City!
Oh, my. There's no more room for\nthe [VAR 0109(0000)].\c\nYou'll need to remove some from your Bag\nbefore you can accept any more!

It feels so peaceful here. I love it!
When you're surrounded by trees,\nyou feel like your entire being\r\nhas become one with nature.
City life seems like it would be\nreally nerve racking...
Fresh air!\nA comfortable breeze.\r\nMmmm... This place has everything.
No surprises, no stress--\nthat is the secret of a good life!
Pokémon are the same! They prefer to\nlive in a natural setting, too.
Here, everyone is pleasant and kind\nto everyone else.\c\nI want to work with everyone\nfor the sake of this incredible forest!
The force of nature commands\nour respect.\c\nThe force of nature is what supports\nall life. Nature's bounty brings us\r\nso much goodness.\c\nNature's power surpasses imitation!
Leo: Hello there! Ah... Doesn't it feel\nterrific to enjoy the beauties of nature?\c\nI'm Leo. I come from the Black City\n[VAR 0100(0000)] visited.\c\nNice to meet you!\c
Leo: Hello there!\c\nToday, I woke up to the pleasant rustling\nof leaves in the wind.\r\nThis place is so relaxing!\c
Recently, I've been feeling a certain...\nHm, I don't know...\r\n...Maybe I'm craving the city lights.
Guess what?\nCheck this out!\c\nA Pidgey was eating food\nin the grass right over there!
Silvia: Why, hello!\c\nIsn't this place sublime?\nThe air is so fresh. It's all so tranquil.\c\nI'm Silvia. I'm from the Black City\n[VAR 0100(0000)] visited.\r\nIt's a pleasure to meet you!\c
Silvia: Even if I take off my glasses,\nI'll know exactly where I am.\c\nWhat tells me is the lush greenery\nall around.\c
You know, the time I spend here is lovely,\nbut something's missing...\c\nThat's how I feel.
If my triple-strength glasses don't lie,\nI met a little Wurmple-kins in a spot\r\njust ahead of here!\c\nThis is a special place... So serene!
Dave: 'Sup! Call me Dave!\c\nI used to mix it up a lot with\n[VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City!\c\nNice meetin' ya!\c\nI feel like this place is bold enough to\ntake in a tough guy like me!\c
Dave: 'Sup!\nI've got it goin' on today!\c\nListen up! I'm gonna spread the word\nabout all the awesome things about\r\nnature! With a fierceness!\c
What can I say?\nWhite Forest is too dull.\c\nIt doesn't have enough hustle and bustle\nto keep a guy like me interested.
Aaaaaaaeeeeeeeek!\nIs that a Gastly over there?\c\nOh, whew. It's just your shadow.\nBut I have seen a Gastly recently.
Britney: I'm [VAR 0100(0000)]'s friend Britney.\c\nI'm used to living on the edge\nin Black City!\c
Britney: We're up to our ears in nature\nhere. It sure winds you down.\c\nCouldn't be more different from\nthe freewheelin' life in Black City!\c
Hmm.\c\nNow that I've started to think about it,\nI miss being wild and free in Black City.
Are you searching for Hoppip?\nNo problem! I saw one!\r\nRun through the tall grass and catch it!
Robbie: I'm Robbie from Black City,\nwhere [VAR 0100(0000)] passed through!\r\nNice to meet you!\c\nYou know what? I'd never imagined\na place like this really existed.\c\nIt's nothing but green as far as\nthe eye can see! I'm shocked!\c
Robbie: I was in Black City because I'm\nfascinated by architecture, but being\r\nin a forest is pretty nice, too!\c
Ohhhhhhh, am I bored! So bored!\nI want to go back to Black City!
Oh! You'll never guess!\c\nElekid! I saw an Elekid\nrunning off that way!\c\nMaybe I should chase it!
Miki: Hello!\nMy name's Miki! Nice to meet you!\c\nI battled [VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City!\nSuper tough!\c
Miki: Ahhh, mmm... This place is soothing.\nI read somewhere that the scent of\r\ntrees and grass makes you feel calm,\r\nin an aromatherapy kind of way.\r\nThis place seems to have the same effect!\c
Gosh. Maybe I've become too calm...\n'Cause I'm bored now!\c\nBut that's worth feeling, too,\nfrom time to time.
Wait, what?\nA Togepi just ran behind you right now!
Ryder: Take a deep breath!\nThe air here is so pure and wonderful!\c\nI'm Ryder. I'm from the Black City, where\n[VAR 0100(0000)] visited. Good to meet you.\c
Ryder: Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!\c\nWhen the air is this fresh,\nit gives you extra power for training!\c\nBut it is a bit of a problem not to have\na sparring partner!\c
Hyah... Hyah? Hyah?\c\nI've been having trouble lately\ngetting into my training...\c\nMaybe Black City suits me better...\n
When I was practicing forehand strikes\nwith my Pokémon, a Machop was watching\r\nus in envy. Why don't you go look for it?
Karenna: I got here from Black City\nas fast as I could!\c\nI'm impressed by how [VAR 0100(0000)] fights,\nand I know I still have a long way to go!\c
Karenna: Keep going! Yeah!\nMy Pokémon and I are running!\c
Phew... I'm tired of running!\c\nTime for another battle!\nFor that, back to Black City!
Oh. Are you going to run with me?\c\nI just saw a wild Slakoth.\nIf we go running, maybe you'll meet it.
Doug: Hello, hello! I'm Doug!!\nI came from Black City.\r\nI'm an acquaintance of [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nNow, there's someone who has furious\nPokémon battles!\c
Doug: When I'm surrounded\nby nature, I work!\r\nIt's coming along pretty well!\c
So, I've had a lot of fresh air,\nand I think I'm well refreshed!\c\nI have a lot of other work to do,\nso I want to go to Black City.
Recently, I saw a Shinx in this area!\nYes, just being here refreshes me!
Vincent: Hey, how are you?\c\nIn Black City, I was [VAR 0100(0000)]'s\nsparring partner.\c\nNot too bad of a Trainer, I'd say,\nbut not as strong as I am.\c
Vincent: The vastness of nature\nspices up my life!\c\nYeah, I really have taken a liking to\nthis place.\c
Well, you know, I was born and raised in\nthe city, so maybe I should go home soon.
Recently a Magby was staring at me from\nover there!\c\nIt ran as soon as our gazes met.\nIf it likes me, it should let me know!
Marie: The oxygen is so rich!\nJust like [VAR 0100(0000)] said!\c\nIn a place like this, I'm sure I can focus\nand write my paper!\c
Marie: Fresh air and a good paper...\nOnce I write it, I'll present it in\r\nBlack City!\c
I'm good and refreshed, so I\nwant to go back to Black City.
A few seconds ago, when I was doing some\ndeep-breathing exercises, I saw a\r\nMagnemite imitating me! It made me laugh.
Lena: [VAR 0100(0000)]...?\nSorry. You look like someone I know...\c\nA person I met in Black City and had a\nPokémon battle with...\c
Lena: The plants grow thick and green\nwith the blessing of the soil.\r\nI want to be thankful for this as I walk.\c
People are drawn to man-made things.\nI miss Black City...
It's so peaceful here. I love listening to\nthe Grass-type Pokémon breathing and\r\nthe bird Pokémon chirping...\c\nDid you notice? A Ralts just ran past\nright behind you.
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\nThere is so much to see here!\c\nI just came from Black City, where I met\na Trainer named [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwho was very strong. It was fun!\c
Carlos: Oh! Hello!\c\nI've traveled in many places, but places\nthis close to nature are very rare!\c
But, hmmm... I think it's about time\nto head somewhere else.
Starly!\c\nStarly was just there!\nWhy don't you go look for it?
Molly: So this is White Forest!\nIt's very different from Black City!\c\nHey, do you know a Trainer named\n[VAR 0100(0000)] who is really strong?\c
Molly: I've been traveling, and I've seen\na lot of places, but I have never seen\r\na place this pretty before!\c
This is a pretty place, but maybe\na little boring...
Oh, that's right! An Azurill was running\nhappily toward the grass!\c\nMaybe I should run with the Pokémon\nin the grass!
Frederic: [VAR 0100(0000)]?!\c\n...Oh! My mistake!\c\nI'm very frustrated at losing our\nPokémon battle, so I want a rematch\r\nthe next time I see that Trainer.\c
Frederic: Oh... Have a look at this!\nMy Pokémon is so happy!\c\nPokémon love nature, but...\nI'm the complete opposite!\c
Well, my Pokémon is having fun, but\nI'm starving for some excitement.
Just a second ago, my Pokémon was\nplaying with a wild Budew.\c\nIt ran away when it saw me, but\nit really looked like it was having fun!
Lynette: How are you?\c\nI was in Black City, and I got to battle\n[VAR 0100(0000)], who was really strong!\c\nIt was wonderful.\c
Lynette: This environment with\nnothing but nature is nice, too.\r\nIt's soothing.\c
But I'm a little tired of being out in\nthe countryside.\c\nI want to spend time in a place where\nthere is more stuff.
I saw an Oddish today!\c\nI haven't really seen one before,\nso I was fascinated!
Pierce: Until recently, I was in\nBlack City. I also battled with\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)] there.\c\nI suspect [VAR 0100(0000)] likes White\nForest more than you might suspect.\c
Pierce: Living simply among\nnature and enjoying your own life...\c\nI think that is not a bad way to live.\c
Hmmm...\c\nBut I might be getting tired of\nthe slow life...
Today, I saw a Mareep!\c\nThat's something you could\nonly see in White Forest!
Gene: Nature is great! But I remember\nBlack City sometimes.\c\nMy battle with [VAR 0100(0000)] is an\nimportant memory!\c
Gene: My hobby is meeting Pokémon\nin their natural habitat!\c
But recently, I've been thinking I want\nto test the strength of the Pokémon\r\nI've met.
I met an Aron today! It was really lucky!\c\nWhite Forest definitely fits me\nlike a glove!
Piper: The natural surroundings here are\nvery comfortable.\c\nUntil recently, I was in Black City, and\n[VAR 0100(0000)]'s battling style was\r\nfairly efficient.\c
Piper: Leisurely time passed together\nwith Pokémon...\r\nThings like that are important.\c
But recently, for some reason, leisurely\npassing time like this makes me feel\r\na little impatient.
I spent today with a Bellsprout!\nIt was a precious experience!
Miho: Pokémon in White Forest\nare so adorable!\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0000)], who I met in\nBlack City, was pretty cute too!\c
Miho: Pokémon and this expansive nature!\c\nEveryone is in their natural state,\nand I think it's wonderful!\c
But I might need a little more\nthan just nature.\r\nI have to find more things I want to do!
In nature, Seedot and people can\nbecome friends...\r\nThat sure is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Shane: Everyone is very honest\nin White Forest.\c\nI wonder if [VAR 0100(0000)], who I just met\nin Black City, will like White Forest more\r\nthan you might expect.\c
Shane: Here both Pokémon and\npeople can just be themselves.\c
But I'm worried about how this\nmore honest me will be seen.
I just saw a Rhyhorn over there!\nA Rhyhorn in its natural state... Wow!
Ralph: In White Forest, it's fun how\npeople and Pokémon can deal with\r\none another directly.\c\nBefore, in Black City, I battled\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and we were able to show\r\neach other how we felt!\c\nThat was fun, too!\c
Ralph: I want Pokémon and people to be\nable to face each other directly and\r\nunderstand one another.\c
But I also think I want to promptly\nbe able to show people how I feel!
I met a Lotad over there today!\c\nWe communicated our feelings to each\nother, and I'm still awed by the memory.
Eliza: A lifestyle where you encounter\nnature is fulfilling.\c\nBut when I had a Pokémon battle with\n[VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City, something\r\nabout that made me feel fulfilled, too.\c
Eliza: When you encounter nature,\nyour heart becomes that much richer.\c
But...\c\nJust looking at nature doesn't fulfill\nyour spirit.\c\nThat's what I've been thinking recently.
I saw a Trapinch, and it made\nmy heart happy.
Collin: My success story begins here!\c\nIn Black City, I had a rival named\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but I don't have one here!\c\nI'm going to make a fortune!\c
Collin: I like how everyone here looks\nso happy!\c\nI want to make them even happier with\nmy business!\c
Business opportunities don't just come\nrolling at you so easily.\c\nAhh... I feel like Black City may be a\nbetter fit for me...
Successful people are always looking up!\c\nSo I was looking up while I was walking,\nand I accidentally walked into an Abra.\r\nSorry, Abra!
Ken: I feel that I've grown as a Trainer\nwho can look at Pokémon with a\r\nbroad mindset.\c\nI wonder how [VAR 0100(0000)], who I met in\nBlack City, is doing these days.\c
Ken: Studying many different Pokémon and\ngaining a lot of far-reaching knowledge\r\nwidens your world.\c
But now I'm thinking I'd rather think\nabout just one thing very deeply.
When you have a broad mindset, you\nnotice things about nature and yourself\r\nand about yourself and Pokémon.\c\nI thought that when I saw a Nidoran♂\nover there recently.
Jacques: When you see how many different\nPokémon there are in the world, you\r\nunderstand there are lots of different\r\nanswers to problems, too.\c\nWhen I met [VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City, I\nfelt that Trainer’s way of thinking was\r\none of those answers.\c
Jacques: Several different answers\nexist for each problem.\c\nWatching different Pokémon makes me feel\nthat way.\c
But I want to study something\nwith a more clear, definite answer...
A variety of Pokémon,\na variety of answers.\r\nAll of them equally valid.\c\nI thought that when I saw a\nNidoran♀ over there recently.
Rosa: Here, you can feel growth from\nday to day.\c\nBefore, in Black City, when I battled\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I thought I hadn't grown\r\nat all.\c
Rosa: Watching the growth of nature lets\nyou feel some kind of growth every day.\c
Well, that may be true, but just watching\nnature gets boring sometimes.\c\nI don't have anything to do.
Every day of being alive means many small\nchanges that give the day meaning.\c\nI thought that when I saw\na Whismur recently.
Herman: I've settled in here now, but\nbefore, when I lived in Black City...\c\nPokémon battles with [VAR 0100(0000)]\nsure were fun!\c
Herman: Living here, surrounded by\nnature, is very calming.\c
But it's not like me to stay\nin one place forever.
Oh yeah... I just saw a Porygon!\c\nSo strange to see one here... It must\nhave taken a liking to the forest.\c\nI want to live the slow life here, too!
Emi: Right now, I'm on a leisurely\njourney, but before that, I had a goal:\r\nto win against [VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City.\c
Emi: It's fun to travel as you like, with\nno particular goal in mind.\c
But maybe it's better to have at least\nsome idea of where you're going?
In my travels through this forest, I met\na Happiny! I was so happy!
Grace: The beauty of the Pokémon battle\nI had with [VAR 0100(0000)] in Black City\r\ncan stand up to the beauty of nature!\c
Grace: The beauty created by nature...\nIts grandness exceeds human imagination.\c
The beauty I want to see right now is the\nartistry of human hands.\r\nI can't satisfy that craving here.
The beauty of the Bagon I just saw was\nnatural and good...

Ho! Hoo!\nWelcome to White Forest!\c\nIn White Forest, people live\nin harmony with nature and with Pokémon.\c\nPlease listen to the voice of the forest.\c\nIt's saying “Bienvenue!"\nHo! Hoo! Hoo!\c
I do research into the Pokémon\nthat live in this forest.\c\nIn theory, you should find [VAR 0101(0000)]\nliving in this forest.\c
Hoo!\nThat's [VAR 0101(0000)]!\c\nSo it lives in this forest, too!\c
What's more, you caught it today!\nHo hoo!\c\nThis means there are [VAR 0101(0000)]\nin White Forest.\c\nFor you, my skilled Pokémon catcher--\nthis small trifle. Hoo!\c
If you return here tomorrow, I'm sure\nthe forest will say “Bienvenue" again!
Thank you very much for today.\nSee you again tomorrow!\c\nThe forest is murmuring, “À très vite!"\c
I'm researching the Pokémon\nthat live in this forest. Hoo!\c\nBut there haven't been any Pokémon\nrecently, and the forest is forlorn.
If you see [VAR 0101(0000)] in this forest,\nplease let me know.\c\nThat will be proof that Pokémon\nare living in this forest.
But--that [VAR 0101(0000)] wasn't caught\ntoday, was it? Hoo!\c\nWhat I want to know is whether\n[VAR 0101(0000)] is still living in the forest.\c\nThe forest itself wants to know, too!
Did you notice the sky's beauty today?\nTomorrow will be fine, too!
Let's go Berry picking together!
I need Berries for tomorrow's dinner,\nso go pick some, OK?
Let's have a Triple Battle with the\nPokémon I have worked so hard to raise!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\c\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
Oh... I wanted to see\nthe Pokémon you've raised.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
I have always lived with these Pokémon.\c\nHmm. How would you like to try a\nTriple Battle with me?
In order to have a Triple Battle,\nyou need to have at least three\r\nPokémon able to battle.
Oh...\nI hope I'll get to see them another time!
There are so many things to consider,\nbut that is part of the fun of\r\nTriple Battles!

Have you noticed it's been getting\nwarmer out lately? It's really nice.\c\nHey, want to hang out for a while?\nIf you have time, we could have a battle.\c\nSound good?\c
All right! Lucky me, meeting\na cool dude like you here.\c\nLet's battle right now!\c
Eep, my bad.\nI shouldn't have sprung that on you.\c\nSorry! Forget I asked!
Wow! [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou are so good at Pokémon battles!\c\nI want to ask you something else...\nWill you ride the Ferris wheel with me?\c\nI bet I get just as nervous asking a guy\nas a guy would asking a girl...\c\nYou're OK with that, right? Good! C'mon!\c
Woo, that was fun! I've been wanting to\nride this Ferris wheel for a long time.\c\nBut you have to have two people,\nand I worried that if I went with my\r\nfriend, she'd see how scared I was.\r\nEmbarrassing!\c\nThen you came along!\nHow lucky is that?\c\nOK, I'm still scared of heights, but...\nWith you, it was a little bit easier.\c\nUm... Want to ride it again?
Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How are you?\nWant to hang out for a little while?\c\nWe could have a Pokémon battle\nand ride the Ferris wheel together!\c\nThis time, I kinda think\nI won't get scared!
Hee hee hee. Awesome!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], let's have a\nPokémon battle right now!\c
Oh. Oh well, that's how it goes.\nYou do look kinda busy, [VAR 0100(0000)].
Boy oh boy! [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou are so good at Pokémon battles.\c\nNo matter what I tried, it was all you!\nI'm done with Pokémon battles.\c\nSo, shall we...ride the Ferris wheel?\nEep, don't give me that look! I'll be fine!\r\nI'm calm, cool, and collected.\r\nGoing to be absolutely fine this time!\c\nUh-huh...\c
Aww... That was scary again.\c\nBut, you know, [VAR 0100(0000)], when I'm with\nyou, I can almost enjoy being scared.\c\nIt's like you make it safe anyway.\nHa ha, maybe I'm weird.\c\nI like hanging out with you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI'm looking forward to seeing you again!
It sure is getting nice out.\nThe warmer it gets, the sleepier I feel!\c\nOh, hey, do you have a minute?\c\nI want to ride the Ferris wheel, but it's\ntwo at a time, so I can't go by myself.\c\nYou don't mind riding with me, do you?\c\nI don't have anything to give you in\nexchange, but I've got a great\r\nPokémon I've been raising, so we\r\ncould at least have an awesome battle.
You serious? Aww, thanks!\nYou're awesome!\c\nLet me introduce my Pokémon. It rocks!\c
OK... Sorry to have bothered you.\nI'll find somebody who's not in a rush.\c\nHave a good one!
Er, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Did I get that right?\c\nYou rocked the house!\c\nI know I might not look it, but among\nmy crowd, I've never lost a battle!\c\nHere I was thinking you're just cute, and\nthen, seriously, you ruled the battle!\c\nThat's even cooler!\nRight! Let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!\c
Wh-what?\c\nWhy are you asking if something's wrong?\c\nI'm OK! I'm OK!\nIt's all...good.\c\nAnyway, thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI figured the Ferris wheel was kid stuff.\c\nThe view was great...\nGave me the shivers...\c\nI guess this ride is not too bad\nonce in a while.\c\nIn fact, let's ride it again sometime!\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Oh, hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nW-wanna hang out...maybe...\c\nFeel like...having a Pokémon battle...and\nriding the Ferris wheel?
Did you say y-yes? Seriously!\nCool!\c\nI knew you were awesome\nthe minute I saw you!\c\nReady to battle? Let's go!\c
Oh...\nSorry.\c\nWell, when you're free,\ngive me a shout sometime.\r\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Ugh, ugh, ugh. As usual,\nyou showed no mercy on me.\c\nHave you thought about trying\nto become the Champion?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I think that\ncould be more than a dream for you.\c\nAnd I'll cheer you all the way!\c\nYeah. Anyway...\nLet's go and ride the Ferris wheel!\c
Hmm-mmmm... Hm, hm, hmm...\c\nAh, sorry, sorry...\nI was just thinking.\c\nI feel like... \nWhen I am hanging out with you,\r\ntime passes sooooo fast.\r\nI mean, I was thinking...\r\nHow cruel time can be.\c\nHa ha, forget I said anything!\nThanks for the fun! Let's hang out again!\c\nBye, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Hi, Trainer. Enjoying the summer?\nIt's sure hot today.\c\nThat's summer for ya.\nWhat? You wanna ride the Ferris wheel?\r\nIt's for two at a time, so take a friend.\c\nWhat? You want me to ride it with you?\nSure, I guess. I'll ride with ya...\r\nBut you gotta win a Pokémon battle!
Sure enough.\c\nA little battle practice is a good way\nto spend a summer's day.\c
Oh well. Didn't feel like wasting my time\nriding a Ferris wheel anyway.
Nice job. I'm impressed.\nYou and your Pokémon make a great team.\r\nThanks, that was fun. See ya!\c\nWhat?\nThat's not what I promised?\r\nYou still want to ride the Ferris wheel?\c\nOK, sure enough, I guess...\c
It...uh...it was fun...\nYeah, great view...\c\nWhat? I wasn't looking at the view?\nI was looking at my feet the whole time?\r\nWhat are you talking about?\c\nYou think I'm scared of heights?\nNah. That would be lame.\c\nI hike on mountains way higher than\na silly little Ferris wh-wheel.\c\nC-catch ya later, Trainer!
Oh. You again.\nSummer's about over, you know.\c\nTime to put the hiking boots away. Wait...\nYou want to ride the Ferris wheel again...\c\nEr...\c\nI guess...
If you want me to ride the Ferris wheel,\nyou have to win a Pokémon battle first.\c\nWhat? Don't be ridiculous!\nIt's not an excuse. Why would I need an\r\nexcuse? No Hiker is scared of heights!\c
Oh, you changed your mind? Ha ha ha.\nWell, don't feel bad if you're scared.\r\nLots of people are scared of heights.\c\nNo need to be embarrassed about that.\nMe? Scared? Ya think? Me, a Hiker?\r\nI'm all that and a slice of pie. Got it?\r\nGood. S-see ya!
Y'know, kid, I figured you'd have\nPokémon that were strong and tough!\r\nYou're gonna be a big success!\c\nYep, that was a fun battle. See ya!\c\nWha...?\nYou still wanna ride the Ferris wheel?\c\nEr...\nOK, let's go.\r\nSigh...\c
I-it was... It was fun, eh?\nWhat? I what? I fainted?!\r\nDon't be ridiculous!\c\nI'm a Hiker!\nI'm not scared of heights.\c\nThe only reason I was on the floor\nwas because there was gum on my shoe.\c\nThat's it, kid. I'm out! See ya!
I can't believe how hot it is! Can you?\c\nSay, are you interested in the Ferris\nwheel? I'm here for the same thing!\c\nThe Ferris wheel seats two people,\nso, unfortunately, you can't ride alone.\c\nLet me think. Say, why don't you have\na Pokémon battle with me?\c\nIf you win the battle,\nI wouldn't mind riding with you.\c\nWhat do you say? Battle on?
Sure, sure...\c\nI'm interested in you because you seem\nto be so drawn to the Ferris wheel.\c\nThat being said, I am an Ace Trainer.\nI won't compromise in battle.\c
All right. Just as well for you...
Gah. I hate to admit it...\c\nLosing to you is a complete surprise.\c\nSigh...\nLooks can be deceiving, so they say...\c\nFair enough. As I said earlier,\nI'll ride the Ferris wheel with you.\c\nActually, it's my first Ferris wheel ride.\c
I had no idea.\c\nCall me stupid, but I didn't know\nhow scary altitude could be.\c\nAnd...now I know.\nThanks to you.\r\nI mean, thank you.\r\nThank you for staying calm.\c\nLet me ask you something...\nLet's keep the whole altitude thing\r\nbetween you and me.\c\nAnd then, if you really want to ride the\nFerris wheel again, I'll ride with you.\c\nBeing an Ace Trainer means finding\na way to conquer my fear.
Ah. H-hi.\c\nYou're calling me out to ride\nthe Ferris wheel again?\c\nYou see how I'm acting like it's the\nsimplest thing for me to conquer my fear?\c\nYou can help me out. We'll battle.\c\nYou win, and I'll ride the Ferris wheel\nwith you again.\c\nDo you believe in me?
I knew it!\nI knew you would bet on me!\c\nIf I didn't try to conquer this fear,\nthen I really would be stupid.\r\nLet's get going!\c
I'm letting myself down here.\c\nThis was a chance for me\nto conquer my weakness...\r\nto change my attitude about altitude...
My sincerest thanks for calling me out.\nI'd be a fool to hang on to this fear.\c\nWhen you believe in me,\nI believe in myself and in my ability\r\nto become a truly fearless Ace Trainer.\c\nIt's all up to me... Watch it happen!\c
What are you grinning for?\c\nAm I imagining it, or are you\nlaughing at me?\r\nNice. Nice... Well, thanks for nothing.\c\nI am absolutely sure I will probably\nconquer my fear when the time comes.\r\nBecause I am an Ace Trainer!\c\nBut for now, I'm out.\nBut if you keep thinking about riding\r\nthe Ferris wheel with me again, and you\r\njust can't help yourself, come find me.
It's autumn already.\nSummer goes by so fast...\c\nDo you know what I mean?\nSee the Ferris wheel?\c\nI've ridden it so many times,\nbut now, summer's almost over\r\nand everyone's gone away...\c\nGone to school, gone on journeys.\nAnd I'm still here, all alone.\c\nI'd like to ride one more time,\nbut I need a friend to ride with.\c\nDo me a favor and ride with me?\nIn return,\r\nI'll do my best in a Pokémon battle.
Aww. Ha ha. Thank you, young man.\nYou have a kind heart.\c\nWell, let's have a Pokémon battle!\nLook out! I'll show you how it's done!\c
I see. Pardon me for being so out there.\nI'm sorry for intruding on you,\r\na stranger...
Whoops... That seemed like an easy win!\nI did my best, though.\c\nHa ha. Thanks for the lesson!\nIt was fun.\c\nWell, now...\nReady to ride the Ferris wheel?\c
Boo-hoo...\nThis view reminds me of so many things...\c\nSniff... Oh... I'm fine, I'm fine...\c\nOh...\nI don't even know your name.\c\nWell, do you mind my asking...?\nYour name is [VAR 0100(0000)]... Nice name.\c\nI'll be around here for a while.\nIf you don't mind, I'd be happy if you\r\nrode the Ferris wheel with me again.
Oh, it's you. Hi.\nHow have you been?\c\nAre you here to ride the Ferris wheel?\nI'd love to go again...\c\nWe could have another Pokémon battle...
I'm so glad... Thank you...\nYour kindness really lifts my spirits.\c\nI know you're probably on your way\nsomewhere. Everyone's always busy.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], ready for my best battle?\nLet's see how it goes this time!\c
Whoops, I thought you looked too busy.\c\nSorry to have stopped you.\nSee you...
Oh, my. [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou are really good at Pokémon battles.\c\nA battle with me is not\nchallenging enough, is it?\c\nBut you've been kind enough to battle\nwith me anyway.\r\nI wish I had a...a little brother like you.\c\nSorry, I'm just thinking out loud.\c\nCome on, let's ride the Ferris wheel\nagain! I can't wait!\c
Boo-hoo... [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyour kindness has meant a lot to me.\c\nI don't know why I'm telling you this,\nbut I wish I had a little brother like you.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I feel so alone these days.\nThanks for spending time with me.\c\nI don't know if I'll see you again...\nI hope so, [VAR 0100(0000)]! See you!
It's kinda getting cool...\nI betcha it's gonna get cold soon.\c\nAre you here to ride the Ferris wheel?\c\nMe, too.\nBut you've gotta have two people.\c\nWhat do you wanna do?\nHow about we have a Pokémon battle?\c\nWin, and I'll ride the wheel with you.
Just like that, you say yes?\nYou're kinda confident, hey?\c\nWhatever...\nOne battle will show what's what.\c\nLet's see what you got on your plate!\c
Ack. Whatever.\c\nI'll be around a while if you\nchange your mind.
Whew... I was no match for you.\c\nGuess I was the one who was kinda\nmore confident than I should have been!\c\nI figured I knew my Pokémon battles, but\nyou showed me what is really what!\c\nOK, like I said, one ride on the\nFerris wheel--over easy.\c
Haah! It was so relaxing to talk with you!\c\nIt felt great to really let my hair down\nand have some girl talk for a change.\c\nThat's what I think--sometimes you need\nanother girl to talk to, and that's that.\c\nHey, I'm gonna hang out here for a bit!\c\nIf you feel like it, stop by and we'll talk\nsome more!
Hey! We met the other day!\nGlad to see you! How're you doing?\c\nIf you're not busy, let's hang out again.\c\nWhy don't we have a Pokémon battle\nand chat while riding the Ferris wheel?
Yeah? You good? Yeah!\c\nFor whatever reason, hanging out\nwith you energized me like whoa!\c\nOoh, let's have a Pokémon battle first!\c
Aww. Oh well, if you gotta motor...\nWe'll have another chance to catch up\r\nsometime. Say hi next time, OK?
Sigh... I lost...again!\c\nYou've got a knack for\nhandling Pokémon, too.\r\nI'm just not in your league.\c\nAnd you're smart and pretty and nice...\nI gotta say, I'm totally jealous of you!\c\nCome on, at least we can ride the\nFerris wheel together.\c
Aww... It's over already! I knew it.\c\nWhen I hang out with you,\ntime just seems to zip by!\c\nI probably shouldn't say this,\nbut I don't have a lot of friends...\c\nSo finding someone to do stuff with and,\nyou know, just talk and stuff...\r\nWell, it's really important to me!\c\nUm, thanks for being someone\nI can talk to.\c\nAnytime you wanna hang out, let me know!
It's already cold out.\nIt would be so fun if it snowed.\c\nWhat's the matter?\nDo you wanna go for a ride?\c\nOh, I get it.\c\nYou can't ride 'cause\nyou're all by yourself!\c\nThey don't let you ride this\nFerris wheel by yourself.\c\nHey! I know what!\nI thought of something!\c\nI don't have anything to do\nuntil my dad comes back...\c\nWe could play and have a\nPokémon battle, if you want?\c\nIf you play with me, then we\ncan both ride the Ferris wheel!
You do? You want to play with me?\nHee hee! I'm happy!\c\nFun! Fun! Let's battle!\c
You don't want to play?\nAww. I'm bored!
That was fun! Thank you!\c\nI knew you'd be strong\n'cause you're big!\c\nMy dad is very strong in\nPokémon battles, too!\c\nBut, he's been busy working,\nso he doesn't play with me.\c\nBut you're gonna play with me!\c\nNext, let's ride the Ferris wheel!\c
Yay! That was cool!\nDid you have fun?\c\nIt's been a while since I had fun.\c\nMy dad doesn't take me anywhere lately.\nHe just comes home and sleeps.\c\nSo, I try to have fun here by myself\nuntil my dad comes back.\c\nLet's play some more!
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI have a lot of time!\nDo you have time to play, too?\c\nLet's play!\nAnd let's have a Pokémon battle!\r\nAnd let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Tee hee! Yay! Thank you!\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nUm, OK...\nFirst, let's have a Pokémon battle!\c
Booo!\nAre you busy?\c\nAll grown-ups are busy.\nI am soooooo bored...
Tee hee! That was so fun!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], you're really strong!\c\nI bet you're stronger than my dad\nin Pokémon battles!\c\nUm, OK, next!\nThe Ferris wheel! The Ferris wheel!\c\nHurry up! Let's go!\c
Hee hee! That was fun!\nYou had fun, too. Right? Right?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], you know what?\nI like you 'cause you play with me!\c\nAnd! You know what else?\nUm, it's... I don't like my dad lately.\c\nMy dad and me, we're alone.\nI know he's working hard, but...\c\nI don't like my dad 'cause\nhe doesn't play with me or anything.\c\nI want him to play with me more.\nWait!\c\nYou'll play with me again, right?\c\nRight?\nOK. See ya! Bye-bye!
Hi...\nPretty chilly out, don't you think?\c\nEr... Well...\nI was wondering if you'd think about...\c\nActually, this is the first time I've been\nout of the house in a long time.\c\nSince I'm out anyway, I want to get\nsome exercise for my Pokémon.\c\nAnd I want to ride the Ferris wheel, too.\c\nSo... Want to keep me company?
Really? Yes? OK!\c\nThanks!\nYou seem like a nice person.\c\nLet's start by giving our Pokémon\na little warm-up battle for exercise.\c
OK. Totally understand.\nDidn't mean to intrude on your time.

In a Negotiation Trade, each person\noffers three Pokémon to trade.\c\nThen, each person will choose one of the\nother person's three Pokémon.\c
You can set three conditions in a\nNegotiation Trade: the level of Pokémon\r\nto trade, the Pokémon you want to\r\nreceive, and the Pokémon up for offer.\c\nYou may trade with a person whose\nconditions match yours, or choose\r\nTrade Rendezvous to try another trade\r\nwith a previous trading partner.\c
