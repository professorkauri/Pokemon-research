Hi! I am a humble Maid!\c\nMy master has a big heart to match his\nbig belly. He's a gourmet!\c\nSo I am looking for ingredients that will\nmake his heart jump for joy!\c
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff...\c\nOh, that aroma! It smells so gourmet!\c\nDo you have a wonderful ingredient in\nyour Bag?\r\nWould you consider selling it to me?\c
Oh, it smells so good!\c\nThat [VAR 0109(0000)] of yours is a very\nrare ingredient indeed!\c\nWould you take $[VAR 0207(0001)] for it?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)] and\nreceived $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
Merci! Thank you!!\c\nWith this, I can create a superb menu.\nMy master will be so surprised!
Hmm... This is not quite what I'm\nlooking for.\c\nI don't think my master will be satisfied\nwith such a smell...
Aww... Well, that's OK.\c\nIf you find a gourmet ingredient for me,\nplease let me know!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff...\c\nWell, I don't smell anything interesting\nin your Bag.\c\nBut if you find a gourmet ingredient,\nplease let me know!
Ore, ore, ore...\nOres that I adore!\c\nAh, this is where you should laugh...\c\nAnyway... I will pay you well for\nrare ores.\c\nAnd not just ores! Stones, gems,\nshards...anything mineral! I love it all!\c
Don't you have an adorable ore\nthat shakes my core?\c
Oh, I do adore the ores!\c\nThat [VAR 0109(0000)], it's shaking me!\nWill you sell it for $[VAR 0207(0001)]?
Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)]\nand received $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
The deal is done!\nI've scored an ore I can adore!
Huh? What on earth is this?\c\nYou can't shake my core\nwith an ore so poor!
Hmmm. My core won't change.\nI hope you sell it to me someday.
Don't you have an adorable ore\nthat shakes my core?\c\nHmmmm. You don't seem to have it.\nCome back again.
As you can see,\nI am an ultrarich billionaire!\c\nAnd as you can see,\nmy hobby is to collect rare items!\c\nIn fact, this outfit is ultra expensive\nand rare.\r\nCan you see it? Can you?\c

Turned over the [VAR 0109(0000)]\nand received $[VAR 0207(0001)]!
I got a very good item!\nDon't you think it's great? Don't you?
This is slightly different.\nDon't you think so, too? Don't you?
If you ever change your mind,\nwill you sell me the rare item? Will you?
Actually, it's...\nIt's a rare treasure, Relic Crown!\c\nI was told it was at the innermost part\nof the Abyssal Ruins!\c\nI think it is understandable that you\nwant to treasure it, but will you sell it\r\nto me for $[VAR 0207(0001)]? Will you?
There's something that this billionaire\nwants to get his hands on, even if it\r\nmeans spending a lot of money.\c\nDo you have such a rare item?\nDo you?\c\nGrrr! You don't have a rare item,\ndo you?

Hey, thanks!\c\nI bet I can sell this to a collector for\nway more than I just gave you.\c\nHa! That's business for ya!
Nope, this is no good. Not worth my while.
Hey, come see me if you find something\ncool, got it?\c\nI'll make it worth your while.
What's up?\nDid you find something cool for me?\c\n...Nope, nothing cool in your Bag.\nOh well. Maybe next time!

I wonder how strong this Pokémon\ncould become...\c\nStrength is a measure of worth, right?

This is a delicious restaurant where\nyou can also enjoy Pokémon battles!\c
Well, I'll be!\nThose are some sparkling Gym Badges!\c\nAnd you have eight of them, too!\c\nThose Badges shine so brightly, it's like\nyou're gleaming as much as they are!
I still haven't defeated the\nStriaton City Gym Leaders...\c\nBut that's all right.\c\nI'm going to become such a strong\nTrainer, they'll want to challenge me!
If a Pokémon type and a move type are\nthe same, the move's power will increase!\c\nIf the Pokémon is holding a gem of that\ntype, the move's power goes up yet more!
From the factory's once-busy days, many\ndreams still linger in the Dreamyard.\c\nA Pokémon led there by those dreams\nmay be somewhere about.
When I explain to someone what I learned\nat school, I'm more connected to people,\r\nthanks to Pokémon!
Technical Machines can be used\nover and over, right?\c\nI tried so many different things!\nIt's sure hard to decide, eh?
Er... Um...\c\nGrass-type Pokémon are weak\nagainst Fire-type moves.\c\nThat's why Cilan has trouble\nwinning against Chili!
Er... Um...\c\nWater-type Pokémon are weak\nagainst Grass-type moves.\c\nThat's why Cress has trouble\nwinning against Cilan.
Um... Er...\c\nFire-type Pokémon are weak\nagainst Water-type moves.\c\nThat's why Chili has trouble\nwinning against Cress.
The Gym is gone, but the Dreamyard still\nbustles with Trainers looking to improve!
Hm...\nI'd like to give you this!\c

I'm Chili! My Fire-type Pokémon\nand I are too hot to handle!\c\nWhat it boils down to is\nI want you to be my partner!
Yeeeeooow!\c\nI'm the strongest of us brothers,\nand I'll make sure you win!\c
Aww, man!\nI was all fired up, too!
That's that, then!\nI'm going to show you what\r\nme and my blazing Fire types can do!\c
I was good, too,\nbut you aren't half bad!\c\nHow about it,\nCilan and Cress?\c\nOut of the three of us,\nI'm the strongest Trainer, right?!
Eeeooow! You're intense!\c\nBattling together with you\ngot me all fired up, man!\r\nCome battle again sometime!
You look like you'd be fun to\nbattle together with!\r\nAll right! Team up with me tomorrow!
C'mon! What it boils down to is\nI want you to be my partner!
I'm a Water-type specialist,\nand my name is Cress.\r\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\c\nYou there. Would you be so kind\nas to be my partner in a battle\r\nwith my siblings?
That's wonderful. With me, Cress,\nas your partner, victory is assured.\c
Oh, what's this?\nI'm amazed you turned me, Cress, down.
That is correct!\c\nIt shall be I and my esteemed Water\ntypes that you must face in battle!\c\nLet us begin, then!\c\nEn garde, user of Grass-type Pokémon--\nCilan--and of Fire-type Pokémon--Chili!\c
My attacks flow like water.\c\nYou were blessed with an\namazing partner.
Battling together with you helped\nme find new potential in myself.\r\nThat's what I think.\c\nI'd like it if you were to team up\nwith me tomorrow as well.
Losing made me realize something.\c\nIf I were to team up with you,\nour onslaught would be like a torrent!
What do you think?\nWill you partner up with me\r\nand compete against my siblings?
Um. My name is Cilan.\nI like Grass-type Pokémon.\c\nWe were Gym Leaders, but\nin order to improve ourselves further,\r\nwe are working at this Restaurant\r\nand spending every day with Pokémon.\c\nHow about it? Would you team up with me\nand take part in a Double Battle?
OK. If you're fine with me,\nI will put everything I have into\r\nbeing your partner in battle!\c
...Ah, hmm. I must've timed...\nmy invitation poorly...\c\nTrue enough, I did want to...\nto have a Pokémon battle with you.
OK... So, um,\nI'm Cilan, I like Grass-type Pokémon,\r\nand this is my partner here!\c
OK... So, um,\nI'm Cilan, I like Grass-type Pokémon,\r\nand this was my partner here!
...What a surprise.\nYou...are very strong.\c\nWould you team up with me again sometime?\nThere's still much I want to learn.
During the battle I was so\ntaken with your fighting style,\c\nI almost lost the timing for\ngiving my Pokémon directions!\c\nNext time, I would like to\nteam up with you.
How about it? Would you team up with me\nand take part in a Double Battle?
Hello! I'm giving out water!
Welcome!\c\nThis is a lively restaurant where\nyou can enjoy a show!
Will you come see Striaton Restaurant's\nfamous [VAR 0101(0001)] show?

You want to see the [VAR 0101(0001)] again?\c\nThere are a lot of preparations and\nsuch to make, so come back tomorrow!
Waaatch!
Tch-hooog!
Oh? This show doesn't\nfeature Patrat...
Striaton City's triplets\nmake a fantastic combination!\c\nThe user of Grass-type Pokémon, Cilan,\ncan pick the finest leaves.\c\nThe user of Water-type Pokémon, Cress,\ncan bring the finest water.\c\nThe user of Fire-type Pokémon, Chili, can\nheat water to the perfect temperature.\c\nNow I get it!\nThey can make the perfect tea!
Hey! You've got the...\nOh yeah...\r\nThere's no Trio Badge now!
Let us tell you why the Trio Badge\nno longer exists!\c
The unobtainable Trio Badge...\c\nNo! One day we will make the\nTrio Badge shine again!
I hope today is a special day for you.
A day that's important to me, Cress...\c
Part of my past I want to forget...\nNo, I mustn't forget it.
Welcome to Striaton Restaurant!\c\nThis place used to be a\nPokémon Gym, but a lot happened...
Well, why don't I tell you\nwhat happened...\c
Because of that day, we can\ntruly aim for the top!

Oh, Shaymin!\c\nWhen it comes to Shaymin,\nGracidea flowers are important!\c\nI have a lot of Gracidea flowers,\nso let me share one with you.\c
Since early times in Sinnoh, people\nmade a bouquet of Gracidea flowers\r\nto give someone to show their\r\nfeelings of appreciation.\c\nIsn't that interesting?\c\nBy giving a Gracidea bouquet,\nyou don't have to say a word and\r\nsomeone will know how grateful you are.\c\nQuite a delightful custom!

'Scuse me! Got a minute?\c\nYou look like you know\na lot about Pokémon.\c\nCould you use your knowledge\nto help me out?
Hey, thanks!\nHere's what I'm wondering about.\c\nUsually, Ground-type moves can't hit\na Pokémon with the Levitate Ability.\c\nBut I'm sure there's some way to do it.\nI just can't for the life of me\r\nfigure out how...\c\nI have several ideas, but\nI can't decide which one to try.\c\nThat's why I want to get\nyour opinion on the matter!
Oh... Well, can't be helped.\c\nIf you change your mind,\nI'd still like to pick your brain...
First, I'd like some advice about items.\c\nI want to use Trick or Switcheroo\nto give an item to a Pokémon that\r\nhas the Levitate Ability so I can\r\nhit it with Ground-type moves!\c\nAfter considering which item to give,\nI thought the Iron Ball might work.\r\nI'm not sure, though...\c\nWhat do you think?\nIs the Iron Ball a good idea?
Yes
Sure
Sounds Good
Oh! I knew it!\c\nHearing you say it makes\nme feel much more confident!\c\nPassing the Iron Ball to a\nPokémon with Levitate\r\nmeans Ground-type moves can hit it!\c\nThanks!
I'd like to pick your brain again.\nIs that OK?
I'd like to get your advice on moves.\c\nIf I use a certain move on a Pokémon\nwith the Levitate Ability, and then\r\nuse a Ground-type move on it,\r\nI think that could work.\c\nWhich move should I choose:\nSmack Down, Gravity, or Gastro Acid?
Smack Down
Gravity
Gastro Acid
I see! Smack Down!\c\nThat move will knock a Flying-type\nPokémon or a Pokémon with Levitate\r\nout of the air, so Ground-type moves\r\nwill work on it!\c\nSo if I use Smack Down and then use\na Ground-type move...\c\nI get it now!\nThanks!
I see! Gravity!\c\nThe move Gravity makes gravity stronger,\nso Ground-type moves will work on\r\nPokémon with the Levitate Ability or\r\nFlying-type Pokémon.\c\nSo if I use Gravity and then use\na Ground-type move...\c\nI get it now!\nThanks!
I see! Gastro Acid!\c\nThat's right--Gastro Acid eliminates the\neffects of Abilities.\c\nThat means Levitate won't work anymore!\c\nSo if I use Gastro Acid and then use\na Ground-type move...\c\nI get it now!\nThanks!
Finally, I'd like a little advice\nabout Abilities.\c\nApparently, some Abilities will let you\nhit Pokémon that have Levitate\r\nwith Ground-type moves!\c\nBut...\nI'm not sure which one to use!\c\nMold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze\nall seem like good choices...\c\nI'm close, but I can't decide.\c\nHey! Please decide for me!
Mold Breaker
Teravolt
Turboblaze
So it's Mold Breaker, then?\c\nI guess that's right.\nMold Breaker lets you use moves\r\nregardless of the target's Ability!\c\nLevitate won't matter, so you can land\nhit after hit with Ground-type moves!\c\nMold Breaker's so cool!\nViva Mold Breaker!
So it's Teravolt, then?!\c\nI guess that's right.\nTeravolt lets you use moves\r\nregardless of the target's Ability!\c\nLevitate won't matter, so you can land\nhit after hit with Ground-type moves!\c\nTeravolt's so cool!\nViva Teravolt!
So it's Turboblaze, then?!\c\nI guess that's right.\nTurboblaze lets you use moves\r\nregardless of the target's Ability!\c\nLevitate won't matter, so you can land\nhit after hit with Ground-type moves!\c\nTurboblaze is so cool!\nViva Turboblaze!
Thanks! Because of you,\nI'm prepared for Levitate!\c\nAnd I'm even more prepared\nfor anti-Levitate tactics!\c\nHeh heh heh...\c\nNow, no matter which Pokémon I face,\nvictory is assured for my\r\nlevitating Pokémon!
Well! Do you dare battle my\ninvincible Pokémon with Levitate?
Hmm...\c\nI thought I was completely\nprepared for anti-Levitate tactics...\c\nIn real battles, things never\ngo as well as you would think.\c\nOr maybe you're just that good!
If you want to battle, come talk\nto me again! I'll take you on anytime!
We increased the number of Trainers'\nSchools to meet the demands of\r\nTrainers who want to know\r\nmore about Pokémon because they\r\nlove them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers\ncalled Abilities.\c\nSome work even when the Pokémon\nis not in battle.\c\nFor example, when a Pokémon with the\nSuction Cups or Sticky Hold Ability is at\r\nthe front of your party, you're more\r\nlikely to get a bite when fishing!
The Wide Lens and Zoom Lens are very\nsimilar. Here's the difference.\c\nThe Wide Lens boosts accuracy by 10%!\c\nThe Zoom Lens boosts accuracy by 20%,\nbut only if the holder moves after\r\nthe target.\c\nThat means the Zoom Lens is best for\nslower Pokémon!
Would you like to take a simple quiz?
So here is the question:\c\nWhich of the following Berries\ncures confusion?

OK! The move Swagger raises the target's\nAttack, but it also causes which\r\nstatus condition?
Asleep
Flinch
Confused
Ding ding ding! We have a winner!\nFantastic answer!\c\nHere's a prize for you!\c
Here's a combo you can use in a\nDouble Battle!\c\nHave one of your Pokémon hold a\nPersim Berry.\c\nThen, have the other one use Swagger\non that Pokémon.\c\nIts Attack will go up, and the Berry will\nheal the confusion immediately.\r\nThen it can hit the opponent harder!\c\nThere are many possible combinations\nin Double Battle!

Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton,\nI'm...fascinated.\c
Welcome! I'm Hawes, the\nassistant director.\c\nSince you were kind enough to visit,\nI'll give you a tour of the museum.\c
???: Why, you're [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nYou came all the way out here!\c\nWell now, which do you like better--\nthe Cover Fossil or the Plume Fossil?

The Plume Fossil!\nNow, that's a nice choice!\c\nIf you want to restore it,\ngo to our reception counter!\c
Hawes: Dear!\c\nSuddenly interrupting my tours\nwill surprise the patrons.\c\nOh, and you haven't even\nintroduced yourself yet, have you?\c
Oh, that's right.\c\nI'm Lenora, the director of\nthis museum!\c\nI'm always in my study,\nso come visit if you have time!\c
Oh, that's right.\c\nI'm Lenora, the director of\nthis museum!\c\nI'm always in my study,\nso if you want a Fossil,\r\ndrop by and say hello!\c
Hawes: Oh, dear...\nWell, let's continue our tour.\c\nThis skeleton is of a\nDragon-type Pokémon.\c\nThere's a theory that it had an accident\nwhile it was flying around the world, and\r\nso it became a Fossil.\c
We learned that Deoxys changes\nits Forme by coming into contact\r\nwith the power of meteors.\c
Oh!\nNow, this is a truly interesting artifact!\c\nThis is a replica of that Dark Stone!\c\nHave you heard of the\nDark Stone?\c\nThis is the form of the legendary\nPokémon Zekrom while it rests...\c\nWhat? You've seen Zekrom?\nThat's amazing!\c\nIn that case, my explanation\nis superfluous, isn't it?\c
Oh!\nNow, this is a truly interesting artifact!\c\nThis is a replica of that Light Stone!\c\nHave you heard of the\nLight Stone?\c\nThis is the form of the legendary\nPokémon Reshiram while it rests...\c\nWhat? You've seen Reshiram?\nThat's amazing!\c\nIn that case, my explanation\nis superfluous, isn't it?\c
The library is in the next room.\nBeyond that is the director's room.\c\nBy the way, Lenora is a former\nGym Leader!
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious...\c\nFrom the outside, you can't see their\nfunctional, efficient design.\c\nIt's almost as if it is an embodiment of\ntheir former essence... So fascinating!
Rarities from around the world...\nMuseums are packed with adventure!
I heard that the director, Lenora,\nis too busy with her research\r\non Fossils and Pokémon bones, so she\r\ntook a break from being a Gym Leader.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came\nfrom space along with this meteorite.
The Thick Club held by Marowak...\c\nJust like how Cubone wears\nits mother's skull,\r\nMarowak could also battle with\r\nthe bone of someone dear to it...
You!\nBones can talk!\c
You seem all right,\nbut it's natural for people\r\nto have different opinions.\c\nDon't fight over it--enjoy it.\nConsider why they might think like that!
This is a skeletal specimen from a\nPokémon that flew around the world.
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was\nprotected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus\nattached to it.

This book collects research on\nPokémon bones and fossils.\c\nNot only can we learn about ancient\nPokémon's bodies from bones and fossils,\r\nwe can learn about how people of ancient\r\ntimes interacted with Pokémon.\c\nTo ancient people, Pokémon were a sacred\npresence. They were revered to a much\r\ngreater extent than happens today.
This book introduces the various Pokémon\nthat help out in the world of work.\c\nFor a potter to fire plates and pots in a\nkiln, the temperature must reach 600° F.\c\nThis is where Pansear can help!\c\nIt increases the temperature in its\nprized tuft and fires the pottery!
This book is about how much the\nUnova region has changed in two years.\c\nEach year, many people move to Unova,\nso the environment and cities change\r\nat a dizzying pace.
This book is about the things you\ncan ride in the Unova region,\r\nsuch as Castelia City's cruise ship\r\nand Mistralton City's planes.\c\nBefore there were planes, locomotives\ncarried people all over Unova.\c\nThe railway in Nacrene City is\na legacy of those lines.
This is a book a Backpacker wrote\nabout visiting the Unova region's\r\nfive famous bridges.\c\nThere are around 200 pages dedicated\nto the charms of drinking Lemonade\r\nand watching the cruise ship\r\nfrom the Skyarrow Bridge at sunset.
This is a magazine about the\ngourmet foods in the Unova region.\c\nPeople in the know start out with\nMoomoo Milk and a Village Sandwich.\c\nThen, to finish off the meal, a\nclassic favorite, a Casteliacone!
                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                  
This is a story about a kind but\ncowardly Lillipup.\c\nIn order to save its sick grandmother,\nit goes in search of medicine\r\nin a cave where a scary ghost lives.\c\nThis volume tells the story of how the\ncrybaby Lillipup summons the courage\r\nto set off on its journey.
This is the story of a cowardly Lillipup\nand a short-tempered Zorua.\c\nA violent Zorua blocks the path\nof Lillipup, who is headed to\r\na cave to get medicine.\c\nAfter this, that, and the other thing,\nthe two of them become friends\r\nand decide to travel together.
This is the story of a cowardly Lillipup,\na short-tempered Zorua, and\r\na lonely Yamask.\c\nWhen Lillipup and Zorua enter the cave,\nthey hear a creepy cry!\c\nSticking close to each other, deep into\nthe cave they go.\c\nThey find a Yamask loudly crying.\c\nIt wanted very much to make friends,\nbut everyone was scared of it,\r\nand nobody would be its friend.\c\nAfter this, that, and the other, they\nfigure this out, and the three new\r\nfriends continue into the cave.
This is a story about three pals,\nLillipup, Zorua, and Yamask.\c\nAfter fleeing from a colony of Woobat\nand working together to defeat a\r\nKrokorok that was being a bully, they\r\nfind the medicinal herb Lillipup needs.\c\nThe three of them make a pinky promise\nto play together again, and each returns\r\nhome, although they want to play more.\c\nLillipup gives the medicinal herb to its\ngrandmother, and she feels better! Yay!\c\nFrom then on, the three Pokémon became\nthe best of friends forever, and\r\neveryone lived happily ever after!
I'll read to you from my favorite book--\n“The Mythology of the Sinnoh Region."\c\nLong ago, when Sinnoh had just been\nformed, Pokémon and humans led\r\nseparate lives.\c\nThat is not to say they did not help\none another. Indeed, they did.\c\nThey supplied one another with necessary\nitems, and they supported one another.\c\nOne Pokémon said to the others that they\nshould always be ready to help humans.\c\nIt proposed that Pokémon be ready to\nappear before humans whenever needed.\c\nThus, to this day, Pokémon appear to\nhumans if they venture into tall grass.
This library used to be\na Pokémon Gym!

You and [VAR 0101(0000)] can\nbecome an even more wonderful team!
It's a little bit friendly to you...\nSomething like that.
Hmmm...\nIt may still take some time.
Are you just letting it get\nknocked out in Pokémon battles?!
What's this? Are you a disciplinarian? Or\ndo you plan to use the move Frustration?

Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Skill Swap!\c\nSkill Swap switches your\nAbility with the target's!\c\nNot only can you make an\nadvantageous Ability your own,\r\nyou can dump a harmful Ability\r\nonto your opponent!\c\nThere are some Abilities that you can't\nswap, but be good to it even if it fails!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than After You!\c\nAfter You makes the selected\nPokémon use its move\r\nright after After You is used!\c\nIt doesn't work in Single Battles\nor Rotation Battles.\c\nBut Pokémon using it can make a\nslow ally move faster, or you can\r\nthrow off your opponent's timing!\c\nThis is a great technique for catching\nan opponent off guard!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Magic Room!\c\nMagic Room makes it so items\nheld by Pokémon have no effect\r\nfor five turns after it's used!\c\nYou can stop the effects of items\nthat help your opponent.\c\nPlus, you can get rid of held-item\neffects that hurt your team!\c\nEven better, it interferes with\nmoves like Fling and Natural Gift!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Wonder Room!\c\nWonder Room swaps the Defense and\nSp. Defense of all Pokémon for\r\nfive turns after it's used!\c\nThe best choices for attack and defense\nchange completely, depending on whether\r\nphysical moves or special moves\r\nare effective.\c\nThis move has a monumental effect\non battles!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Sleep Talk!\c\nSleep Talk can only be used\nby a Pokémon that's asleep!\c\nThe Pokémon using Sleep Talk\nrandomly uses any other move\r\nthat it knows!\c\nWith this move, you don't have\nto worry about not being able\r\nto use moves when asleep!

I found a handkerchief.\nI think one of our regulars dropped it.\c\nI think that the customer had a brown\nPokémon that can use Super Fang...\c\nI'm the kind of person who instantly\nforgets about these kinds of things...\c\nIf you don't mind, would you look\nfor the owner of this handkerchief?
Thank you!\nI'll let you hang on to it.\c\nEvery day, we get a lot of different\ncustomers, so all ya gotta do is ask 'em!
Sniff...\c\nI sure want to give this forgotten\nhandkerchief back to its owner...
I think it might have been the customer\nwho had a brown Pokémon\r\nthat can use Super Fang...
What? You found the customer\nwho lost his handkerchief?!\c\nIt was the person with Patrat, you say?\nWhat a relief. Thank you so much!\c\nHere, this is for you!\c
Work is so much fun!\c\nI mean, I get to meet so many\npeople and Pokémon!
It's Monday! I'm drinking a Moomoo Milk\nto get myself stoked up for the week!\c\nIt makes me feel like Krokorok and I\nare both ready to take on another week!
Hm? Did I lose something?\nNo, I don't think so...\c\nI bet it was a customer on another day.
I always come here to relax with Lillipup\nand look at lovely Fossils in the museum.\c\nBy the way, my little Lillipup's\nspecialty is Roar.
What? No, I haven't lost anything.\c\nMy sweet Lillipup can't use\nSuper Fang, either.\c\nPerhaps it was another customer.\c\nMany people come to this café only\non a certain day.
Don't you think my Munna would\nbe a superstar if it was in\r\na Pokémon Musical?\c\nIt's on the path to success, just like\nme and my career as a Pokémon Trainer!
You're looking for someone\nwho lost something? Aren't you nice?\c\nMunna isn't brown, though,\nso it must be a different customer.\c\nI think I might have seen someone with a\nbrown Pokémon on Thursday...
I always come to Café Warehouse\nto relax after Patrat and I go\r\nfor a jog in Pinwheel Forest.\c\nGetting a refreshing drink after\nexercising is just the best! Right?
Huh?\nDid I lose something?\c\nHey! That handkerchief!\nIt's mine!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]\nhanded over the Grubby Hanky!
Thank you so much for\nfinding that for me!\c\nI need that handkerchief so I can wipe\nPatrat's cheeks after it eats Berries.
Wa ha ha! My Watchog has nice fur!\nDoesn't it look impressive?\c\nI always come here to Café Warehouse\nevery week and brag myself silly about it!\c\nIts Super Fang is super cool!
I haven't lost anything.\nWatchog doesn't let anything get by it!\c\nI'm sure whatever it is belongs\nto some other customer.
Taking it easy in the café on weekends\nmakes me forget the stress of workdays.
My! That handkerchief looks just like\nmine, but it belongs to someone else.\c\nIt does have a certain, hmm, ah,\nje ne sais quoi about it.\c\nWhat's with that look?\c\nOK. OK. It smells like a Patrat.

Thanks!
Well, OK. See you again soon!\nDon't forget a feeling of gratitude!
What a wonderful phrase!\nIt warms my heart.\c\nIf somebody helps you,\nshow your feelings of gratitude.\c\nI am sure they will appreciate\nyour feelings.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nIf you complete several survey\nrequests, you can advance in rank!\c\nIf you advance in rank,\npeople will look up to you, and\r\nyou can get something good!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are a B-rank statistician.\c\nYou advanced to the B rank!\nYou've been working hard.\c\nIf you advance in rank,\nyou'll get more new requests, so\r\nyou might want to talk to the leader.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are an A-rank statistician.\c\nYou're already in the A rank.\nThat's awesome!\c\nI also have to work hard\nand take surveys.\c\nI heard requests for the A rank\nwere difficult.\c\nKeep up the good work!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are an S-rank statistician.\c\nYou are close to the S+ rank,\nwhich is the best!\c\nI will support you!\nGood luck.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians?\c\nOh, you are [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou are an S+ rank statistician!\c\nWow! I will also do my best to\nadvance in rank as much as possible!
If you want to check your information,\nlook at the graph on the back wall.\c\nInformation about all the statisticians\nis kept there.\c\nOf course, we checked the information\nabout you!
Have you answered a questionnaire?\c\nYou should at least answer about\nwhat kind of person you are.
Are you having a hard time getting new\nsurvey items in the Survey Radar?\c\nIf you want more survey items, answer\nquestionnaires in the headquarters.
If you are an S-rank statistician, you\nmust have answered all the\r\nquestionnaires.\c\nWhat you want to know is\nwhat everybody wants to know.\c\nPlease volunteer to answer\nquestionnaires.
Good work today,\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nWe have more statisticians, and\nthis place has become quite lively.\c\nThe way things are going,\nwe can collect more survey data.
The more I conduct surveys,\nthe more fun it will be.\c\nI'm determined to pass by more people!\c\nIt's way more fun to conduct surveys\nwith people than doing them by myself.
By any chance, are you having trouble?\c\nIf it's difficult to pass by many people,\nI recommend you try a timed survey.\c\nIt takes time, but if you pass by just\none person, you can complete the\r\nrequest.
I'll give you a hint.\c\nIf you go to a place full of people,\nI recommend a head-count survey.\c\nYou can collect survey data really fast,\nso you can complete the request\r\nin a short time.
Good work today,\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nYou've become the top statistician\ninstantly.\c\nI should learn a lot from you\nand work hard!
When I answered a questionnaire earlier,\nI got a questionnaire sheet.\c\nMaybe I will answer all the\nquestionnaires...
After the questionnaire, the next step is\nconducting a survey.\c\nSet the request you want to survey\non the Survey Radar...\r\nAnd let's go!
New statisticians are not\nanswering questionnaires.\c\nIf they answered questionnaires,\nthey could conduct more surveys...\r\nWhat a shame!
Hello, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI've also started teaching novice\nstatisticians how to conduct surveys.
What is the popular movie now?\n[VAR 0100(0001)], do you have any idea?
What is the popular game now?\n[VAR 0100(0001)], do you have any idea?
What is the popular...\nOh, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nI knew it.\nI have to take a survey by myself...\c\nAh, it is a pain in the neck...
The survey requests from the leader\nare hard. Don't you agree?\c\nBesides, the number of more difficult\nsurveys are increasing...
Hello! Good work today, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nHave you finished all the\nsurvey requests from the leader?\c\nI heard if you finish all the requests,\nyou can get something good!
Oh! [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI'm honored to see you!\c\nOh, wow!\n[VAR 0100(0001)] spoke to me!
When you're happy,\nwhat do you say?\c\nI say “Awesome!"\nCould you teach me a new phrase?
Tell me something you just\nblurt out when you're happy!
Awesome!
OK, then. See you next time.\c\nWhen you're happy, you have\nto express that joy, right?
What a wonderful phrase!\c\nI registered it so I can\ninput it quickly in my\r\nTag Log comments!

Aww. You are the best!\nPlease come back tomorrow, too!

If you catch a Pokémon that's\n[VAR 0103(0000)] type, please show it to me!\r\nI'll give you a little something.
The Pokémon you chose is not the one\nI requested.\c\nWhat I want to paint is a Pokémon that's\n[VAR 0103(0000)] type!
Oh!\nThe shape of this Egg...\c\nSuperb! It gives me chills!\nIt's electrifying! It makes me tremble!\c\nAlas, even I cannot tell what type\nan Egg is!

People who work in this building have\nPokémon battles, not opinion battles.\c\nYou appear to be strong, but if you go\nupstairs, please be extra careful.\c
Oh, yes! If you'd like, you should\nhave your Pokémon hold this!\c
That's the Exp. Share!\c\nA Pokémon holding an Exp. Share gets\nsome of the Exp. Points from every\r\nbattle, even if it's not involved.\c\nIt may be useful for\nraising weak Pokémon!\c
I am a janitorial man. ♪\nI make everything spick and span. ♪\c
Welcome!\c\nIf you use the elevator, please use the\nbuttons on the door or next to the door.
Every morning, my Pokémon wakes me\nwith Uproar, so I always look like\r\na wreck.\c\nBut I appreciate its good intentions.\nI'll work my hardest to provide for it\r\ntoday, as always.
That thing you have is a Pokédex,\nisn't it?\c\nWow! Coooooool! You collect Pokémon!\nOK! I'll help you.\c\nWhich Pokémon did you choose at the\nbeginning of your journey?
You have Snivy! Then I will give you this!\c\nWhen you have your Pokémon hold it, it\ncan raise the power of Grass-type moves!\c
You have Oshawott! Then I will give\nyou this!\c\nWhen you have your Pokémon hold it, it\ncan raise the power of Water-type moves!\c
You have Tepig! Then I will give you this!\c\nWhen you have your Pokémon hold it, it\ncan raise the power of Fire-type moves!\c
A lot of items have effects when Pokémon\nhold them, so be on the lookout for\r\nthese items!\c\nWell, work hard to fill up your Pokédex!\nGood luck!
Snivy
Oshawott
Tepig

Do you have Snivy?
Do you have Oshawott?
Do you have Tepig?
Then, what is the Pokémon you chose\nat the beginning of your journey?
If you want to tell me, please speak\nto me!
I'm from the Castelia Harlequin Hunt!\c\nYou found the Battle Company\nHarlequin! All riiight!
Battle Company develops many\ndifferent items for Pokémon and Trainers!
This is Battle Company.\nResearch and Development of Items!
Burgh's signature is scrawled in the\ncorner of the painting.

I am in charge of development!\c\nI'm going to give you this, because you\ncame here for a company tour!\c
If a Pokémon holds a Scope Lens, it has\na better chance to make a critical hit!
Oh! A company tour?\nAnyway, let's have a battle!\c
What power! I'm moved,\nso I'll give you this present!
A Quick Ball makes it easier to catch a\nPokémon if you use it at the very\r\nbeginning of a battle.
Did you come for Pokémon practice?\nI'll be happy to help you out!\c
With skills like that,\nyou can get the most out of these!
A Timer Ball makes it easier to catch\na Pokémon you've been battling\r\nfor a long time!

Oh! You are the Pokémon Trainer\nI met at the entrance!\c\nYou've come this far. That means\nyou must be quite strong.\c\nAre you prepared to face the strongest\nperson in this building?\c\nThen, the time has come to challenge\nmy grandson, the company president!\c
I'll show you just how much\nthis Battle Company has researched\r\nPokémon and Trainers!\c
I lost...\c\nBecause you were strong,\nand I was weak.\c\nWe must do even more research\nfor Pokémon and for Trainers!
Thinking that when you win\nit's because of your Pokémon\r\nand that when you lose\r\nit's because of yourself\r\nmight make you stronger...\c\nBut enjoying yourself\nis much, much more important!
If you want to make a weak\nPokémon stronger, you should\r\nuse that Exp. Share.\c\nAny Pokémon that holds it receives\nExp. Points, even when it doesn't\r\nparticipate in battle!
My dream as president is to\nrelease a device that lets\r\npeople talk to Pokémon!

I have 10!\nI'm ahead of you!
I have 30!\nYou've collected many,\r\nbut I'm not going to lose!
I have 50!\c\nDid you know? If you collect\n50 Medals, something good happens.
Whoa! You reached the goal, too?\c\nMe?\c\nI have 100!\nHeh heh!
Amazing!\nYou've collected that many?\c\nYou have more than me!\c\nI've been having trouble\ngetting more since I collected 100...
If anyone can collect every\nMedal, it's you!\c\nI don't know how many\nthere are in all, but...\c\nMe? I only have 150...\c\nI'll do my best!
Wow!\c\nYou collected every Medal?!\nA-amazing! That's too incredible!\c\nI finally collected 200!\c\nI'll use you as an inspiration,\nand I'll do my best to get every one!
The maniacs for items are sure odd!\c\nThey'll buy ordinary items\nfor much more than normal!\c\nIf you hold on to items, even ones\nyou have no use for, you might be able to\r\nsell them to a maniac!

Hello!\nI am the Game Director.\c\nAh! You are working on your Pokédex!\nIf you fill it up a lot, please let me see!
Hello!\nI am the Game Director.\c\nOh! You've caught every kind of\nPokémon in Unova!\c\nIt's truly amazing!\nNow, we'll give you an award!!\c
I will send this award certificate\nto your house!
Hello!\nI am the Game Director.\c\nOh?\c\nBy any chance, did you...\nobtain all the Pokémon and\r\ncomplete your Pokédex?\c\nGreat.\c\nI am very happy\nthat you made great efforts\r\nto obtain so many Pokémon.\c\nPlease, please, please\nallow me to present you with this award!\c
The Pokédex.\nHow did you obtain so many Pokémon?\c\nObviously, you caught some by yourself,\nbut you can't complete the Pokédex\r\nby just catching them, right?\c\nYou probably traded Pokémon\nwith your friends and people\r\nall over the world to complete it...\c\nIf that's the case, the Pokédex is\nnot only a wealth of Pokémon information\r\nbut also a compilation of\r\nyour communication with others.
I will send this award certificate\nto your house, too!
A game is something\nto think about, program,\r\nand, at the end, hope for!\c\nWork! Work!\nWork! Please work!
I am the Graphic Designer.\c\nTo draw something I've never seen,\nI need to observe a lot of objects.\c\nNot only do I have to look at them,\nbut also I need to analyze them\r\nand truly absorb them.
A tip for getting strong\nin Pokémon battles...\c\nLet me see.\nI guess the most important thing is...\r\nhaving a lot of battles!\c\nDo you want to battle?
Well, let's begin!\c
OK. I hope we can battle next time.
Oh! You've become strong! I can tell.\nDo you want to have a battle with me?
Well, let's begin!\c
You think about battles very thoroughly.\c\nI lost, but I learned a lot from you.\nBesides, it was fun!\c\nCome back again tomorrow.
No?\c\nI've been raising Pokémon, thinking about\ntheir Abilities and just the right\r\ncombination of held items.\c\nWhat a pity...
I'm Snorlax.\c\nNo, no. I'm the Planner!\c\nI don't mean to butt in, but the\nitem Leftovers is important, isn't it?\c\nIt's pretty useful in battle.\nDo you want to battle and test it?
I like to win using my favorite Pokémon!\c
Awww! What great Pokémon!\c\nThe great number of steps seems to have\nincreased their trust in you...\c\nI hope we can battle again tomorrow.
No?! Really?\nMy Pokémon are pretty, though...
I'm the Sound Designer. I just woke up.\nI wonder what kind of music people like.
Hello!\nThis is GAME FREAK.
Now, er, I'm, er...\c\nI'm thinking, er, a new plan of, er...\c\n...Of a game.

My friend worries about everyone's\nhealth when they set off on journeys,\r\nso he always nicknames Pokémon\r\nhe trades “Gesundheit."\c\nI wonder how he's doing?

I want Pokémon to be\nin the new office...\c\nBut I can't say such a thing\nin front of my girlfriend.
Even before Poké Balls were created,\npeople and Pokémon were good friends.\r\nI wonder if this relationship will last\r\nin the future, too.
Missing Pokémon...\c\nEven if Team Plasma is responsible,\nwe don't know where they are.
I learned some Pokémon want to\nbe with Trainers...\c\nOf course, some Pokémon prefer\nto live wild.\c\nFor your information, I heard\nPokémon who have learned a hidden move\r\nmay come back, even if you try to\r\nrelease them.
My Pokémon...\nWhere did it go...?
My Pokémon!\nScraggy came back!\c\nI don't know if it was held captive\nby Team Plasma...\r\nor it was lost and came back by itself...\c\nBut anyway, I'm happy!

The number of Trainers on the\nRoyal Unova today is [VAR 0200(0003)].\r\nAnd you've won against [VAR 0200(0004)].\c\nThe ship is nearing the port.\nWould you like to get off the ship?
The number of Trainers on the\nRoyal Unova today is [VAR 0200(0003)].\c\nThe ship is nearing the port.\nWould you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship!\nI would like to give you advice 'cause\r\nyou need help finding Trainers!\c\nDo you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long\nstories, and they just keep talking\r\nuntil they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation\ndeck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with\nblue doors for someone to battle,\r\nyou’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the\ncabins with blue doors today is [VAR 0200(0002)].
It's running on the ocean!\nWhat a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to\nthe observation deck or battle some\r\nTrainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves,\nbut it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing\nthe scenery from the deck...\r\nThis ship is the best!
I've been wondering which cabin to enter\nthis whole time!
I came here from Johto for business,\nbut everything is dynamic here.
Oh! Nice timing!\nI wanted to talk to someone!\c\nI'm here from Johto\non a business trip!\c\nDon't you feel like people here are\na little cold? A little too suave, maybe?\c\nThat's why I get nervous and have a\nhard time making friends.\c\nI mean, even today, it's my day off,\nand I'm here riding a ship all alone!\c\nThat's it!\c\nTell me how people make\nfriends here in Unova!\r\nPlease! Come on!\c\nYou're busy?\nCouldn't you do something? Please!\c\n...\c\nAh, it's so nice to have a nice\nlong conversation. Thanks!\c
Oh! A whistle is blowing!\c\nSorry to bother you when you're busy!\nI hope you find some Trainers!\c\nI'll find some friends here\nby doing what you said!
Even on their days off, corporate\nwarriors are ready for battle! Let's go!\c
No matter how many times we battle,\nI can't compete with you...\c\nI'll just relax and enjoy\nmy boat ride!
You see, when going to a town on the\ncoast, I always travel by cruise ship.\c\nYou can take another look at places\nthat you've walked and get a new\r\nperspective on them from the sea.
When I'm relaxing like this,\nI often remember the Pokémon\r\nI've raised up until this point.\c\nThere were a few clumsy ones,\nbut they were all the best\r\ngroup of Pokémon you could want!
I've been traveling all over\nbecause I wanted to prove\r\nPokémon from the same place as me\r\ncan make it anywhere in the world!\c\nI won't lose to you either!\c
Trainers like you are hanging\nout all over the world!\c\nThinking about that gets\nme really pumped up!
I hear there are people on this ship\nfrom many places, like Kanto, Johto,\r\nand Sinnoh...\c\nNot only can you see pretty scenery\nfrom the ship, it looks like you can\r\nsee some unusual Pokémon!
I was on the deck with my arms\nspread out and feeling like\r\nI was a Pokémon.\c\nThen the ship suddenly shook,\nand I thought I was going to fall!\c\nSigh... I wish I had someone to save\nme right away at times like that.
Ta daaah! Good guess!\nGet ready for battle. Here I come!\c
I've been waiting\nfor a Trainer to challenge me!\r\nI was really sick of waiting!\c\nThanks for talking to me!
Hey! Doesn't this ship\nget you all excited?!\c\nI went completely wild while\nI was all wound up like this...\c\nThen they locked me up in this room...\c\nI won't cause any more trouble!\nLet me out of this room!
Pickin' a fight with me, huh?\nHeh! You don't know what\r\nyou're getting yourself into!\c\nHuh? What? Where are my Poké Balls?\nOh! I left them at home!
I feel sick...\nBut I'm a Trainer!\c\nI'm not going to lose to seasickness!\nLet's battle!\c
Urrg!\c\nSorry!\nLeave me alone for a minute...
Know what? I love this ship!\nI mean, it's royal!
Hey, get a load of this!\nEveryone's so mean!\c\nThey're calling me selfish\nand saying I blabber too much!\c\nEven though I'm the quiet and kind\nand cute girl that everyone adores!\c\nChanging the subject,\nwhat kind of Pokémon do you like?\c\nOh... Never mind. More importantly,\nisn't this outfit cute?\c\nI really like this brand...\c\n...\n...\c\nHow rude!\nHow dare you say I talk too much!\c
Oh! A whistle!\c\nI just talked a little, and\nnow it's already this late!
So, I recently moved here to Unova!\c\nHey, I've got some Pokémon you\ndon't usually see around here!\r\nLet's have a battle!\c
Aren't my Pokémon cute?\c\nI want to catch lots of\nPokémon here, too!
You want to battle?\c\nOh for pity's sake, this is why Trainers\nare just a bunch of uncouth brutes...\c\nDo something other than\nbattle for a change.\c\nHow about you enjoy this\nelegant moment quietly?
I hear the Royal Unova\nhas been sailing around Castelia City\r\nsince before I was born!
Nice!\c\nI was bored, because Mommy and Daddy\nare on the deck! Let's battle!\c
I have to wonder about parents\nwho would leave their child to\r\ngo talk about love on the deck!
The wind's strong today,\nso I'm relaxing in my room.\c\nI'll have this lovely room\nall to myself until we return to port! ♪
The first whistle means\n“Hello, nice to meet you!"\c\nThe second whistle means\n“The ocean's lovely today!"\c\nThe third and fourth whistles mean\n“Are you enjoying your sea voyage?"\c\nThe fifth whistle means\n“Thanks, and see you again!"\c\nIsn't it a nice feeling to think\nthe ship talks like this?
You! You came to pick up\ncute little me?\c\nTee hee hee! I'll be your opponent\nin an amazing Pokémon battle!\c
That's right... You're going to\ntake Pokémon with you, not me!
From your standpoint,\nI'm a Trainer from beyond the sea,\r\nand from my standpoint,\r\nyou're a Trainer from beyond the sea!
Oh! Welcome. Please sit down.\nI'll pour you some tea.\c\nPlease, don't be bashful!\nA Gentleman must entertain\r\nguests who are kind enough\r\nto visit his room.\c\nCome now. Forget about battles\nfor one moment.\c\nWould you like tea or coffee?\nDoesn't it have a lovely fragrance?\c\n...\c\nThat was a lot of fun.\nCome again!\c
That was a lot of fun.\c\nIf you'd like to relax again sometime,\nplease come again!
Oh! Welcome. Please sit down.\nI'll pour you some tea...\c\nKidding! I'm a Trainer!\nI'll entertain you with Pokémon!\c
Nothing like a tea break after\nan intense Pokémon battle!\c\nWould you like to join me for a cup?\nAh... Out of tea...
Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers?\nSorry, I don't know where to find them.\c\nBut the crew may know where they are.
As I left my body to the\nswaying of the sea,\r\na rich poem sprung\r\nup from the depths of my soul.\c\nThe title is,\n“Everything's Blue!"\c\nLet me read it to you!\c\nOh, ocean! You're blue!\nSky! You're blue, too!\r\nI talk a blue streak!\r\nI'm afraid that in a blue moon,\r\nthat sunset will turn a baby blue!\r\nThat's it!\c\nMy next poem is,\n“Everything's Red!"\c\nOK! Here I go!\c\n...\c\nMmm! Isn't that a moving poem?\nHee hee! Feel free to cry!\c
You're looking for a Trainer?\nI'm sorry I didn't notice!\c\nI was sure that you were\nwandering around looking\r\nfor a wonderful poem!
Hee hee! Looking for a Trainer?\nI'm an old woman, but do you mind?\c
Battling on the ocean\nsure has charm, doesn't it?
I hear there is a troublesome\nguy somewhere in the cabins\r\nwho just goes on and on.\c\nHe's called the Seviper guy because\nhe resembles a Pokémon.
Ho ho! You talked to me, didn't you?\c\nOnce I've sunk my fangs into you,\nI never let go!\c\nEveryone on this cruise ship\nlikens me to a Pokémon--\r\nI'm the Seviper guy!\c\nI mean, c'mon. I'm so lonely!\nI want to talk to young people!\c\nWell now, first of all, listen\nto me complain about work...\c\n...\c\n...Huh?\nWhat was I going to talk about again?\c
I don't care how many\ntimes the whistle blew--I'm lonely!\c\nDon't leave me!
I'm sorry! This room is being cleaned...\nOh my! You're a Trainer, aren't you?\c\nHee hee! Why don't we have\na quiet little Pokémon battle?\c
The fact I stopped working\nto battle is our secret, OK?
Today...\c\nAs for people, we have [VAR 0200(0000)] on the\nport side and [VAR 0200(0001)] on the starboard side.
Today...\c\nThe number of people on the starboard\nside is [VAR 0200(0001)], and...none on the port side.

A beautiful melody makes people happy.\nA sad melody makes people sorrowful...\r\nThat's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of\na long-ago melody from the fringes of my\r\nsepia-toned memories.\c\nIt was a song my mother loved...\nIt makes me feel so nostalgic.\c\nWould you like to hear the melody?\c
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that\nplayed a melody and danced so lightly\r\nthat it filled people's hearts with joy.\c\nThen sorrow darkened the entire world,\nand the Pokémon's melody was lost...\c\nAt the same time, somewhere,\nsome red shoes were lost...\c
When you came through the door,\nI remembered the melody!\c\nAnd the Pokémon that had forgotten how\nto dance began to step lightly once more!\c\nYou are the inspiration.\nYou are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song.\c\nAria Forme will become Pirouette Forme,\nand vice versa.
[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered the\nRelic Song it had forgotten!\c
                                            
                              
                             
                     
                                                                                      
This is your first visit to this café.\nAm I correct?\c\nPlease...\c
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here.\nEnjoy...
I've been letting my tired mind relax\nin this café this whole time...
Listen to him playing guitar...\nI went back to the home I'd left behind,\r\nand my mother cried tears of joy...\r\nThat's mothers for you.
You can't change your family,\nbut you can change how you\r\ninteract with one another.\c\nStill, that said...
Thanks to you and Meloetta,\nmemories of my birthplace...\r\nmemories of when I was little...\r\nmemories of singing together after\r\nwe finished gathering Berries...\r\nAll these memories came flooding back.\c
The Funfest Mission\n“[VAR 0140(0000)]"\r\nhas been added to the Entralink.
I'm going to have fun gathering Berries\nwith the people living in the countryside\r\nand the Pokémon I've met here in\r\nCastelia City!\c\nOf course, I'll be humming\nMeloetta's tune while I gather them!

Oh! That does happen sometimes!\c\nI've just been calling it a\ncritical capture!\c\nThe more Pokémon you catch,\nthe more likely that phenomenon is!\c\nApparently, when the Poké Ball\nonly rocks once, it's easier\r\nto catch a Pokémon.

Hi there, Trainer!\nMy name is Fennel.\c\nI'm researching\nPokémon Trainers!\c
The [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] is a vital\npart of that research!\c\nLet me explain the system\nfor collecting Trainers' save files.\c
[VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync [VAR FF00(0000)]is a system that retrieves\nthe memories of sleeping Pokémon!\c\nThat's right! We can collect save files of\nTrainers from all over the world!\c
What's more, we learned that if you use\n[VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] to make a Pokémon sleep,\r\nit will have dreams.\c\nThen, when you wake up that Pokémon,\nits dream becomes the reality in a\r\nspace called the [VAR FF00(0001)]Entralink [VAR FF00(0000)]in the middle\r\nof the Unova region.\c\nAmazing, right?!\nIf you like, please send your save file.\c\nMy assistant can explain the details,\nso if you're interested,\r\nplease talk to her.
Fennel: [VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] is amazing, right?!\nIf you like, please send your save file.\c\nMy assistant can explain the details,\nso if you're interested,\r\nplease talk to her.
Fennel: Oh, thank you!\c\nYou also sent your save file. I saw it\nwhile I was researching Trainers!\c\n[VAR FF00(0002)]Game Sync[VAR FF00(0000)] is amazing, right?
Are you a Trainer?\c\nDo you use the PC at Pokémon Centers?\c\nI am Amanita. I maintain the Box system.\c
Oh!\nYou have a Pal Pad, I see!\c\nYou can register your friends in your\nPal Pad.\c\nAfter you register, you can link with\nthose friends over Nintendo Wi-Fi\r\nConnection to do all kinds of fun things!\c\nYou can trade Pokémon, challenge\nyour friends to a battle, and so on.\c\nLet me give you a quick how-to on\nregistering your friends.\c\nYou can either input your friend's code\ndirectly by using your Pal Pad...\c\nOr you can use the IR Connection\nfeature of the C-Gear.\c\nThen, you can register your friend!\c
Amanita: Is there something you'd like\nto ask me?
Box
Battle Box
Pal Pad
Cancel
You can store up to 30 Pokémon\nyou caught in one Box.\c\nAt first, there are only eight Boxes,\nbut as you store more Pokémon,\r\nthe number of Boxes increases!
In the Battle Box, you can register one\nto six Pokémon that you often use\r\nin battles.\c\nWhen you battle using Infrared\nConnection, you can also battle with\r\nthe Pokémon in the Battle Box!\c\nIt's convenient because you don't\nhave to move Pokémon around!
In order to register your friend\nin your Pal Pad...\c\nYou can either input your friend's code\ndirectly by using your Pal Pad in the\r\nKey Item case...\c\nOr you can use the IR Connection\nfeature of the C-Gear.\c\nThen, you can register your friend!
Catch a lot of Pokémon,\nand use the Boxes a lot!
Oh! How are the Boxes working?\c\nHey, that's right!\nI have a bunch of Eevee!\r\nWould you take one for me?
This is an Eevee I received from\nmy friend in the Kanto region!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nan Eevee!
Would you like to give a\nnickname to this Eevee?
Oh! Your party is full!\c\nThe PC Boxes were designed for\nsituations just like this!
How disappointing.\c\nWell, if you change your mind,\nplease come talk to me again!
Eevee is an amazing Pokémon\nthat has many potential evolutions!
I'm working as Fennel's assistant.\c

I'm Emmet.\c\nI'm a Subway Boss.\c\nI love Double Battles!\c\nAnd I love the combination\nof two Pokémon!
Ingo: Having a battle in a place like this\nis a little irregular, but this must've\r\nhappened for a reason.\c\nBattling in a different place will let me\nsee different scenery, and I might learn\r\nsomething, too.\c\nNow, Emmet, if you have something\nto add, please!\c
Emmet: Follow the rules and drive safely!\c\nWe're headed for victory!\nAll aboard!\c
Ingo: Bravo!\c\nThe combination of you and your\nPokémon is truly fantastic!\c
Emmet: I'm Emmet.\c\nWhile I may have lost to you...\c\nI had a good time!\nLet's play again sometime!\c
Ingo: Yes! Definitely! Next time,\nplease ride the subway\r\nand battle with us there!\c\nWell then, we're off! All aboard!\c

Welcome to the main stage!\c\nMy beloved Pokémon\nand your Pokémon shall compete!\c\nWe're going to see whose\nstar shines brightest!\c
Well...\c\nNow, you...you're an even more wonderful\nTrainer than I expected.\c\nYour sweet fighting style\nswept me off my feet!\r\nTake this!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nBolt Badge from Elesa!\c
If you have four Badges, including this\nBolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50,\r\nincluding traded Pokémon, will obey you.\c\nAlso, here's this move I like.\nFeel free to use it, um, if you want to.\c
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with\na different Pokémon after attacking.\c\nOf course, if you don't have another\nPokémon in your party, you can't switch.
I want my relationship with my Pokémon\nto be less like sun and moon\r\nand more like two blazing suns!\c\nThere'd be no limit to how bright\nwe could shine!
What my Pokémon want to do\nand what I want to do...\r\nWhen they are the same...\c\nWe have more than twice\nthe energy to shine!
Wait!\c\nPlease walk with us.\c
A shining example of a Trainer...\c\nSince that's what you are, you should\nbe able to collect all the Gym Badges\r\nand reach the Pokémon League!\c\nThen, you and your Pokémon\nwill shine even brighter!
Elesa: A model always has to make\nother people's dreams a reality\r\nwithout losing sight of herself.\c\nIt's similar for Trainers and Pokémon.\nTrainers have to give everything they\r\nhave to make their Pokémon feel like\r\nthey can win, no matter the situation.\c\nWhen I realized that, modeling\nbecame that much more fun.
Welcome to the Nimbasa Gym!\c\nA stylish Pokémon battle and\nfashion show created by Pokémon\r\nand Trainers is starting now!\c
Isn't this Gym beautiful when it's lit up?\c\nThe Pokémon also look beautiful\nin this lighting!
You and your Pokémon\nsparkle and shine!
Are you beautiful as a Trainer?\nSurprise me!\c
Ms. Elesa is strong and beautiful...\c\nDon't make the mistake of thinking\nshe's the same as us.
Beauty isn't just about looks.\c\nStrength is a part of beauty,\nboth for you and for Elesa.
The show is coming to its finale.\nNow, I'll see if you are worthy\r\nto stand on the same stage as Elesa!\c
Being able to see a match between\na challenger and Elesa this close...\c\nThat makes even us gleam with joy!
That was a beautiful Pokémon battle\nyou and Elesa had!\c\nI was captivated by it!\nWhat an absolutely marvelous show!
What do you think? Surprised, right?\c\nThis Gym is, speaking frankly, a glittering\nfashion show and a dazzling stage!\c\nWell, for now, I'll give you this!\c
In this Pokémon Gym, we'll have you\nproceed by defeating the Trainers waiting\r\non the catwalk!\c\nBy the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't\ndo well against Ground-type moves...\c\nOh!\c\nBut Ground-type moves don't work\nagainst a Pokémon called Emolga,\r\nso please be careful!
Elesa uses sparkling, bright\nElectric-type attacks!\c\nBut the combination of you and your\nPokémon shone even brighter!\c\nWhy, you're...you're...\na supermodel!\c\nWell, no. You're just a really good\nTrainer with great Pokémon!

The challenge was interrupted.
The selection was canceled.
Constant battles make me nervous.\nI'm taking a little rest here.
I'm going to save up Battle Points and\nget some items for my Pokémon to hold.
For each seven-win streak, the Trainers\nand Pokémon who challenge you become\r\nprogressively tougher.
I've decided to use only cute Pokémon!\c\nDo you have any unique thing you're\nparticular about?
OK! I'm all prepared!\nAll aboard for a battle journey!
Phew...I'm worn out.\c\nThese Trainers are tough. I wonder\nhow far I'll get with my skills.
Have you heard of the Subway Bosses?\c\nThey appear only to strong Trainers,\nand they challenge them to battles.\c\nThey are the Battle Subway's bosses.
That last battle was tough...\c\nI should've traded in my BP for a\nbetter item.
If you have wooon, the trip goes ooon!\nRelying on Pokémon, this vagabooond!
About time to take it to the next level.\nGive it your best shot, too!
The Trainers here are really tough\nfrom the very start.
My 42nd straight win...\nNot too shabby, eh?
Can't believe I won 84 straight...\nIs this a dream or a hallucination?
You've got a 14-win streak!\nPretty good! Not bad!
I hear the Super Train is endless!\c\nIn other words, if you keep winning, you\ncan keep going, on and on to wherever!
I can go a lot further!\nI can win a lot more!
The eyes of the Trainers here are very\nserious, or maybe you could say glinting.
Is this the best this officer can do...?\c\nThe light from the passing trains seems\nway too bright.
The Subway Boss was a suspicious,\nstrange fellow.\c\nI still don't believe he was giving it\nhis all.
Challenging people is also part of my\npolice training.
I can legally go as wild as I want!\nThis place! It's paradise, isn't it?
My journey has just started!\nNeither of us can afford to lose!
Being alone on the station's platform\nsomehow makes me feel a little sad.\c\nPeople leave on their journeys here, and\nit reminds me of those memories.
The Subway Boss was a piece of cake!\c\nMaybe I should cut loose on the\nSuper Train next time!
The Trainers sure have become stronger.\nI'm feeling a little uneasy...
It looks like my Pokémon skill has\nreached its peak power.\c\nI couldn't let go of my dreams...\nI'll hang them on you, stranger,\r\nyoung Trainer.\c\nAnd this is proof.\nPlease accept this, youngster...\c
I'm going to return to my home and\nquietly cheer myself up with art!
Oh ho ho ho...\c\nI've already done better than I did\nduring my last challenge!
Battle between two excellent Trainers is\nvery artistic.
For being called a Subway Boss,\nthat Trainer sure wasn't as strong\r\nas “Boss" suggests.\c\nIt was almost as if...\c\nAs if they are simply gauging\nhow strong we really are.
Well then!\c\nIt's about time to get on\nthe train!
Now just wait a minute, little Pokémon!\nI'll let you battle lots and lots soon!
Urk!\c\nI got motion sickness on the train...
You beat our boss, right?\nNot half bad, hey!\c\nAnd now, super Trainer, you've\nearned the qualification to take on the\r\nSuper Train!\c\nThe Trainers on the Super Train are\nreally tough.\c\nIf you want to know the essence of the\nBattle Subway, you should give it a try!
I'd rather have an exciting battle than\nslowly drive the train.
Where did you come from?\nAnd where are you going?
We Depot Agents are the protectors of\npeace and order in the station.\c\nWe are verrry opposed to littering on\nthe platform, shouting or playing\r\ninstruments, loitering, or any activities\r\nthat bother other people!
Just like how a machine needs fine-tuning,\nPokémon need maintenance, too.\c\nIt's a necessity.\c\nFor example, rethinking the moves that a\nPokémon knows.
No clumsy gimmicks...\nNo unnecessary items...\c\nThe only thing you can rely on is the\nstrength of you and your Pokémon.\c\nThis place is wonderful, isn't it?
Over 100 straight victories...\c\nIf this is all due to your strength,\nyou're even a match for the Champion.
The strength of the Trainers on\nthe Super Train is beyond imagination!
I had a taste of it...\nThe rush of battle...\c\nI shouldn't...\nIt's too wild...\c\nBut at this rate, I'm going to\nend up on the path of battlers...
Howdy! I'm a genius Pilot!\nUnova's finest!\c\nAnd I'm comin' in first here, too!
I've seen elite Trainers like me\nall over the place, but...\c\nSeems like the battles will be tough\nfrom here on.
Even for an elite Trainer such as myself,\nit's starting to get hard.
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
I've a-done it--77 straight wins!\nThat number has a lucky sound!
We've defeated over 300 Trainers...
My my, what a weak-looking Trainer...\c\nI think I would just get bored if I\nbattled you...\c\nI'll give you this, so just get a little\ntougher, OK?\c
I'm only interested in strong\nopponents...\c\nIf you get tougher, I wouldn't\nmind battling you.
Not many people left on the platform...\c\nGuess that shows how hard it is\nto keep winning on the Battle Subway.
...\c\nHuh? What? What do you want?\c\nI'm busy planning my tactics for my\nnext battle.\c\nI don't mean to be rude, but I really\nneed to concentrate. Would you mind\r\nnot talking to me right now?
Ninety-one straight victories is nothing\nmore than a natural result for me.\c\nMy glorious record will just keep\ngoing up!
You...\nYou have the same eyes as me.\c\nYou love battling so much...\nNo, it's not just that...\c\nBattling is your reason for living.\nYou and I are the same type, aren't we?\c\nSo...I'll give you this.\c
You're continuing your battle, right?\c\nThat's because we are that type of\nperson, aren't we...
I'm going to leave a rockin' record and\nturn into a big star!
Hey, how are you doing?\nI'm still going strong!
There's more to Pokémon than it seems.\c\nThe world of Pokémon battling really gets\ndeeper and deeper.
I found this when I was cleaning.\nYou can have it if you'd like.\c
Oh, no need to thank me!\nAfter all, I just found it in the trash.\c\nI don't understand it. Recently, many\nfolks have just been throwing away\r\nperfectly good things.
I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot\nof confidence in my abilities!
All right! Bring out your Poké Balls!\nNow is the time for a battle!
You like battles, too!
I can't believe a Veteran like me\nwould get into trouble like that.\c\nWhere in the world are the Trainers\nhere training?
How are you doing, Trainer?\nAre you starting to get tired yet?
Mumble, mumble, mumble...\c\nIn order to bring good fortune, I always\nthink about my family before a battle.
I've been watching you battle.\c\nNice technique and judgment... Not\nsurprising, after a win streak like yours.
Not many people around.\c\nBut each person who is still here has\nshown true strength.
Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler\nif they get careless.\c\nPokémon battling requires that you\nalways be on guard.
Just a little more to 50 straight wins!\nSuddenly, I'm all pumped up!
You have the face of someone who\nabsolutely loves Pokémon battling.\c\nEven now, you're still completely hooked\non battling. Amazing.\c\nHee hee...\nYou have a promising future!
You and I both have 91 straight wins!\c\nWhich of us will reach a 100-win\nstreak first?
Dawn and dusk behind my battles...\c\nThe rocking train softly rattles...\c\nHow many hours have now passed\nsince we left Nimbasa in the past?
This is the end of the line...\c\nThe trip sure ended quickly.\nI don't want to go home yet.
If you've made it this far, that means\nyou've won 14 in a row.\c\nWhat a fluke! Fourteen is how old I am!\c\nHa ha ha...
I'm going to let people know I'm still\nas active as ever!
It's the end of the line already...\c\nI guess that means my Pokémon\nbattle journey is over for now.
Phew...\c\nThis long journey is hard on this\nold body.
Hmm. You've got 28 straight wins, huh?\c\nThis time, I want to keep going\nwith this momentum.
You also beat the Subway Boss, right?\nSomeday I want to battle you, too!
When my favorite Poké Ball begins\nto shake, I tremble with excitement!\c\nYou're no ordinary Trainer, are you?\nPerhaps you are the Champion somewhere?
Winning battles feels good, but I've\ntraveled quite far... I wonder if I can\r\nget back in time for work tomorrow...
I finally have a 49-battle win streak.\c\nIf I can do this well at work, I wonder\nif I can get promoted...
Both you and I have won more than\n100 straight battles!\c\nI may have too much time on my hands,\nbut so do you.\c\nTake this to commemorate our meeting of\ntwo similar people!\c
It's a really precious Berry, but I don't\nknow how to use it other than to eat it\r\nas a snack...

Hello! How do you do?\c\nI'm the owner of this theater.\nPleasure to meet you!\c
Ooh! I must say that you seem like\na phenomenal Trainer!\c\nWhat do we do here? We use Props to make\nyour Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!\c\nDo you want to join in and play Dress Up?\nTo get you started, here's a Prop Case!\c
This Prop Case lets you store Props for\ndecorating your Pokémon!\c\nFirst off, you need to pick a Pokémon!\c
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't\nplay Dress Up. Please choose a\r\ndifferent Pokémon next time.\c
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing\nyour Pokémon's innate charm by choosing\r\nnot to decorate it!\c\nHonestly, though, I think using Props\nwould be better received in this musical.\c
Now, now. Don't be like that.\nPlease reconsider and select a Pokémon!\c
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!\c
Wow! You have the talent! You did a\nfantastic job coordinating everything!\r\nUtterly charming!\c
If you have a Pokémon that can play\nDress Up, you can participate in the\r\nPokémon Musical!\c\nWould you please join us?\nThe receptionist can explain everything.\c\nLet us say a brief farewell!\nI eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!\c
       
We really want you to participate in\nthe musical!\c\nI apologize in advance if any of our\nProps don't suit some kinds of Pokémon.\c\nPokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait!\c\nYou participated in a musical\nwith your friends, right?\c\nI felt like you opened up new possibilities\nfor musicals!\c\nThat's why I feel impelled to give you\nthis present! Please accept it!\c
I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!
Your continued participation makes me\na happy owner!\c\nYou're attracting a lot of attention as\nan up-and-coming stylist.\c\nOf course, I'm watching you closely,\nas well.\c\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy appreciation.\c
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you\non stage again!\c\n...Actually, it feels like I've said this\nline before.\c\nWell, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation\nmakes me a happy owner.\c\nApparently, some audience members have\nbeen calling you a top stylist as of late!\c\nBest of all... How impressive am I for\nrecognizing your talent?\c\nPlease accept this as a token of\nmy gratitude!\c
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday!\nI've got this festive Prop to give you!\c\nIt's a cake from me, the owner!\c\nOf course, this is a Prop, so you should\nattach it to your Pokémon and not eat it.\c\nBy the way, even if today isn't your\nbirthday, I won't take it back!\c\nWhy?\nBecause I'm the owner!\c
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous\nthan ever before, so I'm researching the\r\nstyles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up\nthere today!\c\nOverall, totally [VAR 0123(0000)]!\c\nThe [VAR 0123(0001)] Prop\nwas a great accent.\c\nI noticed that your [VAR 0123(0002)]\nfactor was a bit subdued today.\c\nOK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the\nshow you're performing in is im-por-tant!\c\nIf it's a good match, you can win the\nhearts of the audience!\r\nYou'll be sure to attract attention.\c\nIf you're going to get on stage,\nit's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image:\ncool, cute, elegant, or quirky.\c\nBefore you play Dress Up, take a moment\nto think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're\nrather rich.\c\nWhen you say rich people, you think\nmusical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have\nplayed Dress Up with their Pokémon\r\nwith such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful!\nI'm always watching them.\c\nI hope you can keep entertaining us with\nyour performances.
I always make sure to watch the\nshows you participate in!\c\nEven from the perspective of a rich\nman like me, the Pokémon Musical\r\nis impressive!\c\nIt's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from\nlast time!\c
You can hang Musical Photos from your\nprevious shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon,\nmy eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this\nMusical Theater.\c\nOne time, a Pokémon wandered up on\nstage and started imitating the actors.\c\nEverybody thought it was sensational!\nTa-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people\nwill become your fans and give you Props.\c\nI don't have any Props, so I'll give you\nthis instead!\c
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is\nboosted more and more if it's used\r\nevery turn.\c\nHaving a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep\nparticipating in the musical, and keep\r\nusing Echoed Voice!\c\nYou'll make more fans in the musical, and\nyou'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater\nProps + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance,\nbut I think you belong on the\r\nspectacular stage!
Hello! How do you do?\c\nI'm the owner of this theater.\nPleasure to meet you!\c
Ooh! I must say that you seem like\na phenomenal Trainer!\c\nWhat do we do here? We use Props to make\nyour Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!\c\nDo you want to join in and play Dress Up?\nTo get you started, here's a Prop Case!\c
Hmm... Have we met\nbefore?\r\nNever mind. I must be imagining things.\c\nI'm the owner of this theater.\nPleasure to meet you!\c
Whoa!\nYou have no ordinary aura.\c\nIt resembles that of a superstar\nwho attracts a lot of attention.\c\nBy the way, do you know\nwhat Dress Up is?\c
That makes it easy!\nHere's a Prop Case for you.\c
In Dress Up, we use Props to make\nyour Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!\c\nTo get you started, here's a Prop Case!\c
You know what? I'll give you this\nProp Case!\c\nIt contains all the Props our superstar\n[VAR 0100(0000)] used to have.\c
I hope you'll be the superstar of a\nnew generation!\c\nIt's time to play Dress Up!\c
Hmm...\c\nYour aura is definitely similar\nto that of the superstar who\r\nattracted a lot of attention.\c\nHere is a present for you!\c\nThese are the same Props that\n[VAR 0100(0000)] used to have.\c
I believe you'll find a good use\nfor these Props!\c\nI hope you'll enjoy the musical!
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\na set of Props!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\na [VAR 0109(0001)] and a set of Props!\c
Are you sure?\c\nPlease talk to me again if you want a set\nof Props that are the same as the\r\nones [VAR 0100(0000)] used!
Oh my!\c\nYou already have all the Props\nthe superstar used to have.\c\nI knew you were something!
There used to be a Trainer\nwho performed wonderful shows.\r\nI was a big fan back then.\c\nI wonder if we'll ever see\nanother superstar like that...
Oh, you seem a bit like [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI was a big fan a while ago.\c\nYou still lack a certain charisma\ncompared to [VAR 0100(0000)], though.
Oh, you are as wonderful an entertainer\nas [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI'm a big fan of you now!\nThank you for a wonderful show!
Oh, you!\nYou remind me of...\c
Mmm, that takes me back!
Would you like a set of Props that are\nthe same as the ones [VAR 0100(0000)] used?
You can receive this set of Props\nonly once. Do you want it?

In this musical, it's not an\noverstatement to say that [VAR 0100(0000)]'s\r\nPokémon was the lead role.\c
The Pokémon used Props to convey such\nabundant expression, just as if they\r\nwere actors!\c
Watching your Pokémon's sharp moves,\nI also felt [VAR 0123(0001)]!\c
Your Pokémon played its role very well.\c
It looked like your Pokémon was making an\neffort to live up to your expectations.\c\nI will support your Pokémon on the side!\c
It was not highly noticeable...\nBut I liked it! Keep it up!\c
Thank you very much for participating in\nthe musical today!\c\nPlease join another musical again!\nHave a great day!\c

Athletes who score points, and athletes\nwho support them...\c\nDetermining their different roles is the\nkey to building a team!
Football is a fun sport that is divided\ninto offense and defense.
His... Those eyes...\c\nIt looks like he's coming\nright at me!
The helmet and pads weigh\n15 to 18 pounds!
I've trained and built up my muscles\nby tackling Pokémon!\c\nNothing can move me!
OK! I will defend to the end with moves\nlike Protect and Detect!
My favorite moves?\c\n...Hmm.\nI'd say Tackle and Take Down.
Reading your opponent's attack and\ndeciding your next move...\c\nBoth Pokémon battles and football have\nthe same thrill!
The appeal of football?\nLet me see...\c\nFirst, just watch a game without thinking\nabout the rules!
I'll protect my team with my whole body\nto avoid our opponents' interference!
In football, the quarterback is the\nathlete who decides a strategy and\r\ncarries it out.\c\nHe's kind of like a Pokémon Trainer!
In football, you have to learn each and\nevery formation by heart!
The ball used in football is oval-shaped\nand hard to throw, isn't it?\c\nBut once you get the hang of it, you can\nthrow it perfectly!
I am a greeeeeat secret weapon!\c\nThe only problem is, I am so secret that\nI've never been in a game...
Yoo-hoo! Pass me the ball!
Bodies crashing into other bodies!\nGo, go, go!\c\nI am the owner. That’s what\nI like to see.

When I was a kid, I played catch with\nmy Pokémon!
It's not bad to grow up.\c\nBut it's bad to forget what it felt like\nto be a child.
I have baseball, and I have Pokémon...\nHow happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit\na ball.\c\nIf you don't do things, you won't fail...\nbut you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the\ntime! That is the only thing I can do.
What I brag about is my bat!

Everybody makes mistakes.\c\nBut goalkeepers cannot afford a mistake,\nbecause they cannot score goals to make\r\nup for it.\c\nIf one Pokémon on a team makes a\nmistake, however, the other Pokémon\r\nand their Trainer can cover for it!
If a Striker catches a teammate's eye,\nthey understand each other.\c\nA Pokémon and its Trainer are the same.\nDon't you agree?
Really strong Trainers thoroughly do\nwhatever they can do!
Soccer is beautiful and fun!\nPokémon are also beautiful and fun!
Soccer with Pokémon is Pokémon soccer.\nThe abbreviation is...Poker?\r\nNo, wait, that's a fireplace tool.\r\nHow about Poccer?
Throw a sound pass to a team member!\c\nAfter that, to receive a sound pass,\nyou'll need to move swiftly.

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Challenging the Gym, huh?\nNice! Keep getting stronger!\c\nLet me tell you, though,\nClay's tough!\c\nEven if all you have to use against\nGround types is Water-type Pokémon,\r\nyou might still be in for a rough fight!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You got a Gym Badge, too!\nI knew you could do it!\c\nYou know... My partners are the reason\nI was able to get that Badge.\c\nBut I'm sure there's more connecting\nus to each other than Poké Balls!\c\nIf that's all there is, the stolen\nPurrloin's feelings will never be\r\nwhat they were!\c
Clay: Oh, so you two squirts\nknow each other, huh?\c\nYa both ain't bad, so\nI wanna show ya somethin'.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\nI just remembered. Clay...\c\nWhy? What's the reason?\nWhy have you forgiven Team Plasma?\c
Clay: There's always room for folks\nto grow and change, ain't there?\c\nAnd, if ya only go after what ya think is\nright, ya might end up rejectin' all\r\nthoughts and opinions other than\r\nyer own. That's mighty dangerous.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmph...\nIs that one of those compromises\r\nadults are supposed to make?\c\nWhatever!\nI'm gonna fight Team Plasma!\c\nOh yeah, what were you wanting\nto show us?\c
Clay: Ya ever heard of the\nPokémon World Tournament?\c\nTrainers from all over the world\ngather on up to see who's toughest!\c\nWell then, I'll be waitin' for you at the\nsouth end of town!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: A tournament\nto decide who's strongest, huh?\c\nRight on!\nIt's time for some special training!\c
So how about this city's pride and joy,\nthe drawbridge?\c\nWe also call it the Charizard Bridge\ndue to its elegant form!
The Elite Four of the Pokémon League\nare extremely tough!\c\nI hear you can't battle them unless\nyou have eight Gym Badges!
When there's an item in your Bag\nyou want to switch,\r\njust press SELECT\r\nand give it a new niche! ♪\c\nDoesn't that jingle take you back?
A long time ago, Team Plasma\nstole my Pokémon...\c\nWell, they did give it back later!
Rokorroook!
I want to level up my dear Pokémon\nso they never have to feel\r\nthe sting of defeat!
Whoooa, dude! If a Pokémon uses the move\nSurf, it can catch a wave!
Even though I used to look\nat the Cold Storage every day...\c\nI've already forgotten\nwhat it looked like...
A Pokémon of thunder and\na Pokémon of wind were roaming\r\neverywhere and causing trouble!\c\nThen they were punished\nby a Pokémon of the soil.\c\nI like that story!
On the other side of the ocean...\nAnd all over the world, there sure\r\nare a lot of different Pokémon!
There are former members of\nTeam Plasma in there...\c\nI'm worried that they might\nbe up to no good again...
Bridges connect different lands.\c\nTrading and battling with Pokémon\ncan connect different people.\c\nI guess that means Pokémon\nare a kind of bridge as well!
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nI wanted to get the attention of a girl\nI like, so I learned a new style of\r\nPokémon battling.\c\nIts name... Rotation Battle!\nWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\nreally hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three\nPokémon at a time and battle!\c\nOne Pokémon takes the lead position,\nand the other two stand on each side.\c\nThe trick is, each turn you can change\ntheir positions...\c\nAnd that's a rough explanation\nof Rotation Battles.\c
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\nRotation Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\c\nI'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nI'm always at full throttle.\c
I hate to burst your bubble when you're\nall fired up, but...\c\nIn Rotation Battles, you need three or\nmore Pokémon to battle.

Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting\nschooled when I was planning to teach.\c\nStill, you have potential!\c\nYou have to understand your Pokémon\nto win in a Rotation Battle.\c\nIf you want more Rotation Battles,\ngo to the Pokémon World Tournament!

Phew...\nYou're really somethin'!\c\nLi'l whippersnapper Trainers\nwho pack a real punch keep\r\nshowin' up one after another.\c\nMrmph.\nHere! Take this!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the Quake Badge\nfrom Clay!\c
So this is yer fifth Badge, huh?\c\nIf that's so, Pokémon up to Lv. 60\nwill obey ya.\c\nHere!\nTake this, too!\c
I don't know how much potential ya got,\nbut if ya think ya can go, go wherever,\r\nand if ya think ya can do somethin',\r\nkeep doin' it.\c\nDo things how ya want!\nDecide yer own limits.
Well, I suppose...\nCome thisaway!\c
Clay: Mrrmph! You, huh?\nRemember what I done told ya?\c\nIf ya think ya can go, go wherever,\nand if ya think ya can do somethin',\r\nkeep doin' it.\c\nDo things how ya want!\nDecide yer own limits.
My Pokémon dig because they\nbelieve they're gonna find something,\r\nand they battle because they believe\r\nthey're gonna win!\c
Clay's awesome!\nHe can just tell if minerals will be there!\c\nGot it? Another way to say it is\nthat Clay will be wherever\r\nthere are oodles of ores!
The one you meet when you get on this\nconveyor is none other than me!\c
Have you used the elevator?\c\nIf you get on the elevator,\nyou can figure out where you\r\nhaven't been, right?
Just because you work hard doesn't\nmean you're gonna get what you want!\c\nBut if you don't work hard,\nthere are many things you can't do.\c\nLet me show you how tough\nmy hard work has made me!\c
Driftveil City's Pokémon Gym is soaked in\nthe sweat and tears of the Pokémon that\r\nworked so hard to dig it out of the rock.\r\nSo...well...it smells kinda funny!
Me and my Pokémon are\nprofessional tunnelers!\c\nMy Pokémon can't be outdug\nor outburrowed! We have no rival!\c
Drilbur and Excadrill know the move\nDrill Run!\c\nWhen I order them to use that move,\nI get all wound up!
I have a riddle for you!\nDo you know what is distant but close?\c
Something distant but close...\c\nI'm talking about Clay, who is near here\nbut is rather reserved.\c\nSorry... I think you were expecting\nsomething more interesting!
Here in the darkness...\c\nI proceeded step by step\nwhile feeling my Pokémon's every breath!\c\nI'll show you the power of the bonds\nmy Pokémon and I built in this way!\c
Isn't darkness great?\c\nIt's the space of dreams where\nyou don't know what's even there!
When I say dig,\nyou say, “How low?"\c
Life is filled with pitfalls!\nIf you fall in, do your best to crawl out!
Welcome to the Driftveil Gym!\nThis is for you!\c
Gym Leader Clay uses\nGround-type Pokémon!\c\nWell, just between you and me,\nGround-type Pokémon aren't good against\r\nWater-type attacks.\c\nThey also don't like Grass-\nor Ice-type attacks!\c\nOh, and in this Gym, the area you\nwalk on will light up.\c\nWhere you've been is a hint\nfor where you need to go!
Every now and again, I hope you look at\nthe Quake Badge you won here and\r\nremember your battle with Clay!

Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Bug Bite!\c\nWhen Bug Bite hits a target,\nyou can steal any Berry it's holding\r\nand use the effect for yourself!\c\nIf the user steals an Oran Berry\nor a Sitrus Berry, the user will not only\r\ndo damage, but it will heal itself as well!\c\nIt's doubly effective!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Covet!\c\nWhen a Pokémon hits a target\nwith Covet, it can steal the\r\nitem the target is holding!\c\nIf you steal a held item from a\nwild Pokémon, that item becomes\r\nyours when the battle ends!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Super Fang!\c\nSuper Fang halves the target's HP!\c\nThe user can do a consistent amount\nof damage even if it has low Attack\r\nor the target has high Defense!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Low Kick!\c\nThe heavier the target,\nthe more damage Low Kick does!\c\nIt's a Fighting-type move,\nso it works well against\r\nRock- and Steel-type Pokémon,\r\nwhich are often heavy!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Uproar!\c\nUproar does damage for\nthree turns after one use!\c\nA Pokémon that's in an uproar\ncan't use any other moves,\r\nand no Pokémon in battle can sleep!\c\nWhether that's an advantage or\ndisadvantage is up to you!

A Pokémon holding a Shell Bell recovers\nits HP a little bit if it inflicts damage\r\nduring a battle.\c\nBut what's more important is this. Have\nyou shown the Pokédex to a professor?

I'm touched that you came all the way\nhere, yet you are being so unkind.
To be clear, I would like to\nsee a Pokémon that knows [VAR 0107(0000)].\r\nThank you.

Let me introduce myself again.\nMy name is Rood.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You guys are all\nTeam Plasma too, right?\c\nTell me, what makes you different\nfrom the Team Plasma back there?!\c
Rood: More accurately, we're\nformer members of Team Plasma.\c\nBecause of the incident two years ago,\nwe started taking care of the Pokémon\r\nthat were separated from their Trainers\r\nas a way to atone for our misdeeds.\c\nAnd you are?\c
I'm [VAR 0100(0001)].\nFrom Aspertia City...\c\nFive years ago, Team Plasma--I mean\nyou--stole my little sister's Pokémon.\c\nI'm the pathetic Trainer who wasn't able\nto stop you.\c\n“Separated?" What a joke!\nYOU were the thieves who STOLE them!\c
Rood: Is that so...\nMy sincerest apologies...\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just an apology?\nThat's it?!\c
Where's my sister's Pokémon?!\c\nPurrloin! WHERE'S PURRLOIN?\c
Rood: The Pokémon you speak of\nis not in this place.\c\nI imagine it is still being\nused by Team Plasma now.\c\nJust as you say, our apologizing\ndoesn't solve anything.\c\nBut you can't move forward unless\nyou admit you were wrong and apologize...\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Enough already!\c\nApologizing isn't going to get\nmy sister's Pokémon back!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI'm going to the Pokémon Gym!\c\nI'll get stronger and crush every\nsingle member of Team Plasma!\c
Rood: Team Plasma made\nTrainers like him suffer...\c\nI feel terrible about it...\nHow foolish we were...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], as you can see,\nI can't do anything to thank you.\c\nActually, I have a favor to ask of you.\c\nCould you please look after this\nPokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Could you please look after this\nPokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Oh! Thank you!\c
Rood: Oh! Thank you!\c\n...But what's this? It seems you can't\ntake any more Pokémon with you.
Rood: If you change your mind,\nplease come speak to me again.
This Zorua was one of my lord N's friends,\nand it supported him.\c\nIn the Unova region, there are many\nother Pokémon that helped my lord N\r\nbesides this Zorua.
That Zorua is one of the Pokémon\nthat my lord N relied on as a friend\r\nduring his journey.
My lord N is a wonderful person\nwho has the power to understand\r\nthe hearts of Pokémon.\c\nBut still, he has much to learn about\nunderstanding the hearts of people...\c\nI hope he will develop this skill while\nhe travels with the legendary Pokémon\r\nto atone for the trouble he caused\r\nin Unova as the king of Team Plasma.
Team Plasma is an organization\ncreated by a man named Ghetsis\r\nto help him take over the Unova region.\c\nThe one he groomed to help him\nfurther his nefarious aims was N.\c\nN was a strange boy who was\ncalled the child of the Pokémon.
I wonder if N understands now.\c\nTrainers battle with Pokémon not to hurt\nthem, but so Trainers and Pokémon can\r\nunderstand one another better!\c\nIt's the simplest way\nfor them to do this.\c\nThe more serious the battle,\nthe more the true nature of Pokémon\r\nand people becomes apparent!
N was an orphan.\c\nI heard that right after he was born,\nhe upset people with behavior that\r\nsuggested he could talk to Pokémon.\c\nWhen he was living in the woods\nwith Darmanitan and Zorua,\r\nGhetsis took him in.\c\nWe are also orphans Ghetsis took in.\nOur task was to take care of N.
I don't understand N's\npure and innocent feelings.\c\nBut I will be very happy if he\nfigured out what he wants to do\r\non his own during his travels\r\nwith the legendary Pokémon.
I'm waiting for my lord N to return.\nHe can talk to Pokémon.\c\nIf he comes back, we can find out\nwhat the Pokémon here want.
We're taking care of the Pokémon\nwhose Trainers we can't find.\c\nI know it seems arrogant,\nbut it's a small way to make up\r\nfor what we've done.
You can't change the past,\nbut you can change the future!\c\nThat's why I changed my outfit.\nI can still fit into the old one, though!\r\nReally!
This Pokémon has become attached to me.\c\nThat's why I'm treating it like\na friend and not like a tool!
Bwoaf bowoaf!
Swwaaa!
Scrarara!
Skreeree...
Yeowwln!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\c\nI heard that Team Plasma left\nmany Pokémon behind when they fled.\c\nAnd I'm helping find their\nreal Trainers...\c\nThat aside...\c\nSince you're here, you should have a\nbattle with me before you go!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nhave a battle with me before you go!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Here I come!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well, that's all right\ntoo, I guess!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I suppose that's it.\c\nIf winning in battles is strength,\nthen believing that your Pokémon\r\nwill come back and waiting for its return\r\nis also strength.\c\nDoing what you think is right\nno matter what anyone else says,\r\nlike these guys do, is strength, too.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCome back tomorrow!\c\nI'll take you on again!\nThat's my way of saying thanks!

You! Glad you came!\nGet good at Expert Belts!\c\nIf a Pokémon has an Expert Belt, the\npower of its moves is slightly boosted\r\nwhen they are super effective!
There must be a convenient town where\neverything is imported and everything\r\nis available.
Somewhere, there's a laid-back town\nwhere people value the year's seasons.\c\nI heard we've imported a lot of goods\nfrom that town!
Looking at seasonal vegetables is fun.\c\nBecause when the seasons change,\nthe vegetables available change!
Whenever we come to the market,\nvegetables of all seasons are available.\c\nIsn't that a marvel?
Goods carried away from Driftveil arrive\nin a town somewhere else...\c\nYeah. The world is connected.

Still, I'm amazed how much Pokémon\ndistribution changes in two years.\c\nThat means my research will never end.\nStill, you could say that's what\r\nmakes it fun...\c
???: Professor Juniperrrrr!\c
Professor Juniper: Why, if it isn't Skyla!\c
This is Skyla.\nShe's Mistralton City's Gym Leader.\c
Skyla: Why are you surprised, Professor?\c\nYou did ask for a lift in my plane to\ncross Twist Mountain, since you can't\r\nreach Opelucid City by foot.\c
Professor Juniper: Aha ha! You're right.\nBut I have a quick favor to ask first.\c\nI want a look at Celestial Tower.\nDo you mind waiting till I'm through?\c
See you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nBe sure to always get along\nwith all kinds of Pokémon!\c
Skyla: Honestly! I can't tell if she's\njust laid back or if she's not paying\r\nattention to anything outside her head.\c\nThe apple sure doesn't\nfall far from the tree.\c
What's next?\nAre you coming to my Gym to challenge me?\c\nOr are you going to follow the professor\nto Celestial Tower and do some training?\c\nAs long as I get to battle with a strong\nTrainer, I'm fine either way!\c
Skyla: Time for a quick hop in my plane!\c\nHey, where did Professor Juniper get to?\c
I wonder if she's still doing research\nin Celestial Tower?\c\nMmm... Could I ask you\nto go get the professor?\c\nI've got to finish flight preparations\nat Mistralton Cargo Service!\c
Professor Juniper: Hi there!\c\nI hope we can get some good\nresearch done on the other side\r\nof the mountain as well.\c\nThat's right! I want you to\ntake this flight, too!\c
There's someone I want you to\nmeet in Opelucid City,\r\nbut we can't get through\r\nTwist Mountain right now.\c\nWe'll just make a quick flight\nover to Lentimas Town!\c\nI'll be waiting for you in\nMistralton Cargo Service!\c
Skyla: Hey! Professor! Wait up!\c\nHonestly... She just does\neverything at her own pace!\c
OK! You come, too!\c
We've arranged it so Mistralton's planes\nare now available for passenger service.\c\nIt's not like everyone's Pokémon\ncan use Fly!
Fly is an amazing move!\c\nEven a teeny-weeny Pokémon\ncan carry a person easily!
That Skyla...\nShe's even surpassed her grandpa,\r\nwho was a legendary pilot!
Mistralton City used to be a\ndesolate patch of land...\c\nThis place was built through the\ncooperation of people and Pokémon.
Planes need a runway to fly,\nbut Pokémon don't need a thing!\c\nBut planes can carry a lot more\ncargo than Pokémon can.
Team Plasma went after certain\nPokémon, like Purrloin!\c\nMany people had their Pokémon stolen.\nThat's just unforgivable!
If you want to eat delicious vegetables,\nthe ones grown in the wild are the best.\c\nSometimes they are eaten by Pokémon...\nAh, I mean we can give them to Pokémon.
Vegetables grown efficiently\nin a greenhouse are the best.\c\nTheir nutrients all go into forming\na very delicious vegetable!
Oh! You found our treasure!\c
Found it!\c
Just kidding!\c\nOur Ducklett already knows Aerial Ace.\nSo we'll give you this TM!\c
Just kidding!\c\nOur Ducklett already knows Aerial Ace.\nSo we'll give you this TM!\c
Aerial Ace always hits its target!\nI hope it comes in handy!\c
Kwa!
See you! Bye-bye!\c
Hey, what's up?\c\nI know! Since you're here,\nI'll tell you a little secret!\c
Please keep this a secret from Elesa, OK?
Know what?\nMy Pokémon loves Berries!\c\nThat's why I'm wandering all over,\nlooking for Berries!\c\nI dream about a wonderful city somewhere\nthat is overflowing with Berries...\c
The Funfest Mission\n“[VAR 0140(0000)]"\r\nhas been added to the Entralink.
My Pokémon's favorite\nBerry is the Leppa Berry!\c\nIt restores PP!\nIsn't it a useful Berry?
Do you know the big street\ncalled [VAR 0139(0000)]?\c\nThere are a lot of unique shops there!\nIt's so cool!

Hee-hee!\nI've been waiting for you.\c\nYou're a tough Trainer who can face the\nwind and not get blown off your feet!\c\nI'm kinda excited about this battle!\nWhy don't you and I have some fun?\c
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer.\c\nMy Pokémon and I are happy\nbecause for the first time in quite a\r\nwhile--about two years, I'd say--we\r\ncould fight with our full strength.\c\nThis is an official League Gym Badge.\nBut this is just a stepping-stone.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nJet Badge from Skyla.\c
Wow, hot stuff!\c\nWith that many Gym Badges,\nPokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you.\c\nAlso, I want you to have this TM\nso that you'll always remember\r\nthis Pokémon battle.\c
I wonder what Professor Juniper\nis up to?\c\nI did promise her a ride in my plane...
Two things that are both really fun:\nflying my own plane and having my\r\nPokémon take me places using Fly!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well?\nOur battle together was a ton of fun.\c\nWhenever my Pokémon think of our battle,\nthey want to start training again.\c\nIt might be a cool idea to take my plane\nand go on a training trip together!
Ow...\c\nOh, I'm sorry!\c\nAllow me to apologize by giving you this\nFresh Water! Take it, please.\c
This Gym is a wind tunnel!\c\nWhen the propellers in back start\nspinning quickly, you'll be blown\r\naway like a certain someone just was!\c\nWhen you think the wind will blow,\nstay hidden behind a wall\r\nand wait for it to stop.\c\nBy the way, Flying-type Pokémon have\nmore weaknesses than you might expect,\r\nincluding to Rock-, Electric-, and\r\nIce-type moves!

Professor Juniper is researching\nPokémon at Celestial Tower,\r\nwhich is at the end of Route 7.\c\nPay attention to the signs\nso you don't get lost on the way.
Looks like the Professor's reached a\nstopping point in her investigation.\c\nReady to hop aboard my plane?
Hee-hee!\nReady for takeoff!
Roger!\nCome talk to me when you're ready.
Are you ready to get aboard the plane?\nThe sky is calling!
Professor Juniper: Hi there!\nLooks like I kept you waiting! Sorry...\c\nShall we give Skyla her chance to\nshow us her piloting skills?
OK, Skyla, we're ready.\nPlease take us to Lentimas Town!\c
Bianca: Waaaaaaaaaaait!\c\nYou guys! Wait, wait, wait, wait!\nHff...pff...I want to fly, too!\c\nI want to do some research\nin Reversal Mountain...hff...pff...\c
Professor Juniper: Bianca, you're here?\c\nYou're starting to show the dedication\nof a serious researcher these days!\c\nOK, everyone, off we go to Lentimas Town!\c
Skyla: Hee-hee!\nLooks like everyone's here!\c\nFinally, it's time to fly\nthe Unova skies!\c
Hello!\nThis is Mistralton Cargo Service.\c\n“Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!"\c\nWe can also carry passengers now,\nbut that's up to the Gym Leader.
Hello!\nThis is Mistralton Cargo Service.\c\n“Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!"\nWould you like to board the flight\r\nto Lentimas Town?
OK. We will contact Skyla,\nso please board the plane and wait.\c
OK!\nFeel free to fly with us anytime!
This is Mistralton Cargo Service.\n“Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!"\c
Oh!\nThat's a Permit!\c\nThat lets you enter the\nNature Preserve, which is far,\r\nfar away from the Unova region!\c\nWould you like to go to the\nNature Preserve, then?

Hey!\nDo you have any Flying- or\r\nPsychic-type Pokémon with you?\c
Oh!\n[VAR 0101(0000)] is with you!\c\nWould you help me get some luggage\nthat's too high for me to reach?\c
Here's a little something to\nthank you for helping me!\c
Having Pokémon with you\ncan be a big help sometimes, eh?
That's too bad.\c\nI need a Flying- or Psychic-type\nPokémon to help me out.
Chulululuwa!
Hrmph! You there!\nDo you have the Ace Pilot Medal?\c\nWe Pilots figure that's the coolest\nMedal of them all, so I thought a\r\ncool customer like you might have it!
If you get the Ace Pilot Medal,\nplease come show it to me!
Ooh! Is that it? Shiny!\c\nTh-the Ace Pilot Medal...\c\nBrimming with adventure,\nshimmering like the sky--\r\nthe Ace Pilot Medal!\c\nSo cool.\nThank you for letting me see it!
“Ace Pilot"...\nThere's a splendid sound to that.\c\nHere's to you and your Pokémon\nfor flying freely through the skies!\c\nFor my part, I'll keep working on\nmy skills as an airplane pilot!
Welcome to the city of the skies,\nMistralton City!\r\nHere's a souvenir for you.\c

Sweets, lovely Sweet Hearts! ♪\nCheck feelings between two people.\c\nIf you are a great match, you can\nget sweet on Sweet Hearts! ♪\r\nMeltingly sweet Sweet Hearts! ♪\c
Oh, uh, you?\nYou have Sweet Hearts!\c\nWill you trade 10 Sweet Hearts\nfor my Heart Scale?
I'm in a special mood today!\c\nWould you trade me five Sweet Hearts\nfor a Heart Scale?
If you bring a lot of Sweet Hearts,\nI will trade you for something happy!
Yaaaay!\nI have a lot of your heart!\c
Oh... What a pity.\nWhat a great pity!\c\nYou must have a lot of\nHeart Scales already.
OK...\nAww...that's too bad.
Gave the Sweet Hearts and received\na Heart Scale in return.\c

Trading Sweet Hearts you receive\nthrough Feeling Checks is one way\r\nto get Heart Scales.\c\nIf you show off your Pokémon\nto a lady in Driftveil City, you\r\ncan get Heart Scales, too.
I'm very fussy about\nPokémon moves.\c\nI'm extra fussy about\nTechnical Machines! Yes, TMs!\c\nHow many TMs have you collected\nso far?
I'll give you something great\nwhen you collect a lot of TMs!\r\nLet me see a lot of TMs!
Oh! You're a TM Master!\c\nThank you for showing me\na lot of TMs.\c\nUse lots of different moves, and\nbring out your Pokémon's power!
Hmm...\c\nYou have [VAR 0201(0000)] TMs!
Oh!\nI've never seen some of these before!\c\nWow!\nI didn't even know such TMs existed.\c\nI can tell you've selected each one\nwith so much care.\c\nThank you! I was thrilled to see them!\c\nAs a reward, please accept this\n[VAR 0109(0000)] as a gift!\c
There must be a lot more TMs!\c\nIf you collect even more of them,\nI'll give you another fantastic gift!
Wow! Great job!\nYou've got great technical points!\c\nI didn't know there were so many TMs!\c\nThanks to you, I realized\nthe true depth of TMs!\c\nYou are a TM Master!\nThank you very much!
Some kind people will give you TMs.\nSo don't be shy! Talk to everyone!
Gym Leaders will give you a TM for sure\nif you beat them!\c\nBut you already know that, don't you?
Do you know the Battle Subway\nin Nimbasa City?\c\nDefeat Trainers there and\ncollect a lot of BP,\r\nand you can get TMs!
I don't know who would be careless\nenough to drop them, but you can\r\nsometimes find TMs in places where\r\nyou'd least expect them.
You can also buy TMs\nat Poké Marts!\c\nThey're a bit expensive, though.

Zinzolin: It's bitter cold.\c\nI'm shivering.\nI'm suffering, but I'm alive!\c\nIt's what the essence of life feels like!\nIt's proof of my existence!\c\nBut that's enough of philosophy.\nHere are the facts for your admiration:\c\nThis ice was specially created by\nTeam Plasma's technology.\c\nAs long as we have our secret weapon,\nyou'll never be able\r\nto melt or break this ice!\c
Let me explain our purpose here.\c\nDrayden, hand over the DNA Splicers!\c\nOpelucid City is a city where the\npast and the future are entwined.\c\nCould there be a more perfect place\nfor the splicers that connect the\r\nseparated Pokémon?\c
Drayden: Do you think someone\nwho knows what you did two years\r\nago will just hand them over quietly?\c
Zinzolin: Humph.\nThat's what I thought you'd say.\c\nAt this point, I'd like to threaten\nyou with another volley of ice,\r\nbut we can't use it for a moment...\c\nSigh. It won't be enjoyable in this cold,\nbut I guess we'll just search for them.\c
Drayden: Those foul villains!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI want you to help me!\c\nWe're going to drive Team Plasma\nout of Opelucid City!\c
Team Plasma: Pokémon are pawns!\nThey're a means to an end.\c\nThat's what I was taught!\c\nDon't think about it too much.\nIt's easier that way!\c
Team Plasma: How can this be?\c\nIs that the kind of power Pokémon have\nwhen they're not treated like objects?
Team Plasma: The others were saying\nthat the only place we haven't yet\r\nsearched is the Pokémon Gym!
Team Plasma: This time, we'll take over\nthe Unova region!\c\nYou! You're trembling already?\nFrom fear or from cold--either's good!\c
Team Plasma: It's not over!\nThe others will find the DNA Splicers!\r\nWhen they do, the Unova region is ours!
Team Plasma: Now that you mention it,\nI think I might have been ordered\r\nto comb the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: Don't get in our way!\nYou bother!\r\nBother, bother, bother!\c
Team Plasma: How humiliating...\nBeing bothered by a bother...
Team Plasma: Zinzolin said to stick to\nDrayden, because that's where we'll\r\nfind anything important!
Team Plasma: I lost.\nI didn't stand a chance...\c\nI can't believe Haxorus blasted me\nall the way over here!
Team Plasma: I think Zinzolin was going\nto check the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: I've been nursing a\ngrudge for two years, old man.\c\n...Even if this is the first time\nI've battled you!
Drayden: They're getting tougher!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nTake care of the others!
Drayden: The only one left is\nZinzolin of the Seven Sages!\r\nWhere could he be?\c\nOh!\nWhat's going on at the Pokémon Gym?!
Team Plasma: That old guy won't hold\nback even if his opponent is a young girl.
Team Plasma: Oh, that Drayden!\nWhere did he hide the DNA Splicers?\r\nSomewhere familiar and common, right?
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud...\c\nI didn't expect to have to fight\nhampered by cold like this.\c\nWell, no matter! The fact that I'm\nshivering means I'm truly alive!\c
Zinzolin: You're a strong Trainer.\c\nYou definitely are adept\nat handling Pokémon.\c\nI believe I'll take my leave, simply\nbecause I can't stand this cold.\c\nBut...imagine this...\c\nA Unova region...completely...covered...\nin...ice.\c\nTo achieve that splendor,\nwe'll do whatever it takes\r\nto obtain the DNA Splicers.\c
Drayden: You're even better than I\nhoped. Thanks to you, we drove them off.\c\nI'm grateful to your Pokémon, also.\c\nAfter all that, the least I can do\nis heal them with this medicine.\c
Wait here a moment.\nI'll be right back.\c
Harrumph...\c\nThat's a new record for\nmaking it there and back.\c
Look, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThese are the DNA Splicers!\c
This is what they were after!\c\nWe're really fortunate Team Plasma\ndidn't get their hands on them!\c\nI don't know what their goal is, but I'm\nsure they're planning something wicked.\c
Shadow Triad: As we suspected...\nThe hiding place was in the Gym.\c\nWell thought out.\nIf Drayden isn't there, we can't get in.\c\nIf he is there, he's the strongest\nguard we could possibly face.\c\nIt also explains why the\nPokémon Gym was remodeled.\c\nWhatever.\nThe DNA Splicers are in our hands now.\c
Drayden: It's beyond my imagination to\nthink you'd use one of the Seven Sages\r\nto find out where the splicers were!\c
Shadow Triad: Now you know, then.\c\nWe will accomplish our goals,\nno matter what the cost.\c\nWe don't have the ability to captivate\nthe hearts of others like Lord N does.\c\nInstead, we will bend people\nto our will with brute force.\r\nTwo years was a surprisingly long wait.\c
Drayden: If they've been stolen from us,\nwe'll just have to take them back!\c
Drayden: They don't seem to be in\nthis area. However, they can hide their\r\npresence, so be on guard as you look!
Shadow Triad: Heh heh...\c\nYou don't really think you can take\nthe DNA Splicers back, do you?\c
Shadow Triad: Awww. How unlucky.\c\nI don't happen to be the one\nholding the DNA Splicers.\c\nI was just buying time\nfor the others to escape.\r\nCheerio, bye-bye, whatever.\c
Drayden: Oh no! Ah! No!\c\nNo, no, it's not your fault, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou were impressive!\c\nIt's me who's let everybody down.\c
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
[VAR 0100(0000)] picked up the Xtransceiver.\c
Drayden: Augh!\nIf there were only two of me!\c\nThen I could protect the town\nand chase after them, too!\c
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)].\nDrayden, glad to see you're safe as well.\c
Drayden: Hello, Cheren.\nYou have certainly grown.\c\nI hear you filled in for Lenora by\nbecoming the Gym Leader in\r\nAspertia City.\c
Cheren: Thanks.\nWe should save catching up for later.\c\nI have a good idea of where\nTeam Plasma is hiding.\c\nThe place with the lowest temperature\nin the Unova region right now is\r\nan area close to Humilau City.\c\nDrayden, please protect Opelucid City.\n[VAR 0100(0001)] and I will find Team Plasma!\c
Drayden: Very well.\nI'll do my part--and thanks.\c\nThe chase I'll leave to you!\nBut...don't do anything reckless.\c
Cheren: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI could use your help, if you're willing.\c\nYou're a skilled Trainer who can go\ntoe-to-toe with Team Plasma.\r\nThat's my definition of useful.\c\nDrayden, we're off!\c
Drayden: Humilau City, huh...\c\nIs there anything to the\nnorth of Undella Town?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], protect Pokémon\nfrom Team Plasma!\c\nAll people should think for themselves\nabout the nature of the relationship\r\nbetween people and Pokémon.\c\nIt's not something Team Plasma gets\nto decide for everyone!
Drayden: Little by little,\nthe ice is starting to melt.\c\nIt's all thanks to you.\nAs a fellow Trainer, I heartily thank you!
Why do Pokémon stay by our sides?\c\nIf we could talk to them, we could ask.\nI'm a bit scared about what they'd say.
The memories of everyone who has lived\nin this city have built up over the years\r\nwithout changing much.
This city changes endlessly.\c\nAnd every change is engraved in the\nmemories of the people who live here.
I reached heights I never could\nhave arrived at because I had\r\nPokémon by my side.\c\nAnd I believe my Pokémon became\ntough because they were with me!
I think some things shouldn't be\nchanged, even if it's inconvenient.
I think some things must be changed\nno matter how much you love them!
A person called N had the\nlegendary Pokémon with him,\r\nbut was he really the hero?
A world of ice.\c\nSuch beauty goes beyond old and new--\ninspirational, yet terrifying.\c\nThough, to me, there's a comfort in\nold things that you can't find in the new.
A world of ice.\c\nSuch beauty goes beyond new and old--\ninspirational, yet terrifying.\c\nThough, to me, there's a coolness to new\nthings that I prize more than the old.
Gym Leader Drayden leads\nOpelucid City as its mayor!\c\nHe's always training by wrestling\nwith his Pokémon.
My Pokémon show me affection,\nso I'm not lonely!\c\nAnd I return their affection even more!
There was a group that told\npeople to release their Pokémon.\c\nThey were great big liars, but it\ncreated a good opportunity to think.
After that speech, my Pokémon\nand I have been thinking about\r\nwhat's true for us.
After that speech, I've been thinking\nabout the ideal relationship for me and\r\nmy Pokémon as we move forward together.
Unova's symbols are\nZekrom and Reshiram,\r\nbut I wonder where they are now.\c\nAre they passing along their\nancient knowledge to someone?
Pursuing ideals is different from person\nto person and Pokémon to Pokémon.\c\nIn this city, it seems the ideal is\nto cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different\nfrom person to person and\r\nPokémon to Pokémon.\c\nIn this city, it seems the truth is\nconstant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put\ninto this melody...\c\nI will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody...\nI will send them to the future.
I was just reminded of Iris.\c\nYes, the Champion.\nThat Iris...\c
I wonder what kind of\nChampion she'll become.

Well, now. You've obtained seven of\nthe Gym Badges in Unova.\c\nThat means Pokémon up to Lv. 80,\nincluding those received in trades,\r\nwill follow your commands obediently.\c\nI also want you to have this.\nIt's a TM I'm particularly fond of.\c\nIt's called Dragon Tail.\c
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the\ndamaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball.\c\nIn other words, it switches your\nopponent's Pokémon.\c

Drayden: Let me tell you the story.\nIt's a long story, but listen closely.\c
It was two years ago when the two\ndragon Pokémon were awakened.\c\nThe black dragon Pokémon, Zekrom,\npursued what is ideal, with the desire\r\nto usher in a new world of hope.\c\nAnd the white dragon Pokémon, Reshiram,\nsought what is true, with the desire\r\nto usher in a new world of goodness.\c\nZekrom and Reshiram\nwere once a single Pokémon.\c
It was two years ago when the two\ndragon Pokémon were awakened.\c\nThe white dragon Pokémon, Reshiram,\nsought what is true, with the desire\r\nto usher in a new world of goodness.\c\nAnd the black dragon Pokémon, Zekrom,\npursued what is ideal, with the desire\r\nto usher in a new world of hope.\c\nReshiram and Zekrom\nwere once a single Pokémon.\c
You may wonder why it split in two.\c\nThe single dragon Pokémon had helped the\ntwin heroes bring a new region into being.\c\nBut the twin heroes--the older brother\nwho sought the truth and the\r\nyounger brother who sought ideals--\r\nsundered the region in two as they\r\nfought to see which of them was right.\c\nIn that desperate hour, the single\ndragon Pokémon split its body into a\r\nblack Pokémon and a white Pokémon,\r\neven though ideals and truth\r\ndon't need to be in opposition!\c
You may wonder why it split in two.\c\nThe single dragon Pokémon had helped the\ntwin heroes bring a new region into being.\c\nBut the twin heroes--the younger\nbrother who sought ideals and the older\r\nbrother who sought the truth--sundered\r\nthe region in two as they fought to see\r\nwhich of them was right.\c\nIn that desperate hour, the single\ndragon Pokémon split its body into a\r\nwhite Pokémon and a black Pokémon,\r\neven though ideals and truth\r\ndon't need to be in opposition!\c
As the story goes, a third\ndragon Pokémon, [VAR FF00(0002)]Kyurem[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\nalso came into existence in that era.\c\nAnd there may be proof of this to be\nfound in a treasure passed down in my\r\nfamily for generations: the DNA Splicers.\c\nProfessor Juniper's research determined\nthat the materials in the splicers date\r\nback to the same era as the materials\r\nused in building the Dragonspiral Tower.\c
Oh, the DNA Splicers\nare stored very safely.\c\nI guard them because I don't know\nwhat kind of power might lie within them.\c\nBut here's what's been bothering me...\nCould there be one more dragon Pokémon?\c\nEven if Kyurem really exists,\nwe don't know what kind of Pokémon it is.\c\nFor starters, the two Pokémon\nthe ancient Pokémon split into\r\nare both overwhelmingly powerful.\c\nSo if Kyurem exists, could it be just\na husk--a shell that was left over?\c
Boom!\c
Drayden: Hm?\c\nWhat was that sound?\c

I was Iris's coach!\c\nEven from the day Iris came here,\nshe was so much stronger than me!\c\nNow, I wouldn't stand a chance!
Even Drayden can't handle a\nstrange situation like this alone...
Drayden teaches the move Draco Meteor.\nIt's the strongest Dragon-type move.\c\nBut the Special Attack of the Pokémon\nthat uses it drops sharply.
Concerned about your Pokémon's weight?\c\nYou don't need to put it on a diet!\nJust let it hold this.\c
The weight of a Pokémon holding a\nFloat Stone will be halved!\c\nThat way, you can reduce the damage\ncaused by weight-based moves such as\r\nLow Kick and Grass Knot.
Wh-what's going\nto happen to Opelucid City?
I have an item that I don't know how to\nuse. Would you give it a try and see if\r\nyou can make it work?
I know...\nYou'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!\c
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can\nbe hit even by a move that would usually\r\nhave no effect.\c\nFor example, a Normal-type move would\nhit a Ghost-type Pokémon.\c\nMastering this item is a bit tough...\nActually, it's very tough, but think\r\nhow useful it could be!
It's cold...\c\nAnd Dragon types really don't like cold!

Pursuing ideals...\nWhat does that really mean?\c\nYou see, there was this guy called N,\nwho the legendary Pokémon Zekrom\r\nrecognized as the hero...

Instead of getting a Pokémon\nwith the Ability Run Away,\r\nI got these!\c\nI have tons of these,\nso I'll share with you!\c
A Pokémon that's holding a\nSmoke Ball will always be able\r\nto run away from a wild Pokémon!

I wonder if the Elite Four in the\nPokémon League like Pokémon more\r\nthan anyone else.\c\nIf you don't like Pokémon,\nyou'll never get good at battling, right?
You need to have eight Gym Badges\nto take on the pinnacle of Pokémon,\r\nthe Pokémon League!
Raaah!

The Pokémon League is a place where you\nboth pursue strength and express it.\c\nThe way to express it is simple...\c\nYou just have to beat the Elite Four and\nthe Champion!\c\nYou can start your challenge by battling\nany of the Elite Four, and if you defeat\r\nthem all, you can challenge the Champion!\c\nHowever! I warn you, once you start\nyour challenge, there's no turning back.\c\nYou must keep battling until you defeat\nthem all...or are defeated yourself.\c\nDo you want to go in?
Once you start your challenge,\nyou cannot leave until you win against all\r\nor lose! Do you want to go in?
Then, proceed!\c
Don't neglect preparation!\c\nGo through the entrance there, and\nprepare as much as possible. Make sure\r\nyour Pokémon are fully recovered!\c

Words are engraved on the statue:\c\n“Four great warriors form\n this Pokémon League.\c\n To the southwest is one who\n does not fear the Ghost type.\c\n To the southeast is one who\n channels the power of the Fighting type.\c\n To the northwest is one who\n has mastered the Dark type.\c\n To the northeast is one who\n knows the mind of the Psychic type.\c\n If you can defeat these warriors with\n your courage and wisdom,\r\n you shall be led to the summit,\r\n where the strongest Champion awaits."

My Pokémon and the challenger's Pokémon.\c\nEveryone battled even though\nthey were hurt... Thank you.
Fortitude is needed if you're going\nto battle, don't you think?\c\nBecause both you and your opponent\nget hurt.\c\nBut if you don't understand the pain,\nyou'll focus on the result and forget\r\nabout the bonds with your Pokémon.\c\nThat's why I want to write passages\nfull of heart and soul in my novels.
Challenger, if you defeat the entire\nElite Four of the Pokémon League,\r\nyou can go on to challenge the Champion.\c\nAnd you have earned that right.\c\nReturn to the plaza in the center\nand check the statue.
“‘Go, Volcarona!\n  Use Heat Wave here!'\r\n  The Trainer solemnly ordered\r\n  the Pokémon who resembled\r\n  his first partner..."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers and\r\nthe Pokémon that I've competed against.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c
“‘Do you know Thunderbolt?' was\n  his first greeting to me.\c\n  It wasn't until after we battled that\n  I learned his name was Volkner."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers and\r\nthe Pokémon that I've competed against.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c
“‘Hey, you! Use Overheat!'\c\n  A Fire-type Pokémon user\n  with a hairstyle that would be great\r\n  with Head Charge just gave the order\r\n  and left..."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers and\r\nthe Pokémon that I've competed against.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c
“The woman who uses Ghost types,\n  and the woman who uses Ground types.\c\n  I couldn't ask the reason\n  why their names and appearances\r\n  are so similar."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers and\r\nthe Pokémon that I've competed against.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c
“‘Yes. My code name is Looker.'\c\n  He sounded a bit aloof, but his partner\n  Croagunk's strategy was tricky."\c\nThat's part of a novel I wrote.\c\nI absolutely love writing about the close\nbonds between the Trainers and\r\nthe Pokémon that I've competed against.\c\nCould I use you and your Pokémon as\na subject?\c
All the Pokémon on both sides\nbattled so bravely.\r\nEven though they got hurt...\c\nThank you.
It's important to be tough and resilient\nwhen you battle, don't you think?\c\nYou have to accept that both sides will\nget hurt. You have to understand that\r\nthe pain of losing is a natural outcome.\c\nIf you just focus on winning, you can\nforget that the bond between you and\r\nyour Pokémon is the most important thing.\c\nI try to focus on that bond in my novels.\nI want them to be full of heart and soul!
Challenger, if you defeat the entire\nElite Four of the Pokémon League, you\r\ncan go on to challenge the Champion.\c\nAnd you have earned that right.\c\nYour story is yours and yours alone.\nPlease weave a wonderful tale!

What will be determined here is\nwhich of us can absorb the opponent's\r\nlight and shine...\c\nBut who will decide that?\c\nIt shall be I, Grimsley of the Elite Four,\nand I will fulfill my duty to be\r\nyour opponent.\c
Whether or not you get to fight at full\nstrength, whether or not luck smiles\r\non you--none of that matters.\c\nOnly results matter. And a loss is a loss.\c\nSee, victory shines like a bright light.\c\nAnd right now, you and your Pokémon\nare shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than\nthe one who lost his light...\c\nBut this loss will make me shine\neven brighter next time...\c\nIf I think that way, it's not too bad.\c\nSigh...\c\nYou should take that strength and test\nit against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing!\c\nYou have defeated every member of\nthe Pokémon League's Elite Four.\c\nBut it isn't over yet.\c\nThere is one more opponent against whom\nyou must prove your strength.\c\nCheck the statue in the central plaza,\nand continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have\nto use the tools you're given.\c\nIt's more important to master the cards\nyou're holding than to complain about\r\nthe ones your opponents were dealt.\c\nLet us begin.\nAnd may the best Trainer win!\c\nContests like this are proof\nthat you are really living...\c
There are bad ways to win--\nand good ways to lose.\c\nWhat's interesting and troubling is that\nit's not always clear which is which.\c\nA flipped coin doesn't always land\nheads or tails.\c\nSometimes it may never land at all...
There's nothing left\nfor the loser.\c\nI guess that's not true...\nEverything has a meaning.\c\nI just have to use the disappointment\nas a motivation to get strong.\c\nThat said...\nYou should take that strength and test\r\nit against the rest of the Elite Four!

Greetings, challenger.\nMy name is Marshal.\c\nI am the No. 1 pupil of my mentor, Alder.\c\nIn order to master the art of fighting,\nI've kept training.\c\nYou're also walking a similar path\nwith your Pokémon.\c\nIt is my intention to test you--to take\nyou to the limits of your strength. Kiai!\c
You look familiar...\nAh, yes.

You are a strong challenger.\c\nWalk the path you believe in\nwith the Pokémon you believe in.\c\nThe other members of the Elite Four\nare far more powerful than I am.\c\nDo not underestimate them!
Now... You have become the strongest\nTrainer in this Pokémon League.\c\nThe statue in the central chamber will\ntake you to the Champion's room.
I thank you deeply for the chance for\nanother round of combat against you.\c\nIn myself, I seek to develop\nthe strength of a fighter.\c\nAnd shatter any weakness in myself!\c\nPrevailing with the force of\nmy convictions!\c\nVictory, decisive victory, is my intention!\nChallenger, here I come!\c
There are still many strong Trainers\nin this Pokémon League.\c\nYou should deepen your bonds with\nyour Pokémon by battling with them.
During the days when I was young,\nI was wandering all the regions\r\nof the world.\c\nI was devoted only to training,\nin order to surpass my mentor.\c\nAnd when I felt so ashamed\ntwo years ago...\c\nMy Pokémon were always there for me.\c\nThat thought crossed my mind\neven though I was completely focused\r\non our battle...\c\nYou're a mysterious Trainer.
The strength shown by you and your\nPokémon has deeply impressed me...\c\nPlease, continue to the next room\nto face the strongest Trainer\r\nof the Unova region!

You haven't faced all of the members\nof the Elite Four yet, have you?\c\nDon't concern yourself about me.\nGo on ahead.
Winning is important,\nbut what's more important is\r\nwhether I've done better this time.\c\nBecause if I can't surpass myself,\nI can't get close to my ideals.\c\nI want to improve and win more elegantly,\nso I invite you to be my opponent\r\nagain in the future, if you wish.
Somehow, you managed to defeat the\nentire Elite Four of the Pokémon League.\c\nCheck the statue in the center of the\nplaza for the way to the Champion's room.

Alas! Even with the knowledge and skill\npassed down in my family of Trainers,\r\nI still can't win.\c\nThe reason I came here in the first place\nwas to encounter Trainers like you...
When I battle you,\nI can't help but smile...\c\nBecause I was able to improve myself,\nand because you're an excellent Trainer.\c\nI want to improve and win more elegantly,\nso I invite you to be my opponent\r\nagain in the future, if you wish.
You have defeated the\nPokémon League's Elite Four.\c\nYou have earned the right to\nproceed to the Champion's room.\c\nMaking an entrance is not the point.\c\nOnce you're there, you'll need to\nunleash your power to the fullest!

Awesome! The ceiling is sooo high!\c\nI wonder how many of me\nyou'd have to stack up to reach it?
Coming to Unity Tower always\ngets me excited!\c\nBeing here always reminds me of how big\nthe world really is!
You're a new face.\nIs this your first time here?\c\nUnity Tower is the place where\nTrainers come from all over the world.\c\nThat's why I work hard every day doing\nsecurity checks to protect those\r\nyoung Trainers.\c\nDon't loiter around here\nand cause trouble.\r\n...'Kay, you can pass.\c
                                          
Seems like I've met you somewhere...\nAnyway, don't get too wound up and fall.\c\nWhen guests get hurt, it causes me\nno end of trouble.\c\n...'Kay, you can pass.\c
Oh! So you're a Trainer, then!\c\nI see. You're far from family\nand traveling the world, huh?\c\nI suppose it's fine if you contact them\nonce in a while.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Oh, it's you.\c\nHmm... You like trading, do you now?\c\nWell, that's all right, isn't it.\nYou're active--just like a young person\r\nshould be.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Oh, it's you.\c\nSeems like you come here a lot.\nDo you have friends all over the world?\c\nI'd never have imagined a world like this\nwhen I was young.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Oh, it's you, [VAR 0100(0003)]!\c\nLately, lots of Trainers have been\nlooking for you.\r\nYou're just like a movie star, aren't ya?\c\nWhen I was your age, the ladies\nused to get worked up over me. Ha ha.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Hey, it's you, [VAR 0100(0003)]!\c\nRecently, it looks like there have been\nlots of global Trainers like you.\c\nThat means--how do I put it--world peace\ncan't be far off!\r\nShould I get my hopes up?\c\n'Kay, pass on through!\c
Oh, it's you, [VAR 0100(0003)]!\c\nIt feels like since you've started\ncoming, Unity Tower has gotten busier.\c\nThere's been a lot more work for this\nold guy, but that's a problem I'm\r\nhappy to have.\c\nKeep up the good work!\c
Hey, [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nYou've managed to trade with folks in\neven more places, huh?\c\nThat's really something!\nI'd imagine your Pokédex is getting\r\npretty full, then?\c\nWow, you're amazing!\n'Kay, pass on through.\c

Hey, it's you, [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nAfter trading with this many people, you\nmust have friends all over the world!\c\nHa ha. If you go on a trip, no worries\nabout not knowing anyone, huh?\c\n'Kay, please pass through!\c
Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0003)]!\c\nI almost feel like I don't need to bother\nwith a security check for you anymore.\r\nYou can go ahead and pass.\c\n...Gotcha!\nI've been a security guard for 30 years!\c\nI know trouble just waits for you\nto let your guard down.\r\n...'Kay, you can pass.\c
Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nI'll just do a brief security check.\c\n...W-what's this? Ooh, it's a kind of gum\nI've never seen! Is it a new brand?\r\nMaybe I'll buy some later.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.\c
Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0003)].\c\nJust a little more, and you'll have\ntraded with every place here, huh?\c\nIt's really reassuring to me that kids\nlike you are going to be the ones running\r\nthe world!\r\nJust a little more to go. You can do it!\c\n'Kay, you can pass!\c
It's you, [VAR 0100(0003)]!\nI already heard!\c\nYou've finally managed to trade with\npeople from every location, right?\c\nIt might just be me, but Unity Tower\nfeels more exciting when you visit.\r\nI'm sure it's happy to see you.\c\nHey, [VAR 0100(0003)], I'd like to give my\nthanks as the Unity Tower guard for\r\nmaking this building out in the middle\r\nof nowhere so lively.\c\n'Kay, you can pass.

Hey, you over there!\nCome here for a second.\c
Don't just loiter around\nand cause trouble.
Don't get too wound up.\c\nIf you run around, fall, and get hurt,\nit'll cause me no end of trouble.
I suppose it's fine if you contact them\nonce in a while.\c\nI'm sure it'll make your folks happy.
That's all right. You're active--just like\na young person should be.\c\nDo your best!
Do you know people all over the world?\c\nI never would've imagined a world\nlike this when I was young.
When I was your age, the ladies\nused to get worked up over me. Ha ha!
Recently, it looks like there have been\nlots of global Trainers like you.
It feels like since you started coming,\nUnity Tower has gotten busier.\c\nKeep up the good work!
I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting\npretty full, then?\c\nWell, that's really something.
Unity Tower is as lively as ever\nwith people who come here to see you.\c\nWell, hope you enjoy yourself today.
How in the world did you manage to trade\nwith so many different places?
You must know a lot of people in\ndifferent places in the world.\c\nHa ha. Even if you go on a trip, no\nworries about not knowing anyone, huh?
I've been a guard for 30 years.\nToday, all is well, too.\r\nMmm... That's great!
I think I'll try buying that new gum\nnext time.
When I see you, I suddenly feel very\nsure that the future will be full of hope.
When you visit, Unity Tower gets exciting!\c\nThink of this place as your own backyard\nand feel free to go where you please.

Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nYou get a Pokémon yet?\c\nThere aren't any Pokémon Trainers\naround here, and I'm getting bored!\c
What's that?\c\n...\c
A person named Bianca is\ngiving you a Pokémon? Really?!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIf you get a Pokémon,\ntake really, really good care of it, OK?\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yeah...\c
OK! Let's go get your Pokémon!\c\nThere's something I have to do!\c\nAnd to do that, I need someone\nI can trust besides my partner Pokémon.\r\nA person I can trust!\c\nThat's right! I'm talking about you!\nYou seem like you've got good instincts!\c
You head on home.\c
OK, big brother!\c\nBye-bye, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: All riiight!\nLet's go find that person named Bianca!
                         
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Still...\c\nYou're really lucky to get a Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Once you get a Pokémon,\nyou leave on a journey right away.\c\nWhen you do that, I'm gonna have you\nhelp me out!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hurry up already!\nLet's look for that Bianca person!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\c\nI was just in the Pokémon Center,\nand there wasn't anyone like that there.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The Trainers' School\nwas just finished!\c\nNo one is allowed inside until a\nTeacher, or better said, a Gym Leader,\r\nstarts working there!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That goes to Route 19.\c\nIf we don't find Bianca here in town,\nI'll go check it for you!\c\n'Cause I already have a Pokémon!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, I get it!\c\nThe outlook is Aspertia's\nmost famous spot!\c\nI'll bet Bianca is up there\nlooking at the scenery!\c\nC'mon!\nGo get your Pokémon already!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Listen, there's no way\nI got this wrong!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Listen, there's no way\nI got this wrong!\c
???: It's sooo pretty!\c
Hey there!\nDon't you agree?\c
Oh!\nMy name is Bianca!\c\nI'm the assistant of the\nPokémon Professor--Professor Juniper.\c\nBy the way, I'm looking for someone.\nDo you know a person named [VAR 0100(0000)]?
Oh, wait!\nYou're [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWooow! You're ex-act-ly like\nwhat I heard!\c
Oh, wait!\nYou're [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWooow! You're ex-act-ly like\nwhat I heard!\c
                                           
Bianca: Nice to meet you!\c\nI have a really important request\nto ask you!\c\nWill you help us complete\nthe Pokédex?
Oh, wow, thanks!\c\nYour support will help Professor\nJuniper's research move forward!\c\nAnyway, filling up the\nPokédex is totally fun!
N-no way...\c\nI-I must have misheard you.\nRight?\c\nThis is a very important request.\c\nWill you please help us complete\nthe Pokédex?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: See!\nBianca was here, right?\c\nNow, c'mon!\nGo and get your Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: See!\nBianca was here, right?\c\nNow, c'mon!\nGo and get your Pokémon!\c
Bianca: OK, then!\c\nTa-daaa!\c\nIn here is the Pokémon\nthat will be your partner!\c
                                              
                                             
                                             
[VAR BD02]The Water-type Pokémon\n[VAR BD02][VAR 0101(0001)]
[VAR BD02]The Fire-type Pokémon\n[VAR BD02][VAR 0101(0001)]
[VAR BD02]The Grass-type Pokémon\n[VAR BD02][VAR 0101(0001)]
Choose a Pokémon.
Is this the Pokémon you want?
Pick this one!
YES
NO
[VAR 0100(0000)] chose [VAR 0101(0001)]!
Bianca: Oh, wow! You and [VAR 0101(0002)]\nare a perfect match!\c\nBy the way, would you like to give\na nickname to the Pokémon you chose?
Bianca: Oh, OK, gotcha.\nYou're not going to give it a nickname.\c
Bianca: [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nIs that the nickname you want?
Bianca: [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nThat is such a great name!\c
Bianca: Now you've got your Pokémon,\nso I'll give you this, too--a Pokédex!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\nthe [VAR FF00(0002)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Bianca: You want to know what it does?\c\nThe Pokédex is a high-tech device\nthat automatically records the\r\nPokémon you encounter!\c\nSo Professor Juniper wants you to carry\nthis Pokédex, visit a lot of places, and\r\nmeet all the Pokémon in the Unova region!
Still, that Professor Juniper!\c\nThe normal thing to do is to\nget an OK before sending\r\nsomeone clear out here, right?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Heeey! How long are you\nplanning on keeping me waiting, anyway?\c\nHey! What's that?\c
So that's your partner, huh?\c\nThat's great!\c\nMy sister already said so, but\ntake really, really good care\r\nof your Pokémon! Got it?\c\nWhat's that you're holding there?\c
Bianca: It's a Pokédex!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please give me\na Pokédex, too!\c\nI want to get stronger!\c\nIf I have a Pokédex,\nI can learn more about Pokémon...\r\nThat'll make me tougher, right?\c
Bianca: Um...who are you again?\c
I'm [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI'm going to travel the Unova region\nwith my Pokémon partner in order\r\nto search for something very important!\c
Bianca: Well, OK!\c\nI don't really get it, but going\non a journey is always good!\c\nAnyway, I just happen to have\nanother Pokédex on me!\c\nIt looks like Pokémon distribution has\nreally changed compared to two years\r\nago, so the more, the merrier!\c
Bianca: Ooh, I thought of something cool!\c\nYou both have Pokémon, right?\nWhy don't you have a Pokémon battle?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Let's see how good\na Trainer you are!\c\nI'll use my [VAR 0101(0003)]\nthat I raised from an Egg!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I lost...\nThis is different than battling\r\nwith wild Pokémon!\c\nWell, whatever.\nI'm just happy to know you're\r\na Trainer I can count on!\c\nCool. I'm heading off first!\nGet stronger!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That was good enough\nfor your first battle!\c\nCool. I'm heading off first!\nGet stronger!\c
Bianca: The Pokémon on both\nsides did their best!\c\nBut this little one is still weak,\nso battle with it and make it stronger!\c
All righty, let's go make your Pokémon\nbetter at the Pokémon Center!\c\nIt's like the best place ever for\nPokémon who battle and get hurt!\c
Bianca: The Pokémon Center is the\nsame no matter where you are!\c\nLet's go inside!\c
Mom: Oh! Nice to meet you!\nYou must be Bianca, right?\c\nAnd [VAR 0100(0000)] picked\n[VAR 0101(0002)], then!\c\nHee hee.\nLooking good!\c
Oh!\nI almost forgot!\c\nHere! Take these!\nThey're Running Shoes!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received\na pair of [VAR FF00(0002)]Running Shoes[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Mom: A perfect fit!\nI'll read the instructions to you!\c\n“Hold the B Button to run faster than\nnormal. Put on the Running Shoes and\r\nrace around to your heart's content!"\c\nNow, you and [VAR 0101(0002)] can\nrun anywhere you want!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: Um...\nThis is from me!\c
                           
Bianca: Why are there\ntwo Town Maps?\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: I want you to\ngive the other one to my big brother!\c
Mom: That's a good idea! Even if it is\na single road to the ocean, having a\r\nTown Map is always nice.\c\nI mean, if you use a Town Map,\nyou'll know all about what the\r\nUnova region is like!\c
Bianca: Aww, you guys!\nJust watching this makes me happy!\c\nC'mon, we're headed for Route 19!\nI'll teach you how to catch a Pokémon!\c
Mom: Bon voyage!\c\nTake [VAR 0101(0002)] and go see\nmany different Pokémon and\r\npeople with your own eyes!
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: Get along\nwith your Pokémon!
Bianca: Heeey!\c
Bianca: Yoo-hoo!\c
How was it?\nHow did your Pokémon battle with\r\nthe Gym Leader go?\c\nOh! If it isn't the Basic Badge!\c\nWow! Amazing! And you just set off\non your journey with your Pokémon!\c\nYou definitely have potential\nas a Trainer! I'm sure of it!\c\nThis is from me!\nIt's the TM for the move Return.\c
When a Pokémon knows Return,\nthe more it gets along with the Trainer,\r\nthe more powerful the move is!\c
Still, that Cheren...\c
Cheren: Bianca!\c\nIt's been two years, hasn't it?\c
Bianca: Oh wow!\c
Wh-what's up?\c
Cheren: I thought it would be a\ngood idea to register each other\r\nin the Xtransceiver!\c
Now, you can communicate\nwith me from your Xtransceiver.\c
Bianca: M-me, too!\c
I registered Professor Juniper\nfor you, too!\c
The Xtransceiver is ringing!
[VAR 0100(0000)] picked up the\nXtransceiver!\c
Bianca: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIsn't Professor Juniper cool?\c\nIf you talk to her on the Xtransceiver,\nshe'll evaluate the completeness\r\nof your Pokédex or tell you a lot about\r\nhow Pokémon evolve!\c\nAnd you can call us, too, of course!\c
I'll tell you how well\nyou and your Pokémon\r\nare getting along, OK?!\c
Cheren: Bianca makes a good point.\c\nI'll tell you what I know about Pokémon\nAbilities and Pokémon type matchups.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you the Gym Leader?\nOne, two, three--let's battle!\c
Cheren: You look like a tough Trainer.\c\nUnderstood.\nPlease come into my Pokémon Gym!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What was that weak answer?!\nI'm definitely going to take you down!\c
Bianca: Being a Gym Leader\nis even harder than I imagined.\c
The next thing is to make it so you\ncan use the C-Gear.\c\nThe C-Gear is a cool device for\ncommunications, such as Infrared\r\nConnection or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] obtained\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]C-Gear[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Turn on the C-Gear and\nestablish communications?
YES
NO
Some functions of the C-Gear\nwill be restricted. Is that OK?
Wireless communications\nare turned OFF.\c\nTurn wireless communications\nON in the System Settings.\r\nError code: 50699\c
Check this! The C-Gear was activated,\nand that screen showed up!\c\nIf you touch the “?" icon in the\nbottom-right corner of the\r\nC-Gear screen, you can read about\r\nthe C-Gear.\c\nLike, what are you going to do now?\nYou know, there's another Pokémon Gym\r\nin Virbank City, which is just past\r\nFloccesy Town.
If you want to turn on the C-Gear, touch\nthe Power symbol at the bottom right of\r\nthe C-Gear screen.\c\nThen, after turning on the power,\nif you touch the “?" icon in the\r\nbottom-right corner of the\r\nC-Gear screen, you can read about\r\nthe C-Gear.\c\nLike, what are you going to do now?\nYou know, there's another Pokémon Gym\r\nin Virbank City, which is just past\r\nFloccesy Town.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey! My sis has something\nshe wants to tell you!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: Um...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nMy Purrloin...\c\nIt evolved, but thank you\nvery much for finding it!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: There's more, right?\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]'s Sister: Um...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nThese days, I've been having\ndreams about a Pokémon.\r\nA Pokémon called Zoroark.\c\nIt was calling your name, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't really get it,\nbut I hear that the Zoroark from her\r\ndreams is on Victory Road!\c\nThat's what she wanted to say.\nBe seeing you!\c
Oh! Almost forgot.\c\nCongrats on becoming the Champion!\c\nI called it!\nYou've got good instincts!\c
Trainers are the ones who\nhave their Pokémon partners battle.\c\nI hear Gym Leaders are\nreally strong Trainers!
So about the Gym Leader Cheren...\c\nA few years ago he traveled all over\nthe Unova region with his Pokémon.
I wish the Trainers' School\nwould hurry up and open!\c\nThere's so much about\nPokémon I want to know!
I know lots about Pokémon!\c\n'Cause I learned so much\nat the Trainers' School!
The view of Route 19\nfrom the outlook is\r\nAspertia City's pride and joy.
The power of science is amazing!\c\nNow you can use communications\nto play with a hundred people\r\nat the same time!
People go on journeys and become adults.\nMaybe I should leave this city, too...
Sometimes wild Pokémon attack people!\c\nBut the ones you befriend, the ones that\nstay by your side, are Pokémon, too!
Your mom's really good at\ngetting Pokémon to rest\r\nand making them feel better!
Oh, hi!\c\nWhy, Aurea Juniper!\c\nIt's been far too long!\nWhat can I do for you?\c\n...\c\nWow! A Pokédex...\nFor my child?\c\nWhy, that's great! I think a journey\nwould be a wonderful experience!\c
What now? She's already here?\c\nOh, for Pete's sake.\nYou never change.\c\nOnce you've decided on something,\nyou just start going.\c\nOK! Bianca, right?\nA big, green hat. Got it.\c\nOK!\nNo worries!\c
This is Aspertia City.\nA city that reaches for the sky.

???: You must be a challenger!\c
Welcome to Aspertia City's Pokémon Gym.\c\nI'm Cheren, the Gym Leader!\c\nHm? Well, maybe I'd better say that I\njust became the Gym Leader!\c\nMore importantly, we need to prepare\nbefore welcoming you to the Gym.\c
We have a challenger!\nYou two, take your places!\c
If you can defeat these two,\nthen I'll be your opponent!
If you want to battle me,\nplease defeat those two first, OK?
Just as this is your first Gym challenge,\nthis is my first Pokémon battle\r\nas a Gym Leader!\c\nLet's both do our best and have\na battle we can be proud of!\c
That battle has made me feel really\nglad you were my first challenger\r\nas a Gym Leader...\c\nI give you this in honor of the strength\nyou and your Pokémon showed!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] received the\nBasic Badge from Cheren!\c
Here is your first Gym Badge,\nthe Basic Badge!\r\nThis is an important milestone!\c\nWith this Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 20\nwill obey you, including traded Pokémon.\c\nAnd I want you to take this!\c
TM83 can teach your\nPokémon the move Work Up!\c\nWhen you use Work Up\nwhile battling, it raises\r\nthe user's Attack and Sp. Atk.\c\nBy the way, TMs can be used\nas many times as you want!\c
In the Unova region, there are eight\nPokémon Gyms and eight Gym Badges!\c\nIf you're a Trainer,\nyou could collect all of them!\c\nThat will make it easier to fill\nthe pages of the Pokédex as well!\c\nYes, two years ago, Pokédex in hand,\nI left on a journey with my friends.
Cheren: You should decide what\nyou're going to do from here out!\c\nDon't worry about losing your way--\nyou have Pokémon by your side!
Cheren saw potential in me and\nmade me a Trainer in this Gym!\c
If you can defeat the girl, too,\nyou can challenge the Gym Leader!
Wow! You can challenge\nthe Gym Leader!
The reason Cheren saw potential\nin me was there was no one else...?\c\nNo way! Even if that is the case,\nI just have to get stronger!
Now I'll show you all of the\nthings I learned from Cheren!\c
I guess you can battle a little!\nThink you can beat the other Trainer?
OK. You're pretty good!\nBut, can you beat Cheren?
I have to learn even more\nabout my Pokémon!
Hello! I'm Clyde, the guide for Trainers\nwho challenge Pokémon Gyms.\c\nThank you for taking on the Gym!\nTake this to commemorate\r\nyour debut!\c
Pokémon Gyms are facilities\nfor testing Trainers' abilities!\c\nPut simply, if you can defeat\nthe Gym Leader, it means\r\nyou're a really good Trainer!\c
If you run out of Pokémon that can fight\nduring a Pokémon battle, you lose!\c\nSo having a lot of Pokémon with you\nmight work to your advantage!
I hope you'll remember the wonderful\nmoment in which you received\r\nthat Badge forever.

The Pokémon Center heals\nPokémon for free!\c\nYou should bring your Pokémon here\nanytime they are weak.\c
I'll heal your Pokémon.\nHand me your Poké Ball for a sec!\c
Next, I'll explain the PC!\c
This square thing is a PC!\nAny Trainer is free to use it!\c\nYou can deposit Pokémon in it.\c\nAlso, you can withdraw\nPokémon from it!\c
The next thing is over here!\c
This is the Poké Mart!\c\nHere you can buy and\nsell many different items!\c\nThe Poké Balls you use\nto catch Pokémon can also\r\nbe bought at the Poké Mart!\c
Here, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI'll give you some Poké Balls!\c
Here, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI'll give you some Poké Balls!\c

Do you know Professor Juniper?\nShe's a famous Pokémon researcher.\c\nActually, she's an old friend of mine,\nand she called me today for the\r\nfirst time in ages!\c
This is out of the blue,\nbut, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDo you want to have a Pokémon?
I'll ask you again.\c\nDo you want a Pokémon?
What?!\nThat's a shock!\c
OK!\nStep one completed!\c\nWell then, do you know what a\nPokédex is?
I knew you would!\c\nIsn't it amazing how it automatically\nrecords Pokémon you encounter?\c
I see...\c\nIt's an amazing device that automatically\nrecords the Pokémon you encounter!\c
Yet another question!\c\nYou want a Pokédex, right?
OK!\nStep two completed!\c
I don't mean to be selfish, but I'd like it\nif you were a bit more agreeable.\c\nHaving a Pokédex means\ntraveling around the world!\r\nThink about that for a second.\c\nSo I'll ask you again...\c\nYou want a Pokédex, right?
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYour course of action has been set!\c\nA girl named Bianca has come\nhere to meet you!\c\nShe's Professor Juniper's assistant.\nI was told to simply look for\r\na big, green hat!\c\nThat's right!

I'll send you off with these\nwords from “Adventure Rules."\r\n“The X Button is vitally important\r\nfor Trainers."\c\nOK! Off with you now!\nGo look for Bianca, OK!
The girl's name is Bianca. I was told\nyou should look for a big, green hat!\c\nShe might be lost because\nthis is her first time here.\r\nGo look for her!
Oh? Are the both of you\nout looking for Bianca?\c\nYou still haven't found her?\nLook for the big, green hat!
Bianca: I was just talking to your mom!\c\nShe told me an amazing\nstory about Professor Juniper!
Mom: Welcome back!\nHey, how are your Pokémon?\c\nWell, why don't you rest for a moment?\nNothing but hard work will wear you out!\c
Mom: Looking good!\c\nBoth you and your Pokémon\nseem raring to go!
Mom: The same step is a lot more\nwonderful if it's made while\r\nthinking about Pokémon!
Mom: When I was younger,\nI worked at Pokémon Centers\r\nall over the place!
Mom: I wish we knew how\nPokémon felt...
Mom: Seeing energetic Pokémon\nfills me up with energy, too!\c\nIt reminds me of when I used\nto work in the Pokémon Center!
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nSeems like you've had a rough time.\r\nRest here awhile.\c\n...\c
Mom: OK! You and your Pokémon\nare full of energy!\c\nThis is a little advice from\nyour mother!\c\nWhen your Pokémon's stamina,\nI mean HP, goes down,\r\nheal them regularly at the\r\nPokémon Center!\c\nIf you're going on a long adventure,\nstock up on Potions\r\nat the Poké Mart!\c\nI'm cheering for you!\nHave a wonderful journey!
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Hmm. I barely recognize you!\c\nIt seems like you've seen\nand thought about a lot\r\nand grown into an adult!\c\nOh! Seems we're about to have\na visitor!\c

Cedric Juniper: Has it been that long?\nI can't remember...\c\nWell, that's not really why I came.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTo commemorate your entering the\nHall of Fame, I'm going to upgrade\r\nyour Pokédex!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]'s Pokédex\nwas upgraded!
Cedric Juniper: I'll tell you what\nI upgraded, so why don't you ask?\c\nWell, actually, it's really simple!\c\nI made it so you can register\nall of the National Pokédex Pokémon.\c
Mom: Wow! That's amazing!\nThat must be why you and\r\nyour daughter are Pokémon Professors!\c
Cedric Juniper: Ha ha ha!\nFlattery won't get you anywhere!\c\nWell then, think I'd best\nbe taking my leave!\c
Listen up! There are still many, many\nPokémon in this world!\c\nSometimes Pokémon attack\neach other for food.\c\nSometimes they help one another.\nThey protect each other's places.\c\nI'd be happy if you think about things\nlike that while looking at the Pokédex.\c
Mom: He left...\c\nOh, that's right! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI have a present for you, too!\c
Mom: No matter what you do, your time\nis yours and your Pokémon's alone!\c\nSo decide what you want to do\nfor yourself and do it!\c\nI enjoy my own time\nin my own way, too!

The Cave of Being...\c\nI wonder where those three Pokémon--\nUxie, Mesprit, and Azelf--flew off to?\c\nUxie is a Pokémon that\nsymbolizes knowledge...\c\nIf you mention a place in Unova\nwhere knowledge is gathered,\r\nthe first thing that comes to mind\r\nis Nacrene City's museum...\c\nMesprit is the Pokémon that\npresides over emotion, right?\c\nCelestial Tower's bell stirs emotions...\c\nAnd Azelf is willpower...\c\nThe desire to see something through...\nWhat place could represent that?
Route 23's mysterious Pokémon...\c\nJust by being near it you can feel\nsome kind of willpower...\c\nIt's best to go have a look\nfor yourself!

Professor Juniper--I'm talking about\nAurea Juniper, mind you...\c\nShe's researching the origins of Pokémon!\c\nIt's interesting!\nAmong the Pokémon that exist now,\r\nthere were some that have been\r\naround from the past and some\r\nthat were discovered recently.\c\nBy the way, her dad is researching\nPokémon distribution and biology!

It's too bad. If you had a Pokémon\nwith you as well, you could compete\r\nwith [VAR 0100(0001)] and see who is the\r\nbetter Trainer!

It looks like my son found\nsomething important.\c\nIt's all because Pokémon--\nand you--were by his side!
Someday you will both go on a\njourney with your Pokémon, too!

Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Roost!\c\nRoost is a move that can restore HP!\c\nAlso, if a Flying-type Pokémon uses it,\nit won't be Flying type during the turn,\r\nwhich means the type matchup will change.\c\nA supereffective move will be an\nordinary move, or a move that would\r\notherwise have no effect will land on it.\c\nIt's a quite tricky move.
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Synthesis!\c\nSynthesis is a move that\ncan restore HP!\c\nWhen the sunlight is harsh,\nthe Pokémon can restore\r\na lot of HP.\c\nBut in rain, hail, or a sandstorm,\nthe Pokémon cannot restore\r\nHP very much.\c\nSo, watch out for the weather!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Heal Bell!\c\nHeal Bell can heal status conditions\nof allies.\c\nIt's a loving move to heal\nstatus conditions of all the\r\nparty Pokémon!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Tailwind!\c\nTailwind doubles the Speed\nof all party Pokémon the turn\r\nthe move is used and for the next\r\nthree turns.\c\nIf Pokémon can act before their\nopponents, they can have an upper hand!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Pain Split!\c\nPain Split adds the user's HP\nto the target's HP, divides it\r\nby two, and has the Pokémon share it.\c\nUse it when the target's HP is higher\nthan your Pokémon's HP.\c\nYou can reduce the opponent's HP\nwhile recovering your Pokémon's HP.

Pokéstar Studios Sound Stage\nNo public access!
This fake building is so\ndetailed it looks real.
It's filled with movie props\nfor shooting films.
This detailed model of the Royal Unova\nis a set for a movie.
It's a set for a movie.\c\nIt's a model of the Skyarrow Bridge\ndone to 1/144 scale.

The jumpsuit I'm wearing is an essential\npart of creating visual effects!\c\nIt may be cutting-edge technology,\nbut it's pretty embarrassing to wear!
Hey, ya got this, kid?\nWhat we mean by VFX\r\nis visual effects.\c\nIt's a technology that lets us\nuse computers to process images.\c\nIn Pokéstar Studios movies,\nthe effects are really important!
I'm the screenwriter!\c\nI write the scripts that become\nthe movie's stories.\c\nFeels like my head is packed\nwith nothing but stories.
I'm a big guy, but I work with\nsmall movie props.\c\nSometimes I even make\nthe items actors use or the\r\nfurniture on the sets!
Hello! I'm the cinematographer.\c\nWell, put more simply,\nI'm the cameraman.
Hey there! I'm the audio engineer!\c\nMy job is doing things like\nrecording the actor's lines.\c\nMost of Pokéstar Studios'\ndialog is dubbed in later, so right now,\r\nI have a bit of time on my hands!
C'mon... Where could it be?\c\nI'm going to get in trouble again\nif I can't find that megaphone!\c\nOh, do you work in films?\nI'm working as the AD.\c\nI guess you could call the\nAD the assistant director.

Heh heh heh...\c\nYou see, this is the dressing room\nfor an amazing beauty scouted\r\nfrom the something-or-other region.\c\nI wonder what's going on inside...
Whaugh! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThanks as always for your hard work!\nI'm putting my whole heart and soul\r\ninto my guard duty and making sure\r\nnot even a single Joltik will get through.
Only special stars approved\nby our boss are allowed into\r\nthis special dressing room.\c\nA brat like you has no business here.\nScram! Get out of here!
Good day!\nMr. Deeoh told me about it!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], please,\nenter the dressing room,\r\nand relax to your heart's content.
Pokéstar Studios movies are shot\nusing rental Pokémon, right?\c\nDoes this mean my little\nLillipup can't be in the movies?\c
If you shoot a movie with\nrental Pokémon once successfully,\r\nthen you can use your own Pokémon!\c\nThat's why me and my Stunfisk\nare shooting for the stars!\c\nRight, Stunfisk?
...
Welcome to the soundstage\nof Pokéstar Studios!\c\nOh... You're...\c\nI guess since I don't remember\nyour name, you must be new!
Welcome to the soundstage\nof Pokéstar Studios!\c\nOh... You're...\c\nYou've been coming in and out quite a\nbit recently! Are your movies good?\c\nHee hee! Maybe I should go see one!
Welcome to the soundstage\nof Pokéstar Studios!\c\nOh... You're...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], wasn't it?\nI hear your name around here\r\nquite often lately!\r\nTee hee! You're working hard, huh?
Welcome to the soundstage\nof Pokéstar Studios!\c\nOh...\nHello, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWhen we release your films,\nthe whole theater fills up!\c\nTee hee hee! At some point you\njoined the ranks of the big stars, huh?
Welcome to the soundstage\nof Pokéstar Studios!\c\nOh...\nHello, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nTee hee hee...\c\nI never would've imagined you\nwould become this famous...
Hi! You're new, right?\c\nListen up! If you're an actor,\nmake sure to check the script!\c\nWork hard and try to be\na big star like Brycen!
Hey! You're [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nI've been hearing your name\nhere and there recently.\r\nSo apparently they're making\r\nscripts with you in mind now, aren't they?
Why, if it isn't [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou're quite popular now, too!\c\nThe Pokéstar Studios staff is\nreally proud you're on our team!
I'm the VFX specialist!\c\nYou've seen those green screens\nin the soundstage, right?\c\nImages filmed in front of them\nare turned into impressive\r\nmovies using computers!
Hey! Want to know anything\nabout Pokéstar Studios?
Pokéstar Studios films are shot\nwhile following a script!\c\nIn other words, the script\nis the foundation the rest\r\nof the movie is built on!\c\nDirections for making\nfilming work and information\r\nabout the other actors is\r\nalso written in the script!\c\nYou can look at it while shooting,\nso check it if you're in trouble!\c\nThe scripts you can shoot increase\ndepending on things like the\r\ncontent of the movies you've made\r\nor how much they've grossed!\c
Pokémon are an indispensable part\nof moviemaking at Pokéstar Studios!\c\nThe actor and the Pokémon's acting\nare what make a shoot proceed.\c\nAt first we have you rent Pokémon\nfor each different script.\c\nOnce you can make a good film,\nyou'll be able to shoot it again\r\nwith your own Pokémon!\c
The basics of Pokéstar Studios film\nacting resemble Pokémon battling.\c\nBut it's not a battle, so winning\nisn't always important!\c\nHints about what to do are written\nin the script, so check it carefully.\c\nThe director's comments can also\nbe helpful!\c
As the shoot goes on,\nyou can pick lines!\c\nChoose the line that makes you\nthink, “This is great!"\c\nThe lines you choose will change\nyour costars' acting and the story\r\nof the final film itself!\c
As you make movies and they\nare played in the theater,\r\nyou'll become popular!\c\nIf you become popular,\nI'm sure some good things will happen!\c
OK! Do your best!

I'm fine!
Pokémon 2
At Pokéstar Studios, any Pokémon\ncan participate in the filming!\c\nBut you need to pay attention\nto the moves it knows.\c\nIf a Pokémon knows any of these moves,\nit can't be in a movie:\r\nTransform,\r\nTorment,\r\nor Metronome.\c\nThese moves get in your costars' way,\nso they're banned at Pokéstar Studios.\c\nKeep this in mind when filming\nwith your own Pokémon!\c

[VAR 013A(0000)]!\nDo you have any questions?
This is the brand-new avenue in the\nUnova region, [VAR 0139(0001)]!\c\nIt is still under major development\nto create an avenue that's perfect for\r\nmeeting people, making discoveries,\r\nand having fun. Good times!\c
[VAR 013A(0000)], you've been signed up\nby the owner to manage the avenue.\c\nYour goal is simple:\ncreate a dazzling, delightful avenue!\c\nDesign an avenue that will fill all visitors\nwith joy and the desire to visit often.\c\nYou'll have assistants, so please let us\nknow how we can help you.\c
You can use various communication\nfeatures to encourage people to visit.\c\nTalk to people during their visits here.\nThere are two things you can do.\c\nThe first thing is to “invite" someone.\nThe other thing is to “recommend" a shop\r\nto someone.\c\nTo really get the idea of all you can do,\nstay and listen to a little more about it.\c
You can bring in more customers by\nusing the communication features.\c\nWhen you have the C-Gear turned on,\npassersby will visit the avenue.\c\nPeople you've met through the Union\nRoom, Infrared Communication, Random\r\nMatchups, and GTS visit the avenue, too.\c\nCommunication features aren't the\nonly way to bring in visitors.\c\nAs your adventure progresses,\nfans might sometimes visit the avenue.\c\nYou can use your Town Map to check\nthe current number of visitors.\c\nIt might be fun to check it now and then.\c
When you select “Invite," the visitor\nwill begin to live here and create a shop.\c\nEach person has his or her own\nhopes and dreams.\c\nI recommend listening carefully to the\nperson before you decide.\c
“Recommend" a shop to a visitor.\c\nIf the visitor is happy with the shop,\nthe popularity of the shop and\r\nthis avenue will go up.\c\nAs their popularity goes up, shops and\nthis avenue reach higher ranks.\c\nThe higher the shop rank goes up,\nthe more items and services it'll have.\c\nWhen the current avenue rank goes up,\nitem prices will become slightly\r\nmore reasonable.\c\nTry to recommend shops that your\nvisitors will be delighted with so the\r\npopularity of the shops goes up!\c
[VAR 013A(0000)], this is your office.\c\nYour assistants and I will support you\nin developing [VAR 0139(0001)].\c\nAs the avenue grows bigger and bigger,\nthere will be more and more visitors.\c\nYou may enjoy hearing what they have to\nsay, so please drop by from time to time.\c
At Markets, you'll be able to purchase\nvarious items useful for your adventure.\c\nSometimes they carry items not available\nat Poké Marts, or so I've heard.\c
At Raffle Shops, you can win cool prizes.\c\nThe grand prize is a Master Ball!\c
Flower Shops carry Berries.\c\nDifferent shops may have\ndifferent Berries.\c
At Nurseries, you can put Pokémon Eggs\nin incubators to speed up hatching.\c
Dojos train Pokémon.\c\nThey can level up Pokémon and\nraise the base stats of Pokémon.\c\nBe aware that Pokémon won't learn\ncertain moves or evolve while they\r\nlevel up this way.\c
Antique Shops carry rare finds.\c\nYou may find out you have really rare\nitems when you have them appraised.\c
Cafés give you and your Pokémon\nthe chance to have a nice meal.\c\nMeals make Pokémon happy,\nand they will grow friendly faster.\c\nYou can also level Pokémon up and\nraise their base stats.\c\nBe aware that Pokémon won't learn\ncertain moves or evolve while they\r\nlevel up this way.\c
Beauty Salons keep Pokémon tidy.\c\nHaircuts and cosmetics make Pokémon\nhappy, and they grow friendlier faster.\c
There are seven different kinds of shops\nthat can be built in [VAR 0139(0000)].\c\nWhen someone is invited to build a shop,\nthe type of shop they open is based\r\non that person's hopes and dreams.\c\nWhen you recommend shops to visitors,\nthe shops get more popular and their\r\nrank improves.\c\nTalk to assistant 2 for advice on what\nkinds of shops will grow the fastest.\c
There are eight different kinds of shops\nyou can build in [VAR 0139(0000)].\c\nWhen someone is invited to build a shop,\nthe type of shop they open is based\r\non that person's hopes and dreams.\c\nWhen you recommend shops to visitors,\nthe shops get more popular and their\r\nrank improves.\c\nTalk to assistant 2 for advice on what\nkinds of shops will grow the fastest.\c
Is there anything you'd like to know\nabout shops?
I'm looking forward to seeing this grow\ninto a fantastic avenue!
Bring in more customers by using\nthe communication features.\c\nPeople you've met through communication\nfeatures will visit the avenue.\c\nWhen you talk to them, there are three\nthings you can choose to do.\c\nYou can “invite" the person to join\nthe avenue, “recommend" a shop, or\r\n“recruit" that person as an assistant.\c\nFor details, please listen to\neach explanation.\c
If you choose to “Recruit," the visitor\nwill become your assistant and help you.\c\nYour chances of recruiting the visitor\nimprove if your avenue ranks higher\r\nthan the person's ideals.\c

Cheren: Hey, nice timing!\c\nI heard that Team Plasma was seen\nin Pinwheel Forest...\c\nCould you help me look for them?
We don't know how many there are,\nso splitting up doesn't seem like\r\na very good tactic.\c\nGot it! I'll wait here until\nyou're ready to go!\c
Thank you!\c\nThis is a good opportunity for me\nto see up close what you can really do.\r\nI suppose I'll follow your lead.\c\nLeave recovery to me!\c
Cheren: Stop!\c\nIf you go past here, we'll leave\nthe Pinwheel Forest.\c\nWe still haven't found Team Plasma,\nbut do you need to leave for a minute?
Cheren: Team Plasma was seen inside\nPinwheel Forest...\c\nBut you already know that.\nWill you help me look for them?
People and Pokémon\neach have their own strengths--\r\nthe strength to realize dreams,\r\nand the strength to protect others...\c\nI'm sure N understands that now.
Team Plasma...\nOr better said, Ghetsis...\c\nIt's almost like, to him, there was\nnothing else in the world but himself...
My ideal is to be strong...\c\nBut there are many ways to be strong\nin this world.\c\nSimply winning battles doesn't help\nme find the ideal strength I desire.
You remind me of a friend of mine\nwhose strength was amazing.\c\nI wonder what that friend\nis up to these days...
Still no sign of Team Plasma. Why don't we\nhead deeper into the forest?
                                                                                            
                                                                            
Gorm: Boo!\c
I am Gorm. I was once one\nof Team Plasma's Seven Sages.\c
Cheren: Team Plasma's finished.\c\nDespite that, you still haven't given up?\nAre you here planning something?\c
Gorm: Wait one moment!\nI have no plans to confront you.\c\nI don't mean to disappoint you,\nbut I doubt I'm a match for either\r\nof you in the first place...\c\nHm?\nWhat happened to your glasses?\c\nExcuse me, but that's not important.\c\nI learned of my old ally's recklessness,\nand I had come here to admonish him...\c\nBut the matter had already been\nresolved, and this place made me think...\c\nWhat did we believe in that made\nus try to steal the Dragon Skull?\c
A man who has committed a mistake\nand doesn't correct it\r\nis committing another mistake.\c\nDo you understand what this means?\c\nAvoiding all mistakes is impossible,\nbut not fixing mistakes you've made--\r\nthat is truly foolish.\c\nThat being said, this doesn't\nreally concern you, does it?\c\nWell then, Trainers, may you and your\nPokémon be well.\c
Cheren: You know...\c\nIf it wasn't for Ghetsis,\nhe might've chosen another path...\c\nOr maybe not. He was the one who\ndecided to follow Ghetsis, after all...\c
That aside, thank you!\c\nYour help made this\ninvestigation go smoothly.\c\nThis is my thanks!\nCome on, just take it!\c
OK! Be seeing you!\c
I'm going to do a lap around Unova\nclockwise from Nimbasa City\r\nwithout healing my Pokémon!\c\nIt's the Unova Spartan Marathon,\nand next time, I'm going to race!
We're thinning trees to\nprotect the forest.\c\nThat's why we're having Pokémon\ncut down trees.\c\nWhen there are too many trees,\nthe whole forest gets weaker...\c\nThese trees are being cut down\nso the whole forest will thrive...
Ah, wouldn't it be nice if the Pokémon\nliving in the forest liked the sunbeams\r\nfiltering through the leaves, too!
Hi, Trainer.\c\nIf you have a Pokédex, could you show me\nyour Habitat List?\c\nI want to know about the Pokémon\nthat live in Pinwheel Forest.\c
You still have many meetings\nwaiting for you...\c\nTell me when you've encountered\nall of the Pokémon in Pinwheel Forest.
Perfect!\nThis is my thanks!\c
Finding the Pokémon that can\nonly be found in the rustling grass\r\nis really amazing!
The legendary Pokémon...\nIs it true it was really beyond here?
The surface is covered with moss.\nTouching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!\c\n\nA forest is likely to contain many\nwell-hidden items!\c\nThey may be hard to find,\nso look carefully!

This happened around when the hero\nappeared in Opelucid City with the\r\nlegendary dragon Pokémon.\c
Right around here, you would\nhear a very sad cry.\c\nThen a bright-green Pokémon would\nrun around like the wind.\c
I've heard it's called Virizion, and it\ntook up against humans to protect\r\nPokémon from a war between people.\c\nIt's apparently a legendary Pokémon.\c\nMaybe it was afraid that Team Plasma's\nrising to power would ruin the world and\r\nits friends' homes would be destroyed.

If a Pokémon holds this Soft Sand, the\npower of its Ground-type moves goes up!
According to what I've heard, that\nRelic Castle is the ruins of a city built\r\nby the hero of old and the dragon\r\nPokémon that accompanied the hero.
Oh! A sea of sand! I don't need\nGo-Goggles here!\c\nThe Mirage Tower in a desert\nof the Hoenn region has disappeared.\c\nUnova's desert is also swallowing\nup the Relic Castle little by little.
An expansive desert and\na castle buried in sand!\c\nThere's no doubt about it!\nTreasure is here!\c\nIt's been a year since the day my\ninternal treasure detector went off,\r\nbut I still haven't found any yet.\r\nI'm still following my dream, though...\c\nAnd I'm having so much fun\nI can barely stand it!\c

I'm a School Kid, and I'll tell you this.\c\nJust like in caves, you can run into\nPokémon almost anywhere in the desert.\c\nBut they don't like hiding in the pale\nsand. So if you walk there, you won't\r\nhave to worry about battling.

Whaddya think?\nGreat buildin', huh?\c\nHere's where the Pokémon World\nTournament takes place!\r\nAin't she purty?\c\nFollow me, tads!\c
Cheren: I barely recognized\nyou and [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou two are way different from when\nwe battled in Aspertia City!\c\nTraveling with Pokémon makes\neveryone grow so much...\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What was that just now?!\c
I'm going after him!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], come with me!\c
Stop.\c
Colress: There's no reason\nfor you to stick your necks into\r\nsomething so dangerous!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The Pokémon I'm looking\nfor--my little sister's Purrloin--it\r\nmight be with them!\c
Cheren: I'm going, too!\c\nI've got his back!\c
Colress: I don't understand.\nThat's not courage, it's recklessness!\c\nDoes he think anything is possible simply\nbecause he has Pokémon with him?\c\nNo, no...\nThat's not possible.\c\nAll Trainers and Pokémon are bound\nto one another by Poké Balls...\c\nThen maybe it is this bond that will allow\nTrainers to overcome the impossible if\r\nthey trust their partner Pokémon.\c
Colress: Trust...\nIt's too much of an unknown factor.\c\nBut if believing in your Pokémon\ngives you the courage to stand up\r\nto Team Plasma...\c\nAnd the courage to help your friends...\c\nThen follow them south to the dock!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The Shadow Triad?\nWhat's their deal, anyway!\c\nAAAAH!\nTeam Plasma! Where did you vanish to!\c
Cheren: The Shadow Triad...\c\nWith their superhuman powers, they\ncan immobilize people and then disappear!\c\nBut I'm more concerned with what\nZinzolin said...\c\n“Once again, we will use the\nlegendary Dragon-type Pokémon\r\nand we will rule the Unova region!"\r\nWhat could that mean?\c\nThe legendary Dragon-type Pokémon\nReshiram and Zekrom\r\naren't in Unova anymore...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThere's something I want to look into,\nso I'm going to head to Route 6!\c\nBe careful out there!\c
A helmet is an important tool for\nshock protection!\c\nIt's good to let your Pokémon\nhave one, too!\c
If you let a Pokémon hold a Rocky Helmet,\nthe foe will also be damaged if that foe's\r\nmove makes physical contact.
       
Water Pledge,\nFire Pledge,\r\nand Grass Pledge.\c\nWhen combinations of these\nthree moves are used in battle,\r\nspecial things happen!
       
       
       
My husband can teach some Pokémon the\nultimate moves! I'll tell you their names.\c\nThe blazing Fire-type Pokémon:\nCharizard, Typhlosion, Blaziken,\r\nInfernape, and Emboar!\c\nThe restless Water-type Pokémon:\nBlastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert,\r\nEmpoleon, and Samurott!\c\nThe quiet Grass-type Pokémon:\nVenusaur, Meganium, Sceptile,\r\nTorterra, and Serperior!
What kind of Trainers will come?\nWhat kind of battle will it be?
When battling in front of people,\nit's well known that you should stand\r\nyour ground and not dance around.\c\nBut I can't resist moves that groove,\nlike Petal Dance, Quiver Dance,\r\nFiery Dance, and Dragon Dance.\c\nAnd on rare occasions, even Lunar Dance!
The crowd will go wild for my Pokémon!
Isn't it wonderful how people\nchallenging themselves helps\r\nbring the world together!
When a Pokémon learns the move\nHidden Power, somehow I can tell\r\nwhat type that move will be!\c\nShould I tell you what type of\nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power,\nI can tell you what type of Hidden Power\r\nyour Pokémon will learn!\r\nDo you want to know?
If this Pokémon were to learn\nHidden Power, the move's type\r\nwould be [VAR 0103(0000)]!
The type of this Pokémon's\nHidden Power is [VAR 0103(0000)]!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll\nactivate my hidden power for you!
It's not possible for an Egg to use\nHidden Power!
I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn\nto use Hidden Power.
That cave down there\nis the Relic Passage!\c\nIt was recently discovered,\nbut amazingly, it's...\c\nWait? Where was it\nconnected to again?
A ship's only really a ship when\nit's crossing an ocean.\r\nDocked ships sure look lonely.

Clay: This time, I'm gonna have ya\nparticipate in the Driftveil Tournament.\c\nAnything goes in this here tournament!\c\nEight people will be participatin', and if\nya win three times, yer the champion!\c
Cheren: Why did you call me, too?\nI'm busy looking into something!\c
Clay: Ya know somethin', Cheren.\nThe one who's gotta show everyone\r\nwhat Pokémon battlin' means--is you.\c\nAnd yer pal ain't here, either!\c\nI'm countin' on the power of youth,\n'cause everyone likes\r\nup-and-comin' stars!\c\nOK! Whenever yer ready,\nget on over to reception!\c
Clay: Whenever yer ready,\nget on over to reception!
Cheren: Man oh man...\nYou never change, Clay.\c\nBut the tournament itself\ndoes look pretty fun!\c\nOK!\nI'll go register!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Me, too!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]. C'mon! Let's have some fun.\nWe'll battle, plain and simple!\c
Clay: An outstandin' battle, runts!\c\nNow everybody's gonna want to\njoin in on this here tournament\r\nan' show their stuff!\c
Roxie: Hey! You two!\c\nHaven't you got any wild and crazy\nPokémon battles to show me?!\c\nGuess I'll have to enter the\ntournament myself and rock the\r\naudience right outta their seats!\c
Clay: See what I mean?\nPeople are pourin' in already!\c\nIf the strongest Trainers from\nall over join in, it'll raise up\r\neverybody's level of skill!\c\nAn' then, li'l ol' Driftveil City\nwill grow even more and make\r\na heap of money!\c\nSo keep on bustin' those battles\nand rilin' everybody up! See ya!\c
Colress: By having battles with\nmany Trainers, I can bring out\r\nPokémon's abilities!\c\nEventually, as I continue to battle,\nthe truth of my theory\r\nwill be evident to all!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aww...\c\nI wanted to win the tournament\nthe first time I participated!
Cheren: The Unova Gym Leaders\nwill probably participate in order\r\nto improve their skills.
Someday, I'll be a famous guy!\c\nBut for now, I'm just a spectator here.
Many Trainers from far away will come\nto participate!
Clay is awesome!\c\nI heard he started all this to encourage\nDriftveil City's development!
Two years ago, this was\nthe Cold Storage area!
That's the Pokémon World Tournament\nfor you! It's packed with spectators!
It's crazy popular! This is what\npacked to the rafters means!
What can I do when\neverything's sold out?
It's the Pokémon World Tournament!\nIt's all in the name!\c\nTrainers have gathered\nfrom all over the world!
Hello there, Trainer.\nLet me fill you in about Battle Points.\c\nBattle Points, also known as BP, are\npoints you get for winning streaks in\r\neither Nimbasa City's Battle Subway\r\nor this tournament.\c\nWin a lot, save up lots of points, and\nyou can exchange them for useful items!

Heeey!\c
Hi there!\c
Bianca: Did you know this?\c\nIf you push the floating stones,\nthey move!\c
As always, this place is charged with\nlots of electricity that Pokémon like!\c\nThe electric charges react from one\nstone to another, so that's why\r\nthere are floating stones!\c\nYou can't push all of them, though.\c
Oh, that's right!\nI came here to research something!\c\nBe seeing you!\c
Bianca: The bridge fell apart,\nbut it's being fixed right now!
What could have happened?\nMaybe wild Pokémon ran into it.\c\nAt any rate, it's going to take some\ntime to fix. Go wait around Driftveil!

Well, I suppose you have\nmany battles ahead of you.\c\nPokémon battles as a Pokémon Trainer.\c\nBattles about how you\nshould live your life...\c\nYou'll lose sometimes,\nbut I think what matters\r\nis that you do things your own way.\c\nIf you surpass what you've done before,\nyou have bested yourself.

You know, N was so nice to Pokémon...\c\nAnd all I wanted to do was protect\nPokémon from bad people...\c

Oh, thank you.\nThat's so nice.\c\nEven if we said it was for Pokémon, in the\nend, we were doing what we wanted to do.\c\nPlease excuse me.\nThere's still something I have to do!\c

Walk a just path\nwith Pokémon!" and he flew the ship away.\r\nSo everything has been resolved.\c\nWe were even able to confirm\nthat Lord N is safe.

Rood!\nEx-Team Plasma!\c\nWhy do you have\nPokémon by your sides?\c
To protect what's important\nto you, right?\c\nEven if your precious Pokémon get hurt,\neven if your ideals are damaged,\r\nthe time to fight is NOW!\c
Team Plasma: You're just a kid!\nQuit trying to act so cool!\c\nWhatever! Nobody's getting\nclose to the Plasma Frigate!\r\nWipe them ALL out!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAs usual, take the other one!\c
Team Plasma: Like he said!\c\nWe're going to crush you\nalong with the traitors!\c\nBecause Team Plasma exists\nto cause trouble!\c
Rood: Are your Pokémon OK?\nYou should take these with you!\c
You, too.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thanks...\c
I'm passing through!\c\nOh, it looks like their backup\nhas arrived.\c
Rood: At times like these,\nthose whose hearts weaken,\r\nthose whose determination falters,\r\ncan accomplish nothing!\c\nTo save our old allies,\nto protect Unova,\r\nwe will fight!\c
Both of you, go!\c\nNo, just a moment...\n[VAR 0100(0001)], was it?\c\nAbout the Pokémon you're looking for...\nIn all likelihood, it is in the possession\r\nof the Shadow Triad--the dark warriors\r\nwho appear silently.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Got it!\c\nIf I rescue it, that helps you guys\nabsolve your guilt, doesn't it?\r\nGuess I'll help you out!\c
Rood: At that time, I believed\nwe were on the side of justice.\c\nBy serving my king, N,\nI was going to make a world without war.\c\nBut I was conceited, and I couldn't\nsee the unhappiness we were causing.\c\nThat's why I can't let it happen again!
Don't ignore Pokémon's feelings\nand separate them from their Trainers!
Is this where you come to an\nunderstanding by trading blows?\r\nThis is what being young is, right?
That traitorous Sage!\nI'm going to pound him into a pulp!
We're going to conquer Unova and\nmake all the Pokémon ours!\c\nThen our failure two years ago\nwon't matter anymore!
Oh! I can feel how strongly\nthis person feels!\r\nI-it's making me doubt myself!
I don't care about you at all!\n'Cause you can't beat our boss!\c\nI'll stay here and pound these traitors!
We're gonna freeze Unova solid\nand steal everyone's Pokémon!
That's what I would expect from\nsomeone who binds their Pokémon\r\nwith Poké Balls!
What you're doing now is nothing\nmore than a futile struggle!

Bazzazzazzash!
Preeeeaah!
Ghetsis: Excellent!\nThat was a moving expression\r\nof your determination!\c\nSo the education I provided\nto make you king wasn't\r\na complete waste, then!\c
But I still haven't forgotten that even\nthough I was kind enough to find you\r\nwhen you were living in the forest with\r\nPokémon, and take you in, and care\r\nfor you, in the end you were selfish\r\nand disrupted my plans.\c\nI was supposed to use your\nabilities to rule Unova!\c
But I'll forgive you for that as well.\c\nZekrom, which you were kind enough\nto bring with you, can shatter ice!\c\nNow you've saved me the work\nof searching for it!\c\nWell, actually, I knew you'd appear\nif we fired ice missiles into Opelucid City\r\nand you noticed the change!\c

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]That's an ugly formula!\nIt won't work![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Ghetsis: Oh, but it will!\c\nIf I use these!\c\nThe DNA Splicers!\c

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]...!\c\nI never would have believed that\nPokémon could fuse together...\r\nThat there was a formula like this...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
Ghetsis: You fool...\c\nLast time, I was going to use\nyou to capture people's hearts\r\nand minds to rule them!\c\nBut this time, I'm simply going to use\noverwhelming power and rule\r\nwith an iron fist!\c\nDo you understand?\nIf you had simply become king,\r\nUnova would have remained beautiful!\c
Come now, Trainer.\nThis time no one will save you!\c\nBut to make things interesting,\nI'll give you a chance.\c\nLet's see if you can stop\nTHIS Kyurem!\c
What's this?\nYour Poké Balls are trembling.\c\nCould your Pokémon\nbe shaking with rage?\c
No!\nThat's not possible!\c\nSimple tools don't have emotion\nor thought!\c\nCome!\nChallenge Kyurem!\c\nJust so you know,\ncatching it is impossible!\c\nMy cane emits signals that disrupt\nthe function of all Poké Balls!\c

Have you heard about this?\c\nA rich person was protecting\na Pokémon from bad people here!
I wonder how the Pokémon felt\nwhile it was in that room...\r\nIt must have been lonely for a long time.
The Victory Pokémon, Victini...\c\nThey say it can give its Trainer\nincredible power.\c\nI wonder who has access\nto that power now...
Th...that... Your Pokémon...\nIs that the Victory Pokémon, Victini?!\c\nIs it true?\nHave you just kept winning and winning\r\nwith Victini's help?\c\nI wish I had your luck...
Pokémon follow their Trainers'\norders without question.\c\nAnd yet, some people try\nto make Pokémon do bad things!
Nowadays, there aren't as many tourists\nvisiting here. It's boring...\c\nBut if the alternative is guys like\nTeam Plasma, I'm OK with being bored!
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich\nfamily bought this island.\nThey named it Liberty Garden.\n\nIt's a place where people and Pokémon\ncan live freely.
Dock 2\nTo board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light\nof freedom.\c\nOnly authorized personnel may enter.
Professor Juniper: Oh?\nVictini!\c
Professor Juniper: Oh?\nYour Pokédex...\c\nYou've caught Victini!\c
Professor Juniper: Oh?\nYour Pokédex...\c\nYou've seen Victini!\c
In the Unova Pokédex, Victini was\nassigned a special number: zero.\c\nI've heard the special number was\nassigned in the hope that Victini's power\r\nto bring victory would be shared with the\r\nTrainer who travels with this Pokédex...\c
How do you relate to Pokémon?\c\nAs you fill your Pokédex,\nyou'll find your own answer.\c\nThat's what I'm hoping for.\nSee you!\c

Oh, it's just a kid...\c
You... It couldn't be...\c\nThe fact that you are here means you\ncame to learn about the secret\r\nof Genesect!\c
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from\na Fossil.\c\nThen we enhanced the Pokémon with the\npower of science!\c
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!\c
But, our lord N was not interested in\nthis Genesect that was modified by the\r\npower of science!\c
“Science damages the natural beauty\nof Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"\c
That's what he said...\c\nSo our research was halted, and this\nfacility was closed...\c
However!!\nThe Genesect research is all mine!\c\nSo if you want to know Genesect's\nsecret, you'll have to beat me in battle!\c
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything...\c\nI forgot my duty as a Scientist is\nto make the world happy.\c\nSo, this must be what I get for trying to\nmake a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...\c
I'm going to wash my hands of this\nGenesect matter...\c\nI don't need this anymore...\nI'll give it to you.\c
There was another one in my\nother pocket...\c
The item I just gave you was made\nfor Genesect.\c\nWhen it holds an item like this, it\nchanges the type of the move called\r\nTechno Blast, so it can always have\r\nan advantage.\c
There sure are some very cowardly\nTrainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives.\nUse them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the\nside of the monitor.\c\nRead it?
“My lord N apparently rejected\nmy research...\r\nBut my research is necessary for\r\nTeam Plasma to reach its goal...\r\nThe strongest Pokémon..."\c\nThe rest of the memo is torn and\nimpossible to read.

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Not bad...\c\nYou're thinking about how to bring out\nyour Pokémon's strength.\c\nI should be able to count\non you for backup!\c\nWhat are you doing here anyway?\c\nHuh?\nA Town Map?\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over\nthe Town Map!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Tch...\nShe didn't have to do that...\c\nThanks to you, too. We just left,\nand you've already helped me out.\c
???: I thought it was lively around here!\nYou were having a Pokémon battle, huh?\r\nIsn't it nice to be young!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Who are you?\c
???: Who am I?\c\nI'm the owner of this ranch!\nAnd this is my wife!\c
Wife: After a Pokémon battle, you\nshould heal your Pokémon's HP, right?\r\nHere, I'll give you this!\c
And one for you!\c
It's nice to have Potions when\nyou're far away from a Pokémon Center.\c
Owner: By the way, you didn't happen\nto see a Herdier around here, did you?\c\nI can't figure out where it went.\c\nOur two Herdier are always together\nand this is the first time one has\r\nwandered off, so I'm a little worried...\c

Owner: Why did he get so mad?\c\nI think it's probably just\nplaying somewhere in the ranch.\c

Herdier, where did you go?

Why haven't we found it yet?\nI'm worried about Herdier...
Oh! Here! I'll share something\ngood with you!\c
If your Pokémon is paralyzed,\nuse one of these on it!\c
Still, Pokémon don't just wander\noff on their own.\c\nIn a worst-case scenario,\nit might be involved in some trouble!
Yawrp!
Did you hear that just now?\c

Look deeper in the grove!
Herdier: Yaarrrp...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That cry!\nYou found it!\c\nWhat a relief!\c\nOK, I'll go call its Trainer,\nso you stay here with it!\c
???: Tch...\nYou little pest!\c\nI'm a member of a group that strikes\nfear into the hearts of those who\r\nstand before it: Team Plasma!\c\nEver heard of it?
That's right! We're the righteous group\nthat tried to conquer Unova two years\r\nback in order to liberate Pokémon!\c
Really? We're the righteous group\nthat tried to conquer Unova two years\r\nback in order to liberate Pokémon!\c
Whatever...\c\nFools will never understand us...\c\nStill...\c\nFirst I got lost chasing Herdier...\nand now some nosy kid caught me!\c\nAll of this is your fault!\nTake this!\c
OK! I'll use this opportunity\nto retreat for now!\c
Yap! Bwoof!
Owner: Herdier!\c\nWhat made you come all\nthe way back here?\c\nWell, at any rate, I'm really grateful\nfor your help, you two!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're awfully calm\nabout this!\c\nYour Pokémon might have\nbeen gone for good!\c\nTake better care of it!\c
Owner: Hmm...\nI wonder if something happened to him...\c\nIt's like he's afraid of\nlosing Pokémon...\c\nCome on, Herdier!\nEveryone's waiting! Let's go home!\c
Owner: Thanks! It's all thanks\nto you and your Pokémon!\c\nYou're really great! Hey, is that it?\nDid Alder train you?
This ranch started when a fence\nwas made to protect Pokémon!
Owner: It is strange for Herdier\nto wander off on its own.\c\nIt always plays with the other\none or works on the ranch...
Yup! You and your Pokémon\nare full of energy!
You and your Pokémon\nlook a little worn out...\c\nRest here a minute--you won't\nget anywhere all tired like that!\c
You and your Pokémon\nfound Herdier! Great!
Herdier: Bawoo...
Bawoof! Ba woof!

Hey there, Trainer!\nIt looks like you've got energetic\r\nPokémon there with ya!\c\nCan I ask a favor?\c\nI need to get the Workers\nin this complex fired up!\c\nHow about it?\nHelp a guy out, will ya?
Yeah! That's what I like to hear!\c\nThere are some new Workers\nhere in the complex!\c\nGo get those three raring to go!
Really? Nobody really wants\nanything enough anymore!
OK!\c\nThe three new Workers are\nin different parts of the complex!
Hey! Ya did it, didn't ya!\nThis is a token of my thanks!\c
The complex is lively, because everyone\nis so fired up and ready to go!
Working at this complex\nwas my dream...\c\nBut now that it's come true,\nI've got everything I want...
Working at this complex\nwas my dream...\c\nBut now that it's come true,\nI've got everything I want...\c\nWhat? The foreman said so? OK, fine.\nWe just have to battle, right?\c
I came to this complex so\nmy Pokémon could accomplish a lot!\c\nThat means that as a Trainer,\nI have to work like crazy!
I'm happy just to be with\nmy awesome Pokémon!
I'm happy just to be with\nmy awesome Pokémon!\c\nWhat? A battle?\nI guess so... I'll play a bit.\c
I completely forgot!\c\nIf I don't work really hard, my Pokémon\nwon't have a chance to shine!\c\nAll riiight! Time to get to work!
Every day is the same...
Every day is the same...\c\nI get bored when things don't change,\nso I don't mind battling you!\c
It's OK if every day's the same\nwhen I'm working at this complex!\r\nIt means there aren't any problems!
Heating crude oil separates\nit into many different components...\r\nThat's what this distillation tower is for!\c\nIt's also known as a topper,\nbut I want to call it a distillation tower.
Oh! My knowledge overflowed,\nand it was overheard!
The smokestacks of the complex\nrise up into the sky.\c\nThat powerful silhouette\nis sure breathtaking, isn't it?\c\nBy the way, they're burning up\nwaste gas.\c\nRecently, they've found all sorts\nof uses for this gas, though.
Oh! You overheard some\nof my vast stock of knowledge!
Those gas holders are sure an\nexpression of harmony, aren't they?\c\nThere's a reason behind that shape.\c\nA sphere is best for withstanding\nthe tremendous pressure inside.\c\nIt would be nice if they would draw\na Pokémon on these gas holders, too.
Oh! You overheard some\nof my breathtaking knowledge.\c\nAre you actually...interested\nin what I have to say?\c\nThat would mean I have\na complex buddy!\c\nThat makes me really happy!\nWell then, take this with you!
I know a lot about the complex, right?\c\nI was even scouted by the foreman,\nbut I'm happy just looking at it!
Oh my! Why, you have a\nPokédex, don't you?\c\nI heard that the newest Pokédex\nhas an amazing function called\r\nthe Habitat List!\c\nCould you use it to show me what kind\nof Pokémon live in this complex?\c
Oh? You don't have the\nHabitat List for the complex\r\nfilled up yet...
Amazing!\nThe Habitat List is filled up!\c\nSo amazing! There are so many\nPokémon living in this complex!\c\nHere, take these as thanks!\c
If you fill up the Habitat Lists, you might\ncomplete the Pokédex before you know it!

Um, you know what?\c\nThere's something I want to investigate\nhere in Reversal Mountain.\c\nBut the wild Pokémon here are really\ntough, and I'm having trouble with them!\c\nCould you come with me? Please?\c
Oh! Don't worry!\c\nI'll take care of healing\nour Pokémon, OK?\c\nReady? Let's go!\c
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHere! This is the place!\nLet's look around a little!\c
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHere! This is the place!\nLet's look around a little!\c
Know what?\nI didn't know what I was capable of,\r\nso I left on a journey to find out!
I'm...\nWell, I'm not the toughest Trainer.\c\nBut I was able to continue my journey\nbecause my Pokémon worked so hard\r\nfor me.
Trying to keep winning against\neveryone is really hard...\c\nBut it's easy to keep loving Pokémon,\nand that makes it all worthwhile.
I always want to know more\nabout the Pokémon I like!\c\nThat's why I started working as\nProfessor Juniper's assistant!
Actually, I'm not sure being a\nprofessor's assistant is really\r\nwhat I want to do...\c\nBut when I do the work,\nI have lots and lots of fun!
                              
                                
Oh! I want to do a little\nmore looking around.\r\nWant to split up for now?
OK, then!\c\nI want to do a little more research\nabout where Heatran might be!\c\nThank you for coming with me!\nBe careful on the rest of your journey!\c
Oh, OK!\c\nI want to do a little more\ninvestigating about Heatran.\c\nHeatran is a very rarely seen Pokémon,\nso if I find out more about it,\r\nProfessor Juniper will be really happy!\c\nThanks for helping me!\nBe careful on your journey!\c
OK! Then let's do a little more\nlooking around!\c
Reversal Mountain... I wonder...\nCould a Magma Stone be in there?\c\nHave you heard of it?\nThey say a Magma Stone was found\r\nin a volcano in the distant Sinnoh region.\c\nApparently, it had something\nto do with Heatran!
There's still something I want to\nlook for in Reversal Mountain.\r\nCome with me!\c\nDon't worry. I'll take care of healing\nour Pokémon, OK?\c\nOK, here we go!\c
You strike me as the type\nwho fills out the Habitat List!\c\nC'mon, tell me what kind of Pokémon\nlive in Reversal Mountain!\c
Oh... Still looking into it, huh?\c\nSome of the Pokémon are on the\noutside of Reversal Mountain as well.
Huh! That's amazing.\nSo these Pokémon live here, then!\c\nThanks for showing me something good!\nLet me pay you back with this!\c
False Swipe leaves a Pokémon\nwith 1 HP when it would have fainted.\c\nIt's a very restrained move.\c\nIt's a great TM to use for catching\nPokémon and filling out the Habitat List!

There is a Pokémon called Cresselia\nin the far Sinnoh region.\c\nIts wings shine like the crescent moon\nand keep nightmares away.
There is a Pokémon called Darkrai\nin the far Sinnoh region.\c\nTo protect itself, it drives people and\nPokémon away with terrible nightmares.
There are Pokémon called Drowzee.\c\nThey put others to sleep and eat their\ndreams. Eating nightmares can upset\r\ntheir stomachs.
There are Pokémon called Hypno.\c\nEach one carries a pendulum that\nit can swing to make people drowsy.\c\nIt has been said that a Hypno once\nhypnotized a child and took it away...
Some Pokémon know a move called\nDream Eater.\c\nWith this move, a Pokémon attacks while\nthe target is asleep and eats its dream.\c\nIt restores HP equal to half of\nthe damage inflicted on the target.
Some Pokémon have the Forewarn Ability.\c\nA Pokémon with this Ability is alerted to\none of the opposing Pokémon's moves.\c\nHigh-power moves will be recognized first.

Colress: Welcome!\c
I was asked by an acquaintance\nto help with his research.\c\nWhat I desire is to bring out\nthe entirety of Pokémon potential!\c\nIf I can accomplish that,\nI don't care what it takes!\c
If it means this strength must be\nbrought out by the interactions\r\nbetween Pokémon and Trainers,\r\nthen so be it!\c\nIf it means you have to use a merciless\napproach, like Team Plasma's,\r\nand force out all of the Pokémon's power,\r\nthen so be it!\c\nAnd yes, if the entire world\nis destroyed as a result,\r\nthen so be it...\c
That aside!\c\nThe reason I have been traveling all over\nUnova and battling many Pokémon Trainers\r\nis because I was testing the viability of\r\nthis approach to bringing out the full\r\nstrength of Pokémon.\c\nIn that respect, you've done\nan amazing job.\c\nWell now! Tell me if you have\nthe answer I desire or not!\c\nIf you're ready, come at me!
It looks like you're ready, then!\nOK! Let us begin!\c
Colress: So strong!\c\nYou're a very strong Trainer indeed!\nSo let me ask you this!\c\nAre you thinking of reaching\neven higher heights by understanding\r\neach other as Pokémon and Trainer?
I see...\c\nTo me, that is an ideal answer.\c\nTo think! That's what you\nactually believe!\c\nYou bring out the power of your\nPokémon with respect and love!\c
I see...\c\nIs that answer my truth?\c\nEven if that's your answer,\ndon't give up!\c\nThe reason you're so strong\nis that you treat your Pokémon\r\nwith respect and love!\c
Excuse me for repeating myself,\nbut if it will make Pokémon stronger,\r\nI don't care what it takes!\c\nIf interacting with Pokémon can increase\ntheir powers only to a certain point,\r\nthen their full strength must be brought\r\nout using a scientific approach.\r\nEven one without a conscience.\c
But you have shown me the\npotential of your approach.\c\nTo me, whether Team Plasma wins\nor whether you win will decide\r\nhow the relationship between\r\npeople and Pokémon should be!\c\nSo where will this be settled?\c\nStep on the warp panel on the other\nside of the room where Kyurem is\r\nbeing held.\c\nGood luck in your battle!
Colress: Could I say that you're\ncurious for coming clear out here?\c\nI dissolved Team Plasma.\c\nThe ones who are left here are deciding\nwhat they want to do.\c\nI would like to have them decide\nhow to live on their own!\c\nThere are far more questions in this\nworld that don't have any answers!\c
Well then...\c\nPlease show me you and your\nPokémon's strength once again!\c
In Pokémon battles where you can't\nafford to make a mistake,\r\nthe true nature of the Trainer's\r\npersonality becomes clear.\c\nI see!\c\nIf Trainers believe in their Pokémon\nto the fullest extreme, as you do,\r\ntheir Pokémon partners will also\r\ngive everything they have!\c\nSo that must be the answer\nI've been looking for.\c\nStill, I'm glad you won.\c\nFor one thing, I detested Ghetsis\nfrom the start!\c
Take this with you!\c\nThis Master Ball can catch\nany kind of Pokémon!\c\nGhetsis was saving it,\nbut you'll probably put it to better use!\c
If you'd like, please have a\nPokémon battle with me again!\c\nIndeed, I'm having trouble deciding\nwhat to do next as well.

Zinzolin: You're an impressive\nTrainer to have made it this far.\c
Since you went to such trouble\nto come here, I'll show you something.\c\nThis is...\c
The legendary Pokémon of ice!\nIts name is Kyurem!\c
The ice missiles we fired\ninto Opelucid City were\r\ncreated with Kyurem's power\r\nand Team Plasma's technology!\c
Well...\c\nYou could become a\nthreat to Team Plasma,\r\nso we will eliminate you here!\c
Not with me around, you won't!\c
Thanks for removing the barrier!\nThat was a big help!\c
Zinzolin: Hmph!\nWe'll simply eliminate both of you!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm not going\nto lose to Team Plasma!\c\nBy the way, what is this place?\c
That Pokémon...\c\nIt's so icy...\c\nCould that be the source of\nthe attack on Opelucid City?\c
Zinzolin: Hmph. You're a smarter\nTrainer than I expected.\c\nIf you've got that much sense,\nwhy did you do something as\r\ndangerous as sneaking into our base?\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That should be obvious!\c\nI'll do whatever it takes to get\nmy sister's Pokémon back!\c\nAre YOU the one who stole a\nPurrloin in Aspertia five years ago?\c
Zinzolin: If it's just a Purrloin,\nsomeone probably stole it\r\nand is using it.\c\nWhy can't you understand?\c\nThere are other Purrloin.\nWhy are you so fixated on this one?\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's the ONLY Purrloin\nin the world that my late grandpa\r\ncaught for my little sister!\c
Zinzolin: An individual's feelings...\c\nTo you, that's probably a\nmatter of great importance.\c\nBut from the perspective of other\npeople, it is a trifling matter indeed.\c\nCompare those feelings against\nthe majesty of this ship!\c\nThis ship itself is a device that\nuses the Pokémon Kyurem's power!\c\nWith this ship, this time we will\nconquer Unova!\c
It looks like Kyurem\nhas fully recovered.\c\nWe'll put the DNA Splicers\nto good use.\c\nI'll let you take care of them,\nShadow Triad!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Don't mess with me!\nYou were the one who lost!\c

???: That blasted Colress!\c
The fool is far too committed\nto pure science.\c\nThis is how he repays me for\nmaking him the boss of Team Plasma?\c\nHow dare he put his personal\nintellectual curiosity before our\r\nultimate mission of conquering Unova!\c
How fortunate for you!\c\nFew get to be the sole audience member\nfor one of my speeches.\c
Team Plasma will use its\nknowledge and technology\r\nto take Kyurem's true\r\npower to its absolute limit\r\nand freeze the Unova region.\c\nThe terrified people and Pokémon\nwill bow at Team Plasma's...no...\r\nat MY feet!\c
Kyurem is an empty being.\c\nThe remnants of a certain Pokémon\nwhen it split into Reshiram and\r\nZekrom...\c\nMy desire is absolute rule of Unova!\c
That's right! Kyurem will be the vessel\ninto which my desires will be poured!\c
Shadow Triad: Lord Ghetsis.\nKyurem has been transferred!\c
Ghetsis: It's finally here!\c\nThe wonderful era in which\nI am the absolute ruler of Unova\r\nhas finally arrived!\c\nI'll let you take care of this!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait...\nYou're one of the Shadow Triad, right?\c\nTell me about the Purrloin\nthat was stolen in Aspertia.\c
Shadow Triad: Very well...\c\nThis might be it.\c
Grrooowwwl!
Shadow Triad: I stole this Pokémon\nfive years ago in Aspertia.\c\nSo it seems likely that it is the\nPokémon you're talking about.\c\nBut now, it only listens to my commands.\c\nSuch is the fate of Pokémon\nthat are trapped in Poké Balls!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wh-what?\c\nDon't mess with me...\nThat's someone else's Pokémon!\c
Shadow Triad: Ah...\nI feel sorry for Pokémon.\c\nThey're ruled by Poké Balls\nand the whims of their Trainers...\c\nLord Ghetsis spoke of\nPokémon liberation two years ago\r\nsimply for his own ambitions, but...\c\nIf his plans had succeeded, many Pokémon\nwould have been saved.\c\nThis Liepard--well, you knew it as a\nPurrloin--if it had been released,\r\nit might have returned to you.\c\nWell then...\c
You there!\nI won't let you interfere with\r\nLord Ghetsis's plans!\c
Shadow Triad: You're not done yet...
Shadow Triad: If you want to go any\nfurther, you'll have to get past us.\c
Shadow Triad: I have no problem\nwith you, but this is for Lord Ghetsis!\c
Shadow Triad: Even if I lose,\nLord Ghetsis simply has to win...
Shadow Triad: We swore to be loyal\nto Lord Ghetsis since he saved us!\c
Shadow Triad: Listen well!\c\nThe only thing we want is\nthe world Lord Ghetsis desires!
Shadow Triad: Can you defeat\nall three of us?
Shadow Triad: No matter...\c\nThe only thing you can do is\nwatch Lord Ghetsis use Kyurem\r\nto freeze Unova solid. That's all...\c
You...\nI'll return this Pokémon to you.\c\nConsidering what Lord Ghetsis\nis about to do,\r\nI have no further need of it.\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sorry...\c\nThis situation is messing with my head...\nI just don't know what to do...\c\nI finally found my sister's Pokémon,\nbut now it's glaring at me...\c\nWhy?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\c\n...\c\nHey...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIf we let Team Plasma\ndo whatever they want...\c\nThere'll be more sad Pokémon\nlike Purrloin and Kyurem...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: It must be a hard job,\nkeeping an eye on your former allies.\c\nSay, you don't know anything about a\nPurrloin stolen in Aspertia, do you?\c
S-sorry, but I don't know\nanything about that...\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's what I figured.\c\nI wouldn't expect someone from a\ngroup bent on world domination\r\nto be all that quick on the uptake.\c
Oh...\c\nBut I honestly wanted\nto save Pokémon...

I just joined Team Plasma, and\nthey won't give me a Pokémon yet.\c\nBut even a guy like me has\nsomething useful to share.\c\nYou need the Plasma Card\nto enter the password!

You didn't think I was just going\nto tell you the password, did you?\c\nYou'll have to figure it out\nfrom the others!
Zinzolin: The device is indestructible!\c\nYou will never be able to release Kyurem!\c
You don't have the sense to know\nwhen to quit, it seems.\c\nIt's an act of mercy on my part\nto bring this to an end now!\c
Zinzolin: Beaten again?!\c\nNo matter!\nTeam Plasma will get the last laugh!

Without the Plasma Card,\nyou can't enter the password.\c\nDo the rest by yourself.
Oh, poor Kyurem.\nIt was cruelly forced to work.\c\nIt must have felt terrible.
The Plasma Frigate is a ship designed\nto be ecological. It runs on\r\nKyurem's ice energy and solar panels.\c\nYou've got to keep the environment in\nmind when ruling a region like Unova.

They say Area 6 is located so high\nthat you cannot see it from\r\nthe ground...\c\nI wonder how high it is.\c\nAs a researcher, I'm very interested.
I heard that you cleared the\nArea at the top, too...\c\nGreat! Literally, you're a person\nabove the clouds!
I sense strong power\nthat I've never felt before...\c\nI can't stop...trembling...\c\nI wonder what is hidden\nin this Unova's Challenge?
What is this power?\nIt's getting stronger and stronger!\c\nUh... I'm all tingly inside...\c\nUnova's Challenge, the Black Tower...\nWhat kind of secret does it have...?
When I heard that you cleared all of\nthe Areas, all became clear to me.\c\nThe power that I've felt... The power\nthat made me tremble...\c\nIt was the potential\nyou possess!

Hello. Excuse me.\c\nI'm terribly sorry to ask, but\nwill you buy a bottle of Fresh Water\r\nfor $300?
Thank you very much!\c\nBuying Fresh Water for $300,\nwhich is more expensive than usual...\r\nWhat a generous person you are!\c\nI'll never forget your kindness\nfor the rest of my life!
Yes, I know.\nI know!\c\n$300 a bottle is expensive!\c\nBut, if I don't sell this,\nI'll be in trouble...\c
My wife wants to buy a Bag\nfrom a really expensive brand...\c\nIf I don't buy it for her,\nour relationship might go sour...\c
I have a daughter who's a Trainer.\c\nIt's natural for a father to want to buy\na lot of things like new Ultra Balls and\r\nHyper Potions for his daughter...\c
My son and his wife send me money,\nbut they can't send very much...\c\nI know I shouldn't rely on them,\nbut there is a lot going on.\c
I want to buy some toys\nfor my adorable grandchildren.\c\nTheir tastes are quite expensive.\nBut I want to see their happy faces...\c
I don't really have\nany special reasons...\c\nBut the full-course meal I ate\nyesterday was incredibly expensive!\c
So, to help this old man...\c\nPlease buy my Fresh Water\nfor $300. Please.
Sigh...\c\nWell, since you're stubborn,\nI'll stop asking.\c\nBut when you change your mind,\nplease come back anytime.\c\nI'll be selling Fresh Water\nfor $300 right here!
Y-you... $300...\nYou don't have it?!\c\nI didn't say anything! Don't worry.\nYou don't have to buy Fresh Water.
You... You can't carry any more\nFresh Water!\c\nWow! You're a Fresh Water maniac!\nPlease buy it from me\r\nnext time you need some!

[VAR BE09(0002)]Thank...\c\nWhat?\nOh...\c\nWithout Fresh Water...\nI can't run on bridges anymore.[VAR BE09(0000)]
Yay! I ran on all the bridges\nin the Unova region!\c\nIt's all thanks to you!\nPlease! Accept these!\c
Oh... Your Bag is full.
The bridge I like best for running\nis the Tubeline Bridge.\c\nI get to race the trains!\nThat gives me power!
The curve here is like...errrrk...\nand then when you pass the curve,\r\nwhoooosh, zoooom!\c\n...Do you understand the dialect\nof Goldenrod City?

How is your Pokédex coming along?\nCan I see it?
Let me see...\c\nOh, you've seen [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon in the\nUnova region!
Let me see...\c\nOh, you've caught [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon in the\nUnova region!
This Pokédex is full of memories from your\njourney. It's a treasure you can cherish\r\nfor your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you\nshould try walking through tall grass!\c
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now!\nYou're getting off to a good start!\c
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't\ngive up! Keep checking the tall grass.\c
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon.\c\nSo battling them is a great way to fill up\nyour Pokédex, too!\c
Some Pokémon are only found in\ncertain caves!\c\nYou might want to go back and search\ncaves you've already passed through.\c
Wow, it's getting really full!\c\nI'm sure looking over your Pokédex will\nbring back memories of your journey.\c
Over 100 Pokémon...\c\nIt's so much fun looking over all their\ndifferent characteristics!\c
Bianca probably told you about it,\nbut are you checking the\r\nrustling grass, too?\c\nThe more you walk, the more your chance\nof finding rustling grass increases.\c
There are various Abilities, but\ndo you fully understand them?\c\nCertain Abilities make wild Pokémon\ncome out more often!\c
It may be hard to find their\nentrances in the trees,\r\nbut you should look for Hidden Grottoes.\c\nI don't know why, but Pokémon that live\nthere all have quite uncommon Abilities!\c
Over 200 different Pokémon!\c\nThis world is filled with so many\nPokémon interacting with one another!\c
It's incredible that the number of kinds\nof Pokémon has increased this much\r\nover such a short time.\c\nThe adaptability of Pokémon is amazing.\c
That is an excellent Pokédex!\nJust a little more, and it will be full!\c
What a wonderful Pokédex!\nA little more work, and it'll be complete!\c\nI'm really glad I asked you to do this!\c
Amazing! Truly amazing!\c\nYou've met all of the Pokémon in the\nUnova region!\c\nCongratulations!\c\nNow here's your next challenge: see how\nmany of those Pokémon you can catch!\r\nI'll keep evaluating for you!\c
Little by little, more detailed information\nis being entered into the Pokédex!\r\nDo your best!\c
Are you trying out different kinds of\nPoké Balls for your captures?\c\nThey come in lots of varieties, so be sure\nto use the right one at the right time!\c
If you read the Pokédex descriptions,\nyou can learn a lot of unexpected facts\r\nabout Pokémon! It's fun!\c
Evolving Pokémon is another important\nway to fill up your Pokédex. It's not\r\njust about catching them!\c
Trading Pokémon with friends also\ncounts as catching them!\c
When you've met this many Pokémon, do\nyou have trouble picking which ones to\r\ntravel with?\c
Over 100 different Pokémon! Great!\c\nIdentify your goal using the\nHabitat List.\c\nThat way, you may be able to motivate\nyourself even more.\c
Some moves are very useful\nfor catching Pokémon, right?\c\nTeaching False Swipe to your Pokémon\nis one such approach.\c
You can't meet some Pokémon\nunless you find their Eggs!\c
Depending on the season,\nsome Pokémon are easier to find\r\nand some Pokémon are harder to find.\c
You've caught more than 200 different\nPokémon!\c\nI'm glad that I entrusted the Pokédex\nto such a wonderful Trainer.\c
Even after researching so\nmany Pokémon...\r\ntheir origin...\r\nwhere they were born...\c\nThere are so many things\nwe still don't know.\c
You've caught so many Pokémon.\nYou might know more than me now!\c\nI'm cheering for you to complete\nyour Pokédex!\c
With just a little more effort, you will\nhave completed a perfect Pokédex!\c\nYou've come this far, so don't give up...\nNo, just enjoy it as much as possible!\c
Amazing! Absolutely amazing!\c\nYou've caught every Pokémon\nin the Unova region!\c\nCongratulations!!\c
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\c\nI have something I want to give you!\nPlease come to the lab when you can.
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at\na good clip!\c\nHere! This is a gift to thank you for all\nyour hard work!\c
If you have a Permit,\nyou can go to the Nature Preserve\r\nfrom Mistralton City by plane!\c\nGo check it out to see\nwhat kind of place it is!\c
If you have an Oval Charm,\nwe don't know why,\r\nbut you'll have a better chance to\r\nfind Eggs at the Pokémon Day Care!\c
If you have a Shiny Charm,\nwe don't know why, but you'll have a\r\nbetter chance to find Shiny Pokémon!\c
Try using this, too!\c
Keep up the good work!
You're here to show me how your\nPokédex is coming along, right?
I see!\c\nYou've caught [VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon, then...
Oh, really...\c\nIf you want me to have a look at\nyour Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than\n600 Pokémon!\c\nYou'll have to be persistent and\ncatch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places\nyou've already been.\c\nRetrace your steps in the Unova region\nand see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon,\nyou first have to reduce its HP.\c\nYou're pretty good at this now,\nbut don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care?\c\nI've heard that some Pokémon can only be\ncaught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod?\c\nThere are many Pokémon that live in the\nwater. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe?\c\nFalse Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of\nthe targeted Pokémon's HP.\c\nIt's great for catching, because it\ndoesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look?\c\nIf you use Mean Look on a Pokémon,\nit can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to\nevolve. Some Pokémon even evolve\r\nthrough friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks?\c\nBig groups of Pokémon appear during a\nmass outbreak. It's a great chance to\r\ncatch them!
You've caught more than 400\ndifferent Pokémon?!\c\nThat's incredible!\nYou're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon\nevolve when they are leveled up\r\nin a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon...\c\nMy, the variation of these beings called\nPokémon certainly is surprising!\c\nAnd the fact that you've caught so many\ndifferent kinds... That's pretty\r\nsurprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab\non Route 15?\c\nMastering a facility like that is an\naccomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete\nyour Pokédex, huh?\c\nCatching this many Pokémon must mean...\nYou really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex.\c\nHow about it? Would you research Pokémon\nwith me?
Oh! Just a little more until your\nPokédex is complete!\c\nMake sure you go trade with friends\nto get the ones you're missing!
...\n...\c\nThis blows me away! It's so wonderful,\nI'm at a loss for words.\c\nYou... You've accomplished something\ntruly outstanding.\c\nFilling up the National Pokédex makes you\na Trainer among Trainers!\c\nI'm so happy I was able to meet a\nfantastic Trainer like you!\r\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Oh! We have a gift for you.\nMy daughter has it.\r\nGo speak to her and get it!

Welcome to the White Treehollow,\nnewcomer.\c\nLooks like the gate Trainer recognized\nyour abilities.\c\nNow it's time for me to evaluate just\nhow good you are!\c\nDon't hold back against me.\nLet's battle!\c
Impressive to have made it this\nfar without giving up.\c\nYou'd better give it all you've got if you\nwant to beat me. Don't want all of your\r\nefforts to have been in vain, do you?\c\nTime to complete Area 2 and graduate\nfrom being a newcomer!\c
I didn't stand a chance...\c\nThat last Trainer was in another league.\c\nMakes me jealous that someone else has\nso much natural talent and strength!\c\nOh well, enough of that! It's your turn\nnext! Come at me!\c
What do you think of the\nWhite Treehollow? Strange place, huh?\c\nWe don't even know how far down\nthis place goes.\c\nMakes you wonder what's at the bottom,\nthough, doesn't it?\c\nTime to see if you have the strength\nto make it that far down!\c
So, you're the next challenger.\c\nI hope you can provide me with at least\nsome entertainment.\c\nI came here to battle against\nstrong Trainers!\c\nI'll decide if you count as one!\nLet's get this started!\c
Hmm? What's a kid like you doing\naround here?\c\nYou'd better be serious if you plan\non battling in this area.\c\nGo back to Area 5 if you're looking to\nplay with the other kids.\c\n...Oh?

Do you like battling?\c\nDay after day, I continue to battle, but\nI still don't know what true strength is.\c\n...Oh, excuse me!\c\nA Trainer can't talk like this!\c\nShow me what kind of strength you have!\c
Back in Grampa Alder's house.\c\nWe promised, remember?\c\nWe're gonna compete with each other.\c\nAnd see who's stronger!\c
I'm here battling everyone in sight in\norder to become the strongest Trainer!\c\nYou're here for the same purpose, right?\nWhat does it mean to be the strongest?\c\nThat's the question in your head, right?\nYou came here for the answer, right?\c\nI think our battle may bring us one\nstep closer to finding out just who is\r\nthe strongest in Unova!\c\nIt's too bad no one is here to watch our\nbattle, but let's have a good one!\c\nLet's get this battle on!\c

What do you think of the Black Tower?\nThere's no building taller in Unova!\c\nNone of us even know how high up it goes.\c\nMakes you wonder what's at the top,\nthough, doesn't it?\c\nTime to see if you have the strength\nto make it that far up!\c
So, you're the next challenger.\c\nI hope you can provide me with at least\nsome entertainment.\c\nI just love battling with\nstrong Trainers!\c\nI'll decide if you count as one!\nLet's get this started!\c
Hmm? What's a kid like you doing\naround here?\c\nYou'd better be serious if you plan\non battling in this area.\c\nGo back to Area 5 if you're looking to\nplay with the other kids.\c\n...Oh?

Do you like battling?\c\nDay after day, I continue to battle, but\nI still don't know what true strength is.\c\n...Oh, excuse me!\c\nA Trainer can't talk like this!\c\nShow me what kind of strength you have!\c

You've gotten a lot stronger.\nCan't call you a newcomer anymore!\c\nI'm excited to see just how far\nyou'll go.\c\nCome challenge me again sometime!\c
You got a lot stronger! It seems like\nonly yesterday you were the newcomer.\c\nEither that, or I just got a lot weaker.\c\nLooks like I need to get in some\nreal training.\c
I couldn't beat you this time, either.\nYou sure are strong.\c\nI've got to train a lot harder.\nI won't lose next time!\c
Wow! You got even stronger. What a big\ndifference compared to last time.\c\nJust how far can you go?\c\nMaking it to the bottom is quite\nthe accomplishment.\c
Looks like I couldn't win.\c\nI'm excited to find out just how strong\nyou'll become!\c\nI'll do my best to make sure I can\nbeat you the next time we battle.\c
You're even better than before!\nI'll admit it--you're tough!\c\nIf you want to find strong Trainers\nlike yourself, check the areas up ahead.\c
It's not enough!\nI want to battle you even more!\c\nYou'd better come back sometime!\nYou'd better battle with me again!\c
All right. Good battle!\c\nWhat's that?\nYou still want to battle?\c\nYou sure are greedy!\c\nThen again, you've got to know what you\nwant to survive up ahead.\c\nWell, if you feel up to it, come back\nsome other time. I'll battle you again.\c
Did this battle help you get any closer\nto becoming whatever it is you're aiming\r\nto become?\c\nI'll battle with you until you find the\nanswer. As many times as it takes.\c\nCome back again sometime!\c
So exciting!\c\nMy grampa was the Champion!\c\nBut Trainers like you are even stronger!\c\nWe just need to keep competing.\c\nThen we can keep aiming higher.\c\nAs Pokémon Trainers!\c\nAnd as people!\c\nAnd it's all thanks to our Pokémon!\c\nCome again!\c\nI want to keep aiming higher!\c
You're strong.\c\nThere's no doubt that you're the\nstrongest Trainer in the\r\nWhite Treehollow...\c\nHowever, it remains to be seen if you're\nthe strongest in Unova...\c\nThere's still all sorts of powerful\nTrainers that you haven't met yet.\c\nKeep it up, and never stop aiming for\nthe top!\c
You've gotten a lot stronger.\nCan't call you a newcomer anymore!\c\nI'm excited to see just how far\nyou'll go.\c\nCome challenge me again sometime!\c
You got a lot stronger! It seems like\nyesterday when you were the newcomer.\c\nEither that, or I just got a lot weaker.\c\nLooks like I need to get in some\nreal training.\c
I couldn't beat you this time, either.\nYou sure are strong.\c\nI've got to train a lot harder.\nI won't lose next time!\c

It's not enough!\nI want to battle you even more!\c\nYou'd better come back sometime!\nYou'd better battle with me again!\c
All right. Good battle!\c\nWhat's that?\nYou still want to battle?\c\nYou sure are greedy!\c\nThen again, you've got to know what you\nwant to survive up ahead.\c\nWell, if you feel up to it, come back\nsome other time. I'll battle you again.\c

You're more impressive than I imagined.\c\nI'll give you one final hint that you\nmay find useful.\c\nYou encountered all kinds of Trainers\non your way here, right?\c\nDid you notice that the information each\nof them knew was different?\c\nSome know where the gate Trainer is,\nand some know where a Doctor is,\r\nfor example.\c\nTry battling with all of the Trainers to\nfind the best way through this place.\c\nBe on your way now. I look forward to\nhearing all about your exploits.\c
Congratulations!\nYou've graduated from newcomer status.\c\nYou've still got a long way to go, though!\nGood luck in the next area.\c
Impressive!\nYou've certainly proven your strength.\c\nIn honor of your completion of Area 3,\nI'll give you a hint about Area 4.\c\nStarting with Area 4, the areas become\nmuch larger!\c\nThis means it becomes even harder to\nfind the gate Trainer.\c\nPay close attention to the hints that\nthe other Trainers give you, and do your\r\nbest to find the gate Trainer.\c\nGood luck! I'm excited to see how\nfar you will make it!\c
You got me!\nYou sure are strong...\c\nWith strength like yours, you might\njust be able to make it to the top.\c\nGood luck in the next area!\c
You're strong!\c\nBut don't let it go to your head...\c\nThere are other Trainers just as strong\nas you, or even stronger, up ahead!\c\nWhen you run into one of those Trainers,\nI'd sure like to be there to witness\r\nthe battle!\c\nCome back again sometime!\c
I give up! I give up!\nYou win.\c\nI guess age doesn't matter when it comes\nto Pokémon strength.\c\nBut you'd better keep your guard up.\nThe Trainers up ahead have dedicated\r\ntheir lives to battling.\c\nI look forward to seeing how far\nyou can prevail!\c
I lost! I lost!\nI haven't lost this badly in a long time!\c\nGet on to the next area.\c\nI'll be waiting here for the\nnext challenger.\c\nI wonder who it will be?\nI can't wait to battle!\c
Oh, dear. It looks like I lost.\nYou're a strong one, aren't you?\c\nYou're already that strong, but you\nstill have your sights set higher...\c\nJust how far will you go? Will your rise\never end?\c\nI hope you can achieve whatever goal\nyou've set for yourself!\c
What amazing strength!\c\nYou might just have the kind of strength\nthat I've been looking for...\c\nI felt the same kind of strength from\na young man I battled some time ago...\c\nHow did you come across such strength?\nTell me your secret someday!\c
So exciting!\c\nYou and your Pokémon's combination!\c\nAmazing teamwork!\c\nPlaces where humans can't go alone.\c\nPlaces where Pokémon don't think to go.\c\nYou can go anywhere with teamwork.\c\nBetween Trainers and Pokémon!\c\nLike you and me!\c\nI'm glad you understand that now!\c\nHey!\c\nHey!!\c\nHey!!!\c\nYou'd better come to Grampa's house!\c\nYou know where it is: in Floccesy Town!\c\nI'll give you something awesome!\c\nIt's a promise, OK?\c
So strong...\c\nI've never met another Trainer\nas strong as you.\c\nThat was the most intense battle I've\nhad in my entire life!\c\nDid you get a glimpse of what it means\nto be the strongest?\c\nI think that you may have a chance at\nachieving that!\c
You're more impressive than I imagined.\c\nI'll give you one final hint that you\nmay find useful.\c\nYou encountered all kinds of Trainers\non your way here, right?\c\nDid you notice that the information each\nof them knew was different?\c\nSome know where the gate Trainer is,\nand some know where a Nurse is,\r\nfor example.\c\nTry battling with all of the Trainers to\nfind the best way through this place.\c\nBe on your way, now. I look forward to\nhearing all about your exploits.\c
Congratulations!\nYou've graduated from newcomer status.\c\nYou've still got a long way to go, though!\nGood luck in the next area.\c
Impressive!\nYou've certainly proven your strength.\c\nIn honor of your completion of Area 3,\nI'll give you a hint about Area 4.\c\nStarting with Area 4, the areas become\nmuch larger!\c\nThis means it becomes even harder to\nfind the gate Trainer.\c\nPay close attention to the hints that\nthe other Trainers give you, and do your\r\nbest to find the gate Trainer.\c\nGood luck! I'm excited to see how\nfar you will make it!\c
You got me!\nYou sure are strong...\c\nWith strength like yours, you might\njust be able to make it to the bottom.\c\nGood luck in the next area!\c
You're strong!\c\nBut don't let it get to your head...\c\nThere are other Trainers just as strong\nas you, or even stronger, up ahead!\c\nWhen you run into one of those Trainers,\nI'd sure like to be there to witness\r\nthe battle!\c\nCome back again sometime!\c

Oh, well. It looks like I lost.\nYou're tough!\c\nEven though you're already that strong,\nyou still have your sights set higher...\c\nJust how far will you go? Will your rise\never end?\c\nI hope you can achieve whatever goal\nyou've set for yourself!\c
What amazing strength!\c\nYou might just have the kind of strength\nthat I've been looking for...\c\nI felt the same kind of strength from\na young man I battled some time ago...\c\nHow did you come across such strength?\nTell me your secret someday!\c

Your Pokémon look tired...\nShall I recover them?
OK. If you want me to recover your\nPokémon, just let me know!
Training is important, but make sure\nyou're not overworking your Pokémon!
What's wrong? Your Pokémon look tired!\nShall I recover them?
OK!\nJust remember not to overdo it!
You've still got a long road ahead.\nGood luck!

Area [VAR 0201(0000)]
Hmm? Are you a new challenger?\nIs that so?\c\nThat expression on your face is telling me\nthat you've got no idea what to do.\c\nAll right! I suppose I can spare some\nadvice for a newcomer.\c\nFirst of all, you should know that in\norder to complete an area and advance,\r\nyou must defeat the Boss Trainer.\c\nYou can try to seek out the Boss Trainer\nwithout any leads if you want.\c\nHowever, it's probably a better idea to\nchallenge the other Trainers first.\c\nA lot of them know quite a bit about the\narea and might be able to provide you\r\nwith useful information!\c
Oh? If it isn't the challenger that\neveryone's talking about!\c\nI've heard quite a lot about you.\c\nYou're still new here, so I'll give\nyou some advice.\c\nYou know about the elevators, right?\c\nIf you feel like you can't continue any\nlonger, come back to the elevator in the\r\narea and return to the lobby.\c\nAny prize money you won in the area will\nbe taken back, but a first-class Trainer\r\nknows when it's time to quit.\c\nTesting your limits can be a good thing,\nbut don't overdo it!\c
Have you come to challenge\nthe Black Tower?\c\nOh, me? I'm here for a different reason.\c\nI've come to investigate this facility.\c\nDon't you think this place is strange?\c\nI mean, this building wasn't even here\ntwo years ago.\c\nIt's full of mysteries, I'm telling you.\c\nAnyway, see you around!\c
Oh, it's you again!\c\nI've been investigating this place\nthe whole time and learned some\r\ninteresting things.\c\nApparently, a certain financial group\nfunded the construction of this place.\c\nI still don't know why and for what\npurpose they built this place, though.\c\nI've heard rumors that they're watching\nthe Trainers in here battle for their\r\nentertainment from some remote location.\c\nOthers say that they built this place so\nthey could find a Trainer that's stronger\r\nthan the Champion!\c\nThere are all sorts of rumors, but I just\ncan't verify any of them.\c\nThe more I investigate this place, the\nmore interesting stories I come across.\c\nAnyway, see you around!\c
Hey! You made it to Area 5!\c\nI've done even more investigation since\nthe last time we met and found out some\r\ninteresting new information.\c\nThe real purpose of this place is to\ngather data on Pokémon battles.\c\nBattle-loving Trainers from across the\nland happily gather here for a challenge.\c\nAll the while, there's someone out there\nmonitoring and gathering data on all of\r\nthese battles.\c\nBut a Pokémon's true strength isn't\ndecided just by data.\c\nIt's all about the teamwork between a\nTrainer and his or her Pokémon.\c\nThat's what really decides a Pokémon's\ntrue strength.\c\nWell, I'm heading off to my next\ninvestigation site.\c\nThere's this quiet town, full of nature,\nwhere suddenly a massive tree appeared!\c\nWell, I guess this is good-bye!\c
Oh, hey! You made it this far, huh?\c\nYou and your Pokémon sure make\na great team!\c\nI tell you, it's the teamwork between\nhumans and Pokémon that brought\r\nthe world to where it is today.\c\nThroughout history we've complemented\neach other to overcome all obstacles!\c\nIt might be that this place exists so we\ncan experience that history firsthand!\c\nSee you around!\c
Hmm? Are you a new challenger?\nOh, my...\c\nThat expression on your face is telling me\nthat you've got no idea what to do.\c\nAll right! I suppose I can spare some\nadvice for a newcomer.\c\nFirst of all, you should know that in\norder to complete an area and advance,\r\nyou must defeat the Boss Trainer.\c\nYou can try to seek out the Boss Trainer\nwithout any leads if you want.\c\nHowever, it's probably a better idea to\nchallenge the other Trainers first.\c\nA lot of them know quite a bit about the\narea and might be able to provide you\r\nwith useful information!\c
Oh? If it isn't the challenger that\neveryone's talking about!\c\nI hear you're stronger than you look.\c\nYou're still new here, so I'll give\nyou some advice.\c\nYou know about the elevators, right?\c\nIf you feel like you can't continue any\nlonger, come back to the elevator in the\r\narea and return to the lobby.\c\nAny prize money you won in the area will\nbe taken back, so it's important to know\r\nwhen to quit.\c\nTesting your limits can be a good thing,\nbut don't overdo it!\c
Have you come to challenge the\nWhite Treehollow?\c\nOh, me? I'm here for a different reason.\c\nI'm just on a journey to become\neven stronger.\c\nEnough about that... Don't you think\nthis place is strange?\c\nI mean, it wasn't even here\ntwo years ago.\c\nIt's full of mysteries, I'm telling you.\c\nWhatever. I'm satisfied as long as I\ncan continue my training.\c\nAnyway, see you around!\c
Oh, hey!\nIt's you again!\c\nGet this! I heard a really strange\nstory about this place!\c\nApparently, some conservation group did\na thorough investigation of this place\r\nbefore opening it up to the public.\c\nI wonder why they opened up this place\nas a training facility...\c\nI guess it's because this place\nis so huge.\c\nYou don't have to worry about\nother stuff and can focus on training.\c\nAnyway, see you around!\c
Hey! You made it to Area 5!\c\nOh yeah. I learned the reason why this\nplace was opened up for us Trainers!\c\nApparently, this place wasn't actually\nfully explored before they opened it up!\c\nThey're letting Trainers battle and train\nin here, but the real reason they opened\r\nthis place up is to have strong Trainers\r\nexplore the depths of this place!\c\nThat is, Trainers just like you, who have\nstrong bonds with their Pokémon!\c\nI wonder if you'll ever make your\nway to the bottom.\c\nWell, I think I'm just about done\ntraining in here.\c\nFor the next stop on my journey, I've\ndecided to check out the rumors about\r\na building that was suddenly constructed\r\nin a certain city.\c\nStrength isn't something that you can\nachieve in just one day.\c\nLet's both do our best!\c
Oh, hey! You made it this far, huh?\c\nYou and your Pokémon sure make\na great team!\c\nI tell you, it's the teamwork between\nhumans and Pokémon that brought\r\nthe world to where it is today.\c\nThroughout history we've complemented\neach other to overcome all obstacles!\c\nIt might be that this place exists so we\ncan experience that history firsthand!\c\nSee you around!\c
Hey, newcomer! How are you doing?\c\nTake a look around this room.\nSee that strange door?\c\nThat's a gate that leads into the\nroom where the Boss Trainer waits.\c\nThe gate is closed right now, though,\nso you can't go through.\c\nFirst, you'll need to find the gate\nTrainer somewhere in this area and get\r\nhim or her to open the gate for you.\c\nHowever, they'll only open the gate\nfor Trainers that they deem to be\r\nstrong enough!\c\nSo, it's up to you to battle the gate\nTrainer and prove your strength!\c\nOh, by the way, the gate Trainer of\nthis area is actually me!\c\nI'll be waiting for you somewhere in this\narea, so come find me!\c
Oh, hi! We meet again!\nHow are you doing?\c\nRemember, you can't use items in here.\c\nAren't you and your Pokémon starting to\nget a bit tired?\c\nIf you are, seek out a Doctor!\c\nJust talk to one of them, and the\nDoctor should recover your Pokémon.\c\nYou'll have to have a battle\nfirst, though.\c\nWell, I'm gonna go on ahead.\nDon't keep me waiting too long!\c
Wow, you've made it this far!\nImpressive.\c\nSince you're trying so hard, I'll\ngive you another hint.\c\nWhen you've lost your way!\c\nWhen your Pokémon are feeling down!\c\nWhen you want to leave immediately!\c\nThis book comes in handy in times\nlike those.\c\nThe book is called “Adventure Rules for\nUnova's Challenge"!\c\nIt says here, “Press the X Button to\nmake the RETIRE button appear. Press\r\nthat to return to the lobby!"\c\nOf course, if you choose to retire, your\nchallenge will be considered a failure,\r\nso choose wisely!\c\nI'm the gate Trainer for this area,\nso I'll be waiting for you somewhere!\r\nCome find me!\c
Hello, newcomer.\nHow are you doing?\c\nTake a look around this room.\nSee that strange door?\c\nThat's a gate that leads into the\nroom where the Boss Trainer waits.\c\nThe gate is closed right now, though,\nso you can't go through.\c\nFirst, you'll need to find the gate\nTrainer somewhere in this area and get\r\nhim or her to open the gate for you.\c\nHowever, they'll only open the gate\nfor Trainers that they deem to be\r\nstrong enough!\c\nSo, it's up to you to battle the gate\nTrainer and prove your strength!\c\nOh, by the way, the gate Trainer of\nthis area is actually me!\c\nI'll be waiting for you somewhere in this\narea, so come find me!\c
Well, hello. We meet again.\nHow are you doing?\c\nYou know that you can't use items\nin here, right?\c\nAren't you and your Pokémon starting to\nget a bit tired?\c\nIf you are, seek out a Nurse!\c\nJust talk to one of them, and the\nNurse should recover your Pokémon.\c\nYou'll have to have a battle\nfirst, though.\c\nWell, I'm going on ahead.\nDon't keep me waiting too long!\c
You're doing well!\nI knew you would make it this far.\c\nHere, I'll give you another hint.\c\nWhen you've lost your way!\c\nWhen your Pokémon are feeling down!\c\nWhen you want to leave immediately!\c\nDo you ever have times like those?\c\nWell, this book will certainly come\nin handy, then!\c\nIt's called “Adventure Rules for\nUnova's Challenge"!\c\nIt says here, “Press the X Button to\nmake the RETIRE button appear.

This area is no problem, right?\c\nFor you guys.\c\nI mean, you have your Pokémon with you.\c\nRight! Keep on going with your Pokémon!\c\nI'll be waiting for you higher up!\c
This area is no problem, right?\c\nFor you guys.\c\nI mean, you have your Pokémon with you.\c\nRight! Keep on going with your Pokémon!\c\nI'll be waiting for you down below!\c

If you'd like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\c
...Oh?\nYou don't need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat's a tall order even for me!
I see, I see...\c\nThis Pokémon's potential is\ndecent all around.\c\nThat's my determination, and it's final.\c
I see, I see...\c\nThis Pokémon's potential is\nabove average overall.\c\nThat's my determination, and it's final.\c

Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its HP.\c

Its Sp. Atk stat\nis equally good.\c
Its Sp. Def stat\nis good as well.\c
Well, its Speed stat\nis also good.\c
It's rather decent in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It's very good in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.

Welcome to the Pokémon Musical!\c\nThis is a changing room for Dress Up only.\nWould you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
This way, please!\c
Would you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
What would you like me to explain?
What's the Pokémon Musical?
The Pokémon Musical is a show where\nPokémon wearing Props perform on stage.\r\nAnyone can participate!\c\nWe encourage all Trainers to show the\nworld how charming their Pokémon are!\c\nThe audience is looking forward to seeing\nhow you Dress Up your Pokémon, and how\r\nyour Pokémon perform!\c
How to Participate
You can join the musical from any of the\nthree reception areas.\c\nThe reception area in the center is for\nparticipating alone.\c\nWhen you participate alone, you will\nbe joined by other Trainers from around\r\nthe Unova region.\c\nIf you want to put on a musical with your\nfriends, go to the left reception area.\c\nYou'll be asked to pick a Leader who\nwill choose which show to perform,\r\nand the others will join the group.\c\nThe reception area to the right is where\nyou go to Dress Up only.\c
Eligible Pokémon
The Pokémon that will participate in the\nmusical are chosen from your party at\r\nthe reception area.\c\nBecause of their shape, some Pokémon\nhave a hard time wearing certain Props.\c\nYou might want to try Dress Up in the\nchanging room first if you're worried!\c
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part! That's\nwhere you put the Props you've collected\r\non the Pokémon that will be performing.\c\nDepending on the Pokémon, you can put\nthe Props in different places.\c\nWhen you use Props that fit the theme of\nthe show you've chosen, the audience\r\nwill notice your Pokémon more!\c\nSometimes a Prop that doesn't fit the\ntheme will also make your Pokémon\r\nstand out.\c\nIf you want to get an idea of how it's\ndone, you can watch how other people\r\nDress Up and then try it yourself!\c
Shows
You can choose which show to perform\nwhen you participate in the musical.\c\nThere is no need for Trainers to give\ncommands, but if your Pokémon is carrying\r\na Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop\r\nto show off and appeal to the audience.\c\nDepending on how you Dress Up your\nPokémon, the reactions from the audience\r\nwill change!\c

[VAR BE09(0001)]Then, one day, a man appeared\nbefore me, claiming to be my father.\c\nThat...was Ghetsis.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c

[VAR BE09(0001)]I'll be outside...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c

[VAR BE09(0001)]Accepting different ideas...\c\nI want to see if you're a Trainer whose\nheart is strong enough to do that.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c

Which Pokémon's nickname\nshould I critique?\c
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)], is it?\c\nThat sounds good! It's a very “you"\nsort of name.\c\nBut if you'd like to change it, I can help\nyou do that. How about it?
Excellent! What would you like\nthe new nickname to be?\c
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nYou're right, that does seem to fit it\nbetter. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you\nchange your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we\nboth know this name is vastly superior!\r\nHow fortunate for you!

Cilan: Chili, are you listening to me?\c\nWe have to study hard\nand become full-fledged Gym Leaders\r\nas soon as possible...\c
Chili: About that.\c\nIf we had gone to N's Castle a year\nago, the Seven Sages and the\r\nShadow Triad wouldn't have escaped!\c\nThen, nobody would say something like\n“Three of you together make..."\c
Cress: I guess you're right.\c
Cilan: You think so?\nBut it isn't that big of a deal.\c\nWe may not have made it in time,\nbut Team Plasma is still gone.\c
Chili: Argh!\c\nIt's because you say things like that.\nThat's why people treat us like a joke!\c\nLike it takes all three of us together\nto make one great Trainer!\c
Cress: You're overthinking it,\nbut I can't say the possibility is zero.\c
Cilan: Come on, you two...\c\nDon't you think it's a bit strange\nto get recognition and respect as\r\nGym Leaders just for beating bad guys?\c
Chili: I understand what you're saying.\c\nBut if things go on like this,\nnothing will ever change.\c\nEven if we train, the other Gym Leaders\nwill become that much stronger as well.\c
???: Then...\nWe'll battle you.\c
Cress: Based on your appearance,\nyou must be the Shadow Triad.\r\nBut why are you here?\c
Shadow Triad: We came on a whim...\c\nTo vent...\c\nTo pass time...\c\nIt doesn't matter.\c
Chili: Three on three!\c\nThe first one to beat them\nis the strongest among us!\c
Shadow Triad: Too easy...\c
Shadow Triad: These three aren't worth\nworrying about.\c\nWe must focus on the other\nGym Leaders so that next time\r\nthey won't get in our way...\c
Shadow Triad: Well...\nLord Ghetsis is waiting.\c\nWe must catch that Pokémon.\c
Chili: C'mon!\c\nWhat was that?\nCome back here and say that again!\c
Cilan: I mean...\nThey were overwhelmingly strong.\c
Cress: We have to admit it.\c\nThe three Leaders of Striaton City\nmake one full-fledged Trainer.\c
Cilan: You're right.\c\nChili. Cress.\c\nI think as long as the three of us\nact like the Gym Leaders we are now,\r\nnothing will ever change.\c
Chili: I didn't think\nyou would be the first to say that.\c
Cress: Of course, I, Cress,\nwas thinking about that, too.\c
Cilan: All right.\c\nLet's resign as Gym Leaders\nand start our training over\r\nfrom the ground up.\c\nThen, I'm sure one of us\nwill become a Trainer\r\neveryone recognizes as great.\c
Chili: We're triplets.\nWhat we think is the same.\c\nSo we just have to become\nas strong as each other,\r\nand then we can be\r\nGym Leaders together again!\c
Cress: OK. So as for the replacement\nGym Leader...\c

Lenora: Why hello, Burgh.\c\nWhat's up?\nSuffering from artist's block again?\c
Burgh: Hmm...\nBones, perhaps...\c
Lenora: Bones...?\c\nThis is a museum,\nso of course we have bones.\c\nWhat are you looking for?\nYour next motif?\c
Burgh: Maybe...\c\nOr maybe not...\c\nMany Bug-type Pokémon have\nhard coverings, right?\r\nTheir so-called exoskeletons.\c\nSo I don't quite understand bones.\nNot at all, actually.\c
Lenora: So, did you think you would\nunderstand something about bones\r\nif you came here?\c\nSure thing!\nMake yourself at home!\c\nIf you'd like, I can have my husband\nexplain them to you.\c
Burgh: Mmm...\c\nWell, for starters, what do bones\nmean to you?\c
Lenora: When I was little, my dad\nworked in a mine, and he would always\r\nbring home bones he dug up.\c\nI was just a child, but I was brought\nunder the spell of bones.\c\nWhat did the bones look like\nwhen they were part of a living being?\c\nWhy are they shaped the way they are?\nThings like that captivated me.\c
Burgh: Oohhh...\nI kind of understand.\c\nI'm also fascinated by the functional,\nefficient designs of Bug-type Pokémon,\r\nsuch as the shape of their legs.\c
???: Hey there!\nWhat's everyone all gathered up for?\c
Burgh: What brings you here?\c
Clay: Found a Fossil\nin Twist Mountain.\c\nI came to have Lenora look at it and see\nif ya wanted to keep it here or somethin'.\c
Burgh: Clay.\nWhat do bones mean to you?\c
Clay: Hmm?\nWell now...\c\nNo matter who ya are or when ya die,\nbones are all that'll be left of ya.\c\nWhen ya think about it, it's amazin'.\nEven if ya die, ya can make money!\r\nSome Fossils are worth a lot, ya know!\c
Lenora: I can't tell if you're kidding,\nbut of course you would think that way.\c\nBurgh is trying hard to think\nabout what bones mean to him.\c\nDon't be so flippant!\c\nSo what kind of Fossil have you got\nthere? Let me see.\c
Clay: Here ya go!\c\nWhaddaya think?\c\nIt's gotta be worth a mint\nas a specimen or as a collectible!\r\nWhich is it?\c
Lenora: Well, I mean this in a good way,\nbut it's an ordinary Fossil.\c\nIf it isn't worth much as a specimen,\nyou can't sell it for much.\c\nBut I'm curious about the soil\nattached to the Fossil...\c
Burgh: What do you mean?\c
Lenora: It's very subtle,\nbut it's a bit different from the soil\r\nI usually see from Twist Mountain.\c
Clay: That so?\c\nGuess my Twist Mountain\nstill has unlimited potential!\c\nAll right!\nI'll keep on diggin' my Clay Tunnel!\c
Here, Burgh!\c\nThat plain ol' Fossil's yours!\c\nHave a look at it\nand think about what bones mean to ya.\c
Burgh: Thank you, Lenora.\c\nI guess it's OK that I have\nmy own perspective on what\r\nbones mean to me, right?\c
Lenora: Why not?\c\nYou, me, Clay...\nWe all have a different way of thinking\r\nabout what bones mean to us.\c\nIt would be kind of creepy if we all felt\nthe exact same way, right?\c\nAnyway, I feel sorry for this Fossil.\c\nIt's just resting, minding its own\nbusiness, and everyone is saying\r\nthis and that about it.\c
Burgh: I know.\c\nI'll thank this Fossil\nby using it as a motif\r\nfor one of my works.\c\nSee you, Lenora.\c

Leaving the Prop Case behind...\nHuh. Did [VAR 0100(0000)] do that\r\naccidentally or on purpose?\c\nWhatever the reason, there's no doubt\nthat [VAR 0100(0000)] had a great talent\r\nfor coordinating Pokémon Props!\c
Open the Prop Case--and voilà!\nColorful Props for Pokémon!\c\nAw, yeah! It is time to play Dress Up!\c
The Top Hat is an elegant Prop that\nadds class to any Pokémon's head!\c
How about popping some cute\nBlue Barrettes on a Pokémon's ears?\c
The Square Glasses are eye catching.\nThey nicely frame a Pokémon's face!\c
Maraca, Maraca, Maraca!\nIt's a sharp look for a Pokémon's arm.\c
The Umber Belt accentuates a waistline!\nBelts are decorative as well as useful.\c
Putting a Tie on a Pokémon's body makes\nit look dignified or charming--or both!\c
There's nothing to worry about.\c\nIf [VAR 0100(0000)] comes back, we'll return\nthis trusty Prop Case in a trice.\c

Grunt 2: Of course,\nthat was disgusting.\c\nBut even if you live honestly,\nI'm telling you, the world is cold.\c\nAs if you were surrounded by Cryogonal.\c
Grunt 1: Yeah, you're right.\c\nIt has flaws, but\nTeam Plasma is Team Plasma.\c
Grunt 2: Don't you think we could have\ngone to a region far away?\c\nOrganizations like Team Plasma\nmust exist everywhere.\r\nWe might have gotten favorable treatment\r\nbecause of our experience!\c
Grunt 1: Stupid, stupid, stupid!\c\nAnd did I mention stupid?\c\nIt all adds up to nincompoop!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!\nOwwwww!\c
Grunt 1: We have to do something\nfor Pokémon. Did you forget that?\c
Grunt 2: Honestly, I'm sorry.\c\nBut Pokémon have a hard time, too.\nDon't you think?\c\nOnce they are in Poké Balls, that's it...\c\nThat might happen. Still, do they really\nlike their Trainers?\c
Grunt 1: Yeah!\c\nBut Lord N was listening to such feelings\nand words from Pokémon...\c\nJust imagining it\ncan break my heart.\c
Grunt 2: Lord N...\nI wonder where he is...\c\nNow, let's go find the Pokémon\nin N's Castle.\r\nWe have to protect them.\c
N: [VAR BE09(0001)]I'm here, though...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]I've been worried about\nthe people who believed in me...\c\nBut it seems they know\nwhat they can do for Pokémon\r\nin their own ways.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Compared to them...\nWhat was I doing?\c\nWhat I really should have done was\ntell people about how Pokémon feel...![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]The legendary Dragon-type\nPokémon knew that.\c\nIt has lived long\nand known many people.\c\nIt knew humans and Pokémon have lived\nand will live together.\c\nIt knew that in this relationship,\nhumans' actions have an enormous impact\r\non Pokémon.\c\nThat's why it helps the one\nwho searches for truth...\r\nthe one who opens the way to the future.[VAR BE09(0000)]\c

[VAR BE09(0001)]It's not necessary...\c\nSeparating black from white\nand humans from Pokémon!\c\nIf you think in terms of each\nindividual life, this world was in a state\r\nthat couldn't be divided any further.\c\nPossibilities are born out of\ncombining and fusing these\r\ndifferent lives!\c\nThere are some things we can\nunderstand only by doing this.\c\nIt will give form to unseen things.\c\nThese formulae will restructure\nthe world and make it richer![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]From their Poké Balls, I can hear the\nmany different feelings Pokémon have\r\nabout their Trainers!\c\nMore than anything, I can hear their joy\nthat they met people who need them!\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]I'll go...\c\nFor Pokémon,\nfor Trainers,\r\nand for all lives...\c\nAnd for my friends\nwho saved me![VAR BE09(0000)]\c

Iris: Yay! I did it!\nHaxorus, thank you!\r\nI won because of you!\c
Drayden: Well done, Iris.\c
Iris: What did you want\nto talk to me about, Grandpa?\c
Drayden: Ah yes...\nI was thinking about the past.\c\nI traveled all over the world\nlooking for a successor.\c\nI even went to remote places\nsuch as the Village of Dragons.\c\nThat's where I met you, Iris.\c
Iris: Yep!\nI was the strongest!\c
Drayden: Yes.\nI was surprised.\c\nYou were one with your Pokémon\nand battling with so much joy.\c\nJust watching you made me smile.\c\nYour opponents felt disappointed by\ntheir defeat, but at the same time\r\nthey enjoyed the battle.\c\nIt was completely natural for me\nto decide I wanted to make you\r\nmy successor.\c
Iris: I'm so glad I came to Unova!\c\nThere are many different people\nand so many different Pokémon!\c\nAnd you know what...\c\nIn the Village of Dragons, people take\nliving alongside Pokémon for granted.\c\nI was surprised some people\nin Unova didn't think that way!\c
Drayden: I found your reactions\nto be a breath of fresh air.\c\nAnd as a condition to leave the\nVillage of Dragons, you wanted\r\nto broaden your experiences\r\nand become the Champion...\c\nSo as I promised,\nI've been training you as a Trainer\r\nand as a Gym Leader.\c\nAn order directly from Alder\ncame as I was training you.\c
Iris: Alder was smiling, though.\c
Drayden: He lost to N\nand retrained himself.\c\nHe asked me to help him with his special\ntraining, but it was ghastly.\c\nHe wanted to become an immense\nobstacle for you, the new Champion...\c\nFor that alone, he pushed himself\nincredibly hard.\c
Iris: Alder was really, really strong!\c\nAnd even when I felt a bit weak,\nhe encouraged us!\c\nHe said that even when their backs\nare against the wall, my Pokémon\r\nhave an intense look in their eyes.\c\nSo, that's why I won, but I feel\nlike I still have a lot to learn.\c
Drayden: Don't forget that feeling.\c\nAnd now, if I may change the subject...\c\nWhen you came to Opelucid City,\nI gave you those clothes, right?\c
You're the Champion, now.\nIt's all right to dress up a little.\c
Iris: Are these new clothes?\nOK. I'll change into them right now!\c
Iris: Wooow!\nIt's such a flowing dress!\c
Drayden: What is important is\nyour mental preparation\r\nas the Champion, Iris.\c
When I was little,\nPoké Balls didn't exist yet.\c\nSometimes Pokémon would run away\nfrom awful Trainers who didn't try\r\nto understand them.\c
Iris: But you were fine, right?\c\nI can tell!\c\nYour Haxorus loves you very much!\c
I've already decided!\nI know what kind of Champion I will be!\c\nThere's a myth in Sinnoh that says\nthe reason why Pokémon jump out\r\nis because they want to thank people.\c\nI'm sure that we and Pokémon have helped\neach other and enriched the world\r\nsince ancient times.\c\nThese memories have been engraved in\neach Pokémon's heart!\c\nSo, I want Pokémon and people\nto get closer and closer!\c\nAs the Champion,\nI want to tell that to everybody!\c
Drayden: Good!\nIf anyone can do it, you can.\c

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]I can't...\c\nI just can't keep Pokémon\nconfined in Poké Balls!\c\nAlso, if they stay with their Trainers,\nPokémon will battle,\r\nand they will be hurt...\c\nEven if it is for changing the\nworld to protect Pokémon...\c\nIt's too hard for me to put\nthem through such pain...[VAR BE09(0000)]\c

N: [VAR BE09(0001)]Not yet!\nThe world hasn't changed yet!\c\nThe time to free your Pokémon\nwill be when I befriend the Unova region's\r\nlegendary Dragon-type Pokémon,\r\nsurpass the Champion,\r\nand become the hero![VAR BE09(0000)]\c

[VAR BE09(0001)]The cries of the suffering\nPokémon filling that room...\c\nThe borderline between Pokémon\nand humans...\c\nI exist on that line.\nI live in the margins between everyone,\r\nso I will save them!\r\nI will change the world!\c\nAnd to that end, I must\nfight to the finish with [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR BE09(0000)]\c

A sophisticated joke!\c
How should I put it...\c\nMy looks suggest that\nI'm not a lot of fun.\c\nBut I'll tear down that mistaken\nimage with my own hands!\c\nI'll say something silly and give someone\nan opportunity to call me out,\r\nso we can all have a good laugh!\c

I see!
Yes.
Mmmh!
Well then...
Looking forward to it.
Sensei!\nYou called?\c
Alder: You're looking well!\c
Marshal: Hey, I heard you're\ngoing back to acting!\c
Brycen: Indeed!\c\nTeam Plasma's actions\nstirred the hearts of the public.\c\nPeople even worry about\nhow to interact with Pokémon.\c\nOf course, it's good to think\nabout that relationship, but still...\c
Alder: Even if you're told to find\nan answer on your own...\c\nIt's not exactly an easy thing\nto do now, is it?\c
Brycen: That's why...\c\nIf people can see my bond with my Pokémon\nwhen they're watching my movies,\r\nit might ease their worries...\c\nThat was my reasoning...\c
Marshal: Oh! I get it now!\c\nCan't communicate that just\nby holing up in the Gym and\r\ntalking to challengers.\c\nBut, are you gonna be all right?\nWhat if you get hurt during filming again?\c
Alder: Marshal...\nBrycen has already decided.\c\nSometimes worrying can\ndestroy potential.\c
Brycen: I'm fine.\nI have no doubts about my decision.\c\nAlso, I appreciate Marshal's concern.\c
I was young...\c\nI thought I could do\nany kind of action scene.\c\nSo I would put myself in\nunnecessary danger.\c\nI thought this bravery was\nmy value as a person.\c
So... Instead of trying to communicate\nsomething through my acting,\r\nI simply sought amazing action.\c\nThat was how I got hurt.\c
Marshal: I think I understand.\c\nIf you seek strength for its own sake,\nthe reason why you wanted it\r\nin the first place becomes vague.\c\nAnd you end up desiring\nvictory and nothing else.\c
Alder: That's why I've also made\nan important decision.\c\nI'm going to resign as Champion!\c
We in particular need to take another\nlook at what it means to live together\r\nwith Pokémon.\c\nThe world at large is still shaken\nby uncertainty.\c\nSo I have to show everyone\na new hope.\c
Marshal: Well, if that's what\nyou've decided, Sensei.\c\nEven if I argue, that won't\nchange your decision, will it?\c
Alder: You've grown so much since you\nsought me out and asked to be my pupil.\c\nCould that be it?\c\nDid becoming part of the Elite Four\nhelp you grow up in its own way?\c
Marshal: I thought that if I were strong,\nmy Pokémon would become stronger.\c\nMaybe I grew up because my Pokémon\ntaught me that this isn't always\r\nthe case...\c\nWell then, will you spar with me?\c
Brycen: I will observe.\c
Alder: Thank you.\c\nI want to be sure my Pokémon are in\ntop condition to challenge the Trainer\r\nwho will become the next Champion.\c
Alder: To strength!\c
Marshal: To Pokémon!\c

W-w-what? You!\nYou have all the Gym Badges?!\c
Great!\nYou may be able to...\c
Professor Paaaaaark!\c
Quick, quick!\c
Oh, there you are!\c
Professor!\c\nDo you have a minute?\nI think you do. Listen!\c\nThis kid is a Trainer who has all the\nGym Badges. All of them!\c\nI am sure this Trainer can operate it!\c
I have told you many times.\c\nThis invention is great indeed, but\nwithout a professional Trainer...\c
What? You have the Gym Badges?\nALL of them?!\c
Fantastic!\c\nFantastico!\c
Yahoooooooooooooooo!\c
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable!\nHi, I am Professor Andrew Park!\c\nYou!\nEr...\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you willing to\nparticipate in an ambitious experiment\r\nthat will make history?\c\nThis device is called Poké Transfer.\c\nIt connects...blah blah blah...\n...called DS system...meanwhile...\c\n...blah blah...of molecules...and then...\n...while evoking...blah blah...\c\n...ergo, energy particles will...\n...blah blah...and if the frequency...\c\n...as you see...with faraway Pokémon...\n...the Alpha waves...blah blah...\c\n...following which...reach convergence...\n...blah blah...spectacular results!\c
To put it more simply, if you use this\ndevice, you may be able to bring Pokémon\r\nhere from other regions.\c\nBut just for safety's sake, the Pokémon\nyou're transferring shouldn't be holding\r\nanything! So make sure to take their\r\nitems first.\c
...So! You!\c
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer!\c\nWill you participate in the great\nexperiment of the century?\c\nYou need two DS systems to use\nPoké Transfer!\c\nWe will conduct the experiment with\nanother DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when\nyou transfer them. It's safer that way.\c\nIn rare cases, there are Pokémon that\ncannot be transferred, but\r\nProfessor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to\nhave an impact on people in the future...\r\npeople living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer.\c\nWe're keeping a careful eye to make sure\nall the Pokémon have safe travels!

Remember me if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move,\nso it can't be forgotten...\c
What? That's an Egg.\nNo Egg should know any moves.\c
OK, then.\nWhich move should be forgotten?\c
Hm! The move [VAR 0107(0000)]?\nShould that move be forgotten?
It worked perfectly!\c\nYour Pokémon has forgotten the move\n[VAR 0107(0000)] completely.
                    
                
                           
                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                
                          
                            
                          
                               
                     
Which move should\n[VAR 0102(0000)] remember?\c
Should the move [VAR 0107(0001)]\nbe remembered?
Give up trying to make\n[VAR 0102(0000)] remember a move?
[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered the move\n[VAR 0107(0001)] it had forgotten!\c
[VAR 0102(0000)] wants to remember\nthe move [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nBut [VAR 0102(0000)] can't learn more\nthan four moves.\c\nDelete an existing move to make\nroom for [VAR 0107(0001)]?
1, [VAR BE02(0014)]2, and[VAR BE02(0014)]... [VAR BE02(0014)]... [VAR BE02(0014)]... Ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0005)]\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] forgot how to\nuse [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nAnd...\c
[VAR 0102(0000)] remembered the move\n[VAR 0107(0001)] it had forgotten!\c
Give up on making the Pokémon\nremember [VAR 0107(0001)]?
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not remember the\nmove [VAR 0107(0001)].\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over one\nHeart Scale in exchange.
Is it OK to forget the\nmove [VAR 0107(0000)]?
Everybody calls me the reminder girl.\c\nI know every move that Pokémon learn\nwhile they're leveling up.\c\nAnd I can make Pokémon remember\nthose moves!\c\nIf you bring me a Heart Scale, I'll make\na Pokémon remember a move.\c
Should a move be remembered?
Which Pokémon should learn it?\c
If any of your Pokémon needs to\nremember a move, bring me a Heart Scale!
Eggs can't remember moves!
This Pokémon hasn't forgotten\nany moves.

We don't raise little ones,\nwe help them grow.\c\nThat's what I think, and the Day-Care\nCouple next door feels the same.
Are you aware of the Pokémon Ability\nFlame Body?
Impressive! I often see\nVolcarona on Route 3!
OK! Listen to this, then.\c\nWhen a Pokémon with the Flame Body\nAbility is with you, Eggs hatch faster!
Nice guys from Striaton City\ngave this preschool its Pokémon!

Hey, Trainer!\c\nThese boulders suddenly\nlined up like this...\c\nWhat's more, the HM Strength\nwon't budge them.
I never would have guessed\nthey were Crustle...\c\nIf you're interested in Crustle,\nyou'll find them in the Desert Resort,\r\nwhich is just past here!
It's a big boulder, but it doesn't\nlook like a Pokémon can move it...
Colress: I've been waiting for you!\c\nWhat's the matter?\nInterested in what's behind me?\c
These are not mere rocks, but\nthe Pokémon known as Crustle.\c\nObserve.\c\nWith this device I created\nto energize Pokémon, I'll...\c
      
Colress: Those Crustle...\c\nWere they just lying here,\nout of energy, with their\r\nboulders on their backs?\c
Team Plasma said we should recognize\nthe potential in Pokémon and\r\nliberate them from humans.\c\nI disagree.\c\nConversely, it should be humans who bring\nout the hidden potential in Pokémon!\c
Now that I think of it,\nI never asked your name.\c\n...\n...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI'll remember that name.\c\nWell then, I will test you to see if\nyou're a Trainer who can bring out\r\nthe hidden potential of Pokémon!\c
Colress: I see! Just like the\nGym Leaders in each area or the\r\nElite Four and Champion in the\r\nPokémon League, you bring out the\r\npower in Pokémon by being kind to them!\c\nThat's the kind of person you are.\c\nI'm extremely grateful for your help.\nThis is a token of my gratitude.\c
Colress: It's so frustrating!\c\nIf only we could talk to Pokémon\nin order to bring out their power!\c\nBut there's no way a person\nlike that could ever exist!\c\nWell then, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI hope to see you again sometime.\c

I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nI wanted to get the attention of a girl\nI like, so I mastered a new style of\r\nPokémon battling called Triple Battle.\c\nWant to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is\nreally hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three\nPokémon at a time and battle!\c\nThe rules are simple: just make all of\nyour opponent's Pokémon faint.\c\nAnd that's a rough explanation\nof Triple Battles.\c
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nHey! If you're a Trainer, how about a\nTriple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!\c\nI'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.\c\nI'm always at full throttle.\c

In Rotation Battles, you send out three\nPokémon at a time and battle!\c\nOne Pokémon takes the lead position,\nand the other two stand on each side.\c\nThe trick is, each turn you can change\ntheir positions...\c\nAnd that's a rough explanation\nof Rotation Battles.\c

Because it's a battle, one person has\nto win and one person has to lose.\c\nI wish my boyfriend could just enjoy\nthe battle and not worry about losing.\r\nSometimes he gets too serious.
There seems to be a lot to think about,\nbut it looks really fun!
Battling with three Pokémon.\nThat itself makes me very excited!
Triple Battle and\nRotation Battle...\c\nThere are various styles of\nPokémon battling.
The Trainer called Charles\nis quite tough to beat.\c\nIf you have four Gym Badges,\nyou might be a match for him.
There are so many different Pokémon,\nit's difficult to decide which ones\r\nto battle with.
There are a lot of Pokémon.\nSo I like this!
Looking at this kind of battle\nmakes me curious about the\r\nPokémon World Tournament.\r\nI hear it will be held in Driftveil City.
Hi, Trainer! Will you buy the Berries\nI gathered?\c\nFive [VAR 0109(0000)] for just $200!\nYou want them. You'll buy them, right?

Elderly Man: It's the legendary Pokémon\ncalled Cobalion!\c\nI told you the story the other\nday, right?\c
Rood: Oh, Cobalion!\nWhat a noble presence!\c
Elderly Man: They say the three Pokémon\nCobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion\r\nfought against people to protect\r\nPokémon from the war those\r\npeople started...\c
When people fight, there's no peace for\nPokémon, either.\c\nThe three legends learned that\nthe deeds of humans could lead\r\nto dire consequences for their world.\c
But... Why did it show up\nin front of people?\c
Is it patrolling the Unova region\nto protect Pokémon because it fears for\r\ntheir safety after the commotion caused\r\nby Team Plasma two years ago?\c\nOr does it sense a new problem...?\c
Rood: Unforgivable...\c\nSo the reach of Ghetsis's ambition\nand malice is growing ever wider and\r\nwarping the lives of all it touches...\c
Did Cobalion appear in front of you\nmerely by accident?\c\nOr to plead with you to solve a problem?\c\nUnlike Lord N, I don't have the ability\nto understand the minds of Pokémon.\c\nTherefore, I don't know\nwhat that Pokémon is thinking.\c\nBut if you can befriend Cobalion,\nit will be a great asset to you\r\non your journey.

They say the Reveal Glass brings\nThundurus, Tornadus, and Landorus\r\nback to their original appearance.\c\nHowever, I don't know whether\nIncarnate Forme or Therian Forme\r\nis the true Forme.\c
Why do delicious vegetables grow in the\nfields of Mistralton City?\c\nIt's because the ones who grow them are\nvery picky about the mulch they use.\c\nIt's good mulch. Strong mulch. It's\nstored up a lot of energy from nature.\r\nAnd that makes it really stinky!\c\nSuch a powerful aroma! It burns\nall the way to the back of your nose!\c\nAww. Just remembering it\nmakes me dizzy!\c
The Funfest Mission\n“[VAR 0140(0000)]"\r\nhas been added to the Entralink.
Stinky, stinky mulch\ngrows delicious vegetables!
So you know what Landorus is like\nwhen it means business, huh?\c
Yeah! I do!\c\nIt changes into another Forme\nand flies around the sky!\c\nTornadus and Thundurus\nchange Formes, too!\r\n...Well, that's the story, anyway.
Yeah! I do!\c\nIt changes into another Forme\nand flies around the sky!\c\nThundurus and Tornadus\nchange Formes, too!\r\n...Well, that's the story, anyway.
That's good, then!\c\n...You know, I've only heard\nabout it in stories, too.
                                                                                                        
                                                                        
           
This little shrine is dedicated to a\nPokémon called Landorus.\c\nThey say that when Tornadus and\nThundurus were whipping up storms that\r\ndamaged houses and fields all over the\r\nUnova region, Landorus made them stop.\c\nThat's a story from when my\ngrandpa was just a little kid!
                              
                                              
                
It's a small, weathered shrine.

I see. If that's the case,\nyou must have the power to protect\r\nyour own Pokémon!\c\nBeing protected by Pokémon\nalone doesn't make you a Trainer!\c\nIt's because Trainers are strong,\nbecause they care about their Pokémon,\r\nthat these Pokémon can also be strong!\c\nHere!\nThis is from me!\c

Iris: Guess what!!\c\nI can teach you the strongest\nDragon-type move!\c\nFun, huh? Want me to\nteach your Pokémon this move?
OK! Well, if you change your mind,\ncome again, OK?
Let me see...\c\nWell, this Pokémon can learn the move,\nbut you need to have a really strong\r\nbond of friendship first.\c\nI don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great!\nOh, but...\c\nYou don't seem to have a\nPokémon that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which Pokémon should\nlearn this move?\c
Um... I'm sorry...\nThat Pokémon can't learn this move!
What?\c\nYou want me to teach the move to an Egg?\nOK, I'll do my best!\c\n...\n...\c\nSorry!\nI think it's impossible!
This one?\c\nUm, but...it looks like this Pokémon\nalready knows [VAR 0107(0000)].
Iris: Draco Meteor's power is\nreally amazing!\c\nBut after you use it, your Sp. Atk stat\ngoes down.

Drayden: If you wish, I can teach your\nPokémon the strongest\r\nDragon-type move.\c\nWould you like your Pokémon to learn\nthat move?
Understood.\nCome again if you change your mind.
Hmm...\c\nThis Pokémon can learn this move, but\nyour bond of friendship is not yet\r\nstrong enough.\c\nThat means I cannot teach\nit this move.
I see...\c\nBut there are no Pokémon with\nyou right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should\nlearn this move?\c
I'm very sorry, but...\c\nThis Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but...\nNot even I can teach a move to an Egg.
Hmm... It looks like this Pokémon\nalready knows [VAR 0107(0000)].
Drayden: Draco Meteor's power is\nexceptional, but using it lowers\r\nthe user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought\nyou here...\c\nVery well.\c\nLet me reward your passion with some\nabsolutely astounding moves.\c\nThey're the ultimate moves!\c\nShall I teach them to\nyour Pokémon?

Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well.\nVisit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which Pokémon should I teach?\c
That Pokémon can't learn a move!\nGo talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg?\nImpossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your Pokémon\nis not strong enough! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows\nthat move! Keh!
I should teach [VAR 0107(0001)] to\n[VAR 0101(0000)], right? Keh!
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Heya!\c\nThe professor gave you a Pokémon to\nstart your journey, right?\c\nIf that Pokémon is still with you, and if\nyou two have a strong bond, there's a\r\nspecial move it can learn...\c\nWant me to teach it a battle-combo move?
A special move...\nShould I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so...\nWell, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?\c
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this\nspecial move!\c\nI told ya, it's only for the Pokémon who\nstarted your journey with you.
Teach a move to an Egg?\nWhat kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look\nlike it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon\nalready knows the special move!
Want me to teach [VAR 0107(0001)]\nto [VAR 0101(0000)]?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are\nthe ones you get from the professor!\c\nTo teach all of these Pokémon a\nspecial move, a battle-combo move...\r\nThat's my pledge!
I'm the master Move Tutor!\c\nAnd I'm also obsessed with\n[VAR 0109(0000)]!\c\nGive me [VAR 0109(0000)],\nand I'll thank you by teaching\r\nyour Pokémon a move!\c

Do you like Pokémon?
Yes, yes, you have Pokémon with you,\nso I'm sure you do!
That so? Then why are you\non a journey with Pokémon?
Now, I wonder which person\nwas the first person in the\r\nworld to get along with Pokémon...

Sorry to bother you, but I like low\nplaces like this and little tiny things.\c\nTiny Pokémon are the most interesting!\c\nI particularly like Pokémon that have a\nheight of eight inches or less.\c\nBy the way...\nDo you have any tiny Pokémon?\c\nIf you do, could you show me?
Will you show me a tiny Pokémon?
Wow! Amazing!\n[VAR 0101(0000)] is so tiny!\c\nI wonder what it would feel like\nto become [VAR 0101(0000)]...\c\nI bet I'd get a way different outlook\non life...\c\nJust imagining it gets me excited!\nTiny things are super interesting!
Hm...\c\nYou don't even have a teensy\nnumber of tiny Pokémon.\c\nI'd sure like to see a Pokémon\nthat's eight inches high or smaller...
Thanks for showing me a tiny Pokémon!\nIt was super interesting!\c\nI'd sure like it if you'd\nshow me one again tomorrow...
You know what?!\c\nI love high places like this,\nand really big things!\c\nMy favorite Pokémon\nare big ones, too!\c\nWhat I mean by big, you know,\nis being more than 17 feet tall!\c\nC'mon! If you have a big\nPokémon, show it to me!
Have you come to show me a big Pokémon?
Wow! Amazing!\n[VAR 0101(0000)] is sooooo big!\c\nRiding on top of [VAR 0101(0000)]\nwould be so much fun!\c\nWhen you look from high places, you can\nsee rooftops and faraway mountains\r\nand other things you usually can't see.\c\nThat's why I like big things so much!
What?!\nNo big Pokémon for me?\c\nI wanna see a Pokémon\nbigger than 17 feet!
Big thanks for showing me a big Pokémon!\c\nI'd be even more happy if you'd show me\none tomorrow, too!

Wow! A Pokémon!\nHow cool! I'm so jealous!\c\nHa ha! Just kidding!\nI'm a Pokémon Trainer now!\c\nJust like the Trainer from\nNuvema I met two years ago!

I hear a Pokémon called Whismur\nhas a very quiet cry.\c\nIf I knew what it sounded like,\nI could play perfect pianissimo!
The cry of that Whismur with you...\c\nIt's wonderfully pianissimo!\nIt reverberates like a sweet murmur!
Thanks to you and your Pokémon,\nmy mind is overflowing with melodies!\c\nI can play the piano again!\c

Bianca: Hee hee!\c\nI used Fly, so it looks like\nI beat you here.\c\nThanks for your help\nin Reversal Mountain!\c
Professor Juniper: If you go straight\npast Lacunosa Town, you'll reach\r\nOpelucid City!\c\nBut before you go, there's something\nI want you two to hear.\c
Bianca: What is it?\c
Professor Juniper: You'll know soon\nenough. Hurry now!\c
You must be the ones who want to hear\nthat old tale about Lacunosa Town.
Professor Juniper: That's right.\nPlease tell us.\c
All right, my dearies.\nPlease come in.\c
Professor Juniper: This is the place!\c
Professor Juniper: Wasn't that\nan interesting folktale?\c\nThe Pokémon's true identity may be\nunknown, but the power mentioned\r\nin the story is incredible!\c
Bianca: I know...\c\nThe power to freeze everything around it\ncould even rival the power of the\r\nlegendary Dragon-type Pokémon.\c
Yes, Bianca.\c\nIt's almost like Zekrom, who scorched\nUnova with intense lightning long ago.\c
Yes, Bianca.\c\nIt's almost like Reshiram, who scorched\nUnova with blazing fire long ago.\c
By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)],\ndo you remember the story of Zekrom?
By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)],\ndo you remember the story of Reshiram?
I told you a little about it in\nLentimas Town, remember?\c\nZekrom is a legendary Dragon-type\nPokémon that lends its power to the\r\nperson it recognizes as a hero\r\npursuing ideals.\c\nIt has a black body, and it can\nunleash fearsome lightning!\c
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI even told you a little about\nit in Lentimas Town.\c\nZekrom is a legendary Dragon-type\nPokémon that lends its power to the\r\nperson it recognizes as a hero\r\npursuing ideals.\c\nIt has a black body, and it can\nunleash fearsome lightning!\c
So you remember I told you a little\nabout it in Lentimas Town!\c\nReshiram is a legendary Dragon-type\nPokémon that lends its power to the\r\nperson it recognizes as a hero who\r\nseeks truth.\c\nIt has a white body, and it can send\nforth ferocious flames!\c

Bianca: Professor, do you think\nthere's a connection between\r\nthe Pokémon from the old story\r\nand the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon?\c
Professor Juniper: The meteorite.\c
Bianca: The meteorite?\c
Zekrom was revived from a\nrock called the Dark Stone.\c\nLet's suppose the meteorite\nfrom the story and this stone\r\nare one and the same...\c\nTake into account that elements\nfrom the same era were found in\r\nDragonspiral Tower, where Zekrom was,\r\nand in the Giant Chasm...\c\nIt doesn't prove anything, but it\ncould be a piece of the puzzle.\c\nLet's not write it off as a\ncoincidence just yet...\c
Reshiram was revived from a\nrock called the Light Stone.\c\nLet's suppose the meteorite\nfrom the story and this stone\r\nare one and the same...\c\nTake into account that elements\nfrom the same era were found in\r\nDragonspiral Tower, where Reshiram was,\r\nand in the Giant Chasm...\c\nIt doesn't prove anything, but it\ncould be a piece of the puzzle.\c\nLet's not write it off as a\ncoincidence just yet...\c
Bianca: If your theories are true,\nit should be a really strong Pokémon.\c\nWhat kind of a reason would there be\nfor it to come out only at night?\c\nLike, if, like, it doesn't like sunlight\nor something like that...\c
Until we look into it more deeply, it would\nbe hard to say anything about that.\c\nNow that I think about it, the name\n“Lacunosa" could be derived from\r\nlacunosus clouds, which are clouds\r\nthat resemble a net or a fence.\c\nI wonder if the name is related to\nthe part of the story where they\r\nbuilt walls to protect the town\r\nfrom that Pokémon.\c
Sorry, I rambled on a bit, didn't I?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], could you ask Drayden\nabout this, if you get a chance?\c\nI'm going to do a little fieldwork.\nBianca, help out, OK!\c

[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's up?\c\nHave you seen Team Plasma\nanywhere around here?\r\nI heard a rumor to that effect...\c
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud...\nThis is troublesome indeed,\r\nmy curious Trainers.\c\nPerhaps I should satiate\nyour curiosity somewhat.\c\nThe reason I am still part\nof Team Plasma is this:\c\nI want to know how the world will change.\c\nListen. Pokémon are nature.\nPoké Balls are civilization.\c\nHumans who are used to civilization\ndon't relinquish it easily.\c\nOf course, both nature and\ncivilization are important.\c\nBut what will happen to a world\ntaken over by Team Plasma?\c\nPeople will be forced to throw out\nPoké Balls--a product of civilization.\c\nI want to know what that looks like!\nAnd I want to enjoy it!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Shut your mouth.\c\nAll I want is to get back\na stolen Pokémon!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Give me a hand!\nYou ready?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just to let you know...\c\nYou're about to feel my rage!\c
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Got it!\nGo get ready and then come back here!\c\nBeing careful against opponents\nlike these isn't a bad thing!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you ready to pitch in?\nOK, let's go!
Team Plasma: What's with these two?\nI'm battling alongside Zinzolin!\r\nThis shouldn't be happening!\c
Zinzolin: These Trainers remind me\nof that one from two years ago.\c\nMore important, we must continue\nour search.\c\nLike that scientist said,\nit might be in Opelucid City!\c\nWe'll play with you again later!\c

Do you want to hear that old tale\nof Lacunosa Town again?\c\nIt always takes me a little time\nto tell it.
There's a great big hole behind\nthis town.\c\nA long time ago, a huge meteorite fell\nfrom the sky and made the big hole.\c\nA very scary monster was hiding\ninside the meteorite!\c\nPeople say the monster appeared in the\nvillage at night, with a freezing wind,\r\nand it stole away people and Pokémon...\c\nSo the villagers built big walls to keep\nthe monster out and made a rule that\r\nno one could go out after dark.\c
Whether you believe it or not\nis up to you...\c\nBut even now, the people of this town\nstay inside after dark.\c\nThe old stories and legends\ncontinue to influence our lives.
Oh, fine, fine.\nCome back again when you have time.
Welcome to Lacunosa Town.\c\nIn this town, people live as methodically\nas clockwork from morning to night.\c\nIf you live your life soaking up sunlight,\nyou can sleep very well at night.
Lacunosa Town\nMethodical and Orderly for Safety
The big scary monster that\ncomes out at night is\r\na Pokémon, right?\c\nIt must be a really scary Pokémon\nif everyone believes the legend\r\nand follows these rules...
My granny loves old stories!\c\nI'm always having to listen\nto her really, really long stories.
My grandma's stories were\nreally about Kyurem, it seems.\c\nI guess old stories sometimes\nhave a kernel of truth to them.
There are a lot of people in the world,\nand there are just as many different\r\ncharacteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since\nI took a post here.\c\nSince nobody goes outside at night,\nit's very peaceful.
So the reason nobody goes outside\nat night and it's so peaceful\r\nis because of a Pokémon?\r\nI don't know how to feel about that!
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My Pokémon just runs around on its own.\nMaybe it doesn't need a Trainer?

You must be the ones who want to hear\nthat old tale about Lacunosa Town.\c
Professor Juniper: That's right.\nPlease tell us.\c
Behind Lacunosa Town,\nthere's a mighty big hole.\c\nHave you heard of the Giant Chasm?\c
Bianca: Oh, I've heard that around the\nGiant Chasm, there have been brief\r\ntemperature readings of -58° F!\c\nThat's what Cheren told me, anyway!\c
Professor Juniper: The road is blocked,\nso we can't get there right now...\c
A long, long time ago, the\nGiant Chasm was created when\r\na big meteorite fell from the sky.\c\nA really scary Pokémon was\nhidden inside that meteorite...\c
Professor Juniper: A meteorite...\c
When darkness falls over the land,\nthis Pokémon appears.\r\nA frigid wind follows it.\c\nIt freezes everything around\nand eats people and Pokémon...\c\nThat's why everyone was afraid.\c
Bianca: The Pokémon ate p-people?\c
So our ancestors surrounded the town\nwith walls, to prevent the Pokémon\r\nfrom getting inside the town.\c\nAlso, a rule was made forbidding\nanyone to go outside after dark.\c\n...And that's the end of the old tale!\c
Professor Juniper: A fascinating story!\nI'll add it to my research records.\c
Everyone, we should be going.\c
That's sure a scary-sounding Pokémon,\neven in an old folktale.
Zzz... Zzz...\c\n...Wh-what?\nWhat do you want, now?\c\nDid you pick now to listen to my stories?
Mmm... OK, I'll tell you...\c\nBehind our Lacunosa Town,\nthere's a big hole in the ground.\c\nThat hole, way in the past...\c\nAaaahhh, I'm so tired...\c\nThat hole, there was a...a big...\ncrashed down...inside was...\c\nbig, scary...really scary...\c\nZzz... Zzz... Zzz...
Aaaahhh... Oh, I should...\nOK, I'll sleep, then...\c\nGoodni... Zzz...\nZzz... Zzz...

Undellaaaaa!
The Pokémon World Tournament...\nI wonder if Cynthia will participate, too.
Cynthia is participating in the\nPokémon World Tournament!\r\nI have to cheer for her!
The Riches moved far away,\nand it's a little bit lonelier around here.
The sunlight is strong...\c\nDepending on the Pokémon, that can be\neither an advantage or a disadvantage.\c\nStrong sunlight makes Fire-type moves\nstronger and Water-type moves weaker.
Yaaaay! Yaaay!\nUndella Town!!
Sometimes Jellicent\nfloat into Undella Bay.\r\nThey have a reputation for\r\nbeing a little...unusual.
We're starting construction to\nfurther develop Undella's resorts.\c\nWe just connected to the volcano,\nand we're in awe of nature's power!

Zinzolin: Mmm, it's so warm here.\c\nLet me get to the point.\c\nI have papers that\nLord Ghetsis left behind.\c\nWith these, you can read the ancient\nscripts in the Abyssal Ruins.\c\nAs my own small, little way to atone\nfor my sins, I'll read them to you!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)] is now able to read\nthe Abyssal Ruins script!
Just to make sure you know,\nyou reach the Abyssal Ruins\r\nby using Dive in Undella Bay.\c\nAnd you must write down the\nciphers you find in the\r\nAbyssal Ruins by yourself.
According to Lord Ghetsis's papers,\nthe ancient peoples read in the\r\nopposite direction to how we read now.\c
This is what was written\nin the papers...\c\nIf you reach the second floor,\nread by shifting one letter.\c\nIf you reach the third floor,\nread by shifting two letters.\c\nWhat I mean by “shifting" is replacing\na letter with the previous\r\nletter in the alphabet.\c
The king must be the presence that\nstopped the war and united the people.\c
The king could see the future\nand talk to all living things.\r\nHe united the people.\c\nIf that is the truth,\nhe was just like the hero!\c
There are some characters I can't\nrecognize, but based on the context...\c\nAn extremely wonderful king\nwas laid to rest in those ruins.\c\nIf that king has descendants,\nmaybe those special powers\r\nwere passed down...\c
What?!\nYou made it even further, you say?\c\nAnd what kind of ciphers were there?\c\n...\n...\c\nAhem... Oh, yes, now I see.\c
Keep searching!\c\nYou need to write down the\nAbyssal Ruins ciphers.
Now that I've learned everything\nI wanted to know about the\r\nAbyssal Ruins, I take my leave.\c\nYou are my enemy,\nbut your accomplishments and skill\r\nmake you a worthwhile enemy. Adieu!\c

The Marine Tube.\c\nIt's an undersea tunnel, so to speak.\nDo you know how such tunnels are made?\c\nIt's quite simple!\nThey're built on land\r\nand then sunk into the sea!\c\nWithout Pokémon, the construction\nwould've been impossible.

???: What's this?\c
What's your name?\c\n...\c\nOK. I'll remember that!\n[VAR 0100(0000)], nice to meet you.\c\nI'm Cynthia.\nI'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you.\c\nI have an insatiable curiosity for\nresearching Pokémon myths.\c
I'm sure you know about Undella Bay's\nAbyssal Ruins, right?\c\nI'm staying here at my friend's villa\nso I can investigate them.\c
In order to get to know each other\nbetter as Pokémon Trainers,\r\nI would like our Pokémon to have a match.\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon,\nmy heart always begins to race...\c\nInteresting...\nMy Pokémon in their Poké Balls are\r\nradiating a happy feeling.\c\nAre you the reason?\nWhat are you?\c
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly\nand rationally, am I right?\c\nWhen you're ready, come and talk to me.\nI'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh.\nYou've had a chance to get ready?\c\nI do want our Pokémon to have a match...\nAre you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation!\nWhat an exceptional battle!\c\nI love being here in spring and summer.\c\nI can't stay all year, because there's\nso much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well.\c\nYou're a great Trainer, and it would make\nme happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I come here in spring and summer\nbecause there are a lot of things\r\nto investigate in Sinnoh, as well.\c\nI'd be delighted to see you again.\nYou're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again!\c\nI've got to tell you...\nMy Pokémon are excited to battle yours.\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun!\nNo holds barred!\c
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity.\c\nSummers in Undella Town make me feel like\nI'm on holiday. I forget about battling!\c\nBut in spring, I feel like getting\nworked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are\nexcited about battling your Pokémon...\c\nWould you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For me, it has really been\nworthwhile to come all the way\r\nto far Unova.\c\nWhy? Because...\nI met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the\nfullest, people and Pokémon need\r\nthe chance to throw themselves into\r\nbattle against the fiercest opposition.\c\nThat's why I want to battle you.\nHow about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle,\nI'll learn more about you\r\nand how you've taken care of them.\c
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed.\c\nI know you can battle on bigger\nstages than you've done so far!\c\nIt's so plain to me that your light can\nshine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared?\c\nLet's battle at full strength and see\nhow bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle\nthem to learn about the kind of people\r\nthey are. Observe the Pokémon they\r\nchoose, which moves they taught them,\r\nand which items the Pokémon hold.\c\nYou don't need words at such times...\c\nIf you want to know more about me...\nCome to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: I used to own Battle Castles.\nThen I became one of Unova's Elite Four.\c\nWill I be a Champion somewhere next?\c\nYou never know!
Caitlin: Darach is as neat as always.\c\nHe came all the way to Unova,\ncleaned the villa, and then went home...
Caitlin: Tell me something.\nAre you familiar with Battle Castles?\c\nYou can find them in Johto and Sinnoh,\nso challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa.\c\nI have villas all over the world,\nand I allow Cynthia to use them.\c\nYou are welcome to come and play\nwhenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all\nis better than having psychic powers\r\nyou can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels,\nif I don't have enough input,\r\nmy output suffers.\c\nIt's the same thing for Trainers.\c\nTo grow stronger, Trainers need to have\ncountless battles and learn many things.\c\nThen, they must put what they've learned\nto the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing...\nSilver Wing...\r\nThey stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World...\nand the single Pokémon found there...\r\nWhat an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research\nI do, I still have no clue.\c\nHow old do you think Cynthia is?\nAny idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a\ncertain Pokémon in mind.\c\nDo you get it?\nUsing your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming\nstronger than you are now?\c\nMy answer is simply loving Pokémon\nwith all your heart.\c\nThat's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: The Champions of each region\ngather and compete to see who is\r\nthe strongest!\c\nThat is the Champions Tournament!
Cynthia: I'd love to live here...\c\nBut if I did, there would be a mountain\nof research materials piled up...\c\nAm I right? Cynthia, enough for now!\nNext time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem.\c\nI have a white swimsuit and\na black swimsuit...\r\nWhich one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult.\c\nI was greedy and brought\na lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick\r\nwhich one to wear.
Roxie: I want to be a strong Trainer\nand get even better on the bass.\c\nI'll make both come true,\nso life will be twice as sweet!
Roxie: You can use a pick\nor your fingers to play bass.\c\nPlay the way you like!\nIt's more fun that way!
Roxie: A bass guitar is heavier\nthan a regular guitar!\c\nSo it's more destructive--both in volume\nand as a weapon!
Roxie: Don't ever be satisfied!
Roxie: I...\nAm I living in you?\c\nArgh!\nIt's so hard to think of lyrics!\c\nWhen I start singing, though,\nthey just come naturally.
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but\nPokémon battles are a different story!\c\nIf you're not super prepared,\nyour battles with Electric types\r\nwill leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after\nsafely passing through a rain cloud\r\nin a violent rainstorm...\c\nSomeday, I'd like to share\nthat moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that.\c\nWhen it comes to swimsuits...\c\nYou're either about self-composure\nor you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop,\nskip, and a jump if I use a plane.\c\nBut... I also love to travel the sky\nwith a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm...\nSwimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people\nto draw out a Pokémon's charm\r\nif they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City?\c\nYou know it runs on energy generated\nby Electric-type Pokémon?\c\n...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries\nis bad for your body and spirit.\c\nThat's when you must short out your\nlogic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word...\nWithout even a whisper...\c\nMy Pokémon connect me to other Trainers,\ntransmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly,\nswimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
This villa belongs to Caitlin, one of the\nPokémon League's Elite Four.

A beautiful tune is spreading\nthroughout the town...
Oh, Pansage...\nWhere could you be?\c\nWe went to the amusement park\nand saw a musical.\c\nBut when we were going home,\nPansage got on a different train!\c\nI wonder where it is now...
Oh! Pokémon Trainer!\c\nYou looked for my\nPansage, didn't you?\c\nThank you so much.\nThis isn't much, but please take it.
Oh, my silly Pansage.\nA person with green hair told me that\r\nPansage's dream is to become a\r\nrailroad conductor!\c\nBut... That guy...\nCan he talk with Pokémon?
Ook!
                                                                   
                                                          
Oh, are you also curious about\nthat train?
Unfortunately, no train has\ncome here today.\c
See the train there?
All righty!\nLet me explain!\c
All righty!\nAll aboard!\c
Oh, that's a shame.\c
Hahaha!\nYou're right.\c
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train!\nIt runs faster than a rocket!\r\nIt runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest\ntrain in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train!\nThis is a mass-produced car\r\nfrom a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is\na new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train!\nFew cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train!\nThis is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train!\nIt is the fastest long-distance\r\nhigh-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to\nAnville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran\na long time ago.
This train car is a new train\nto run in the future!
I can see!\nI can see it!\c\nThat lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish\nI could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the\nUnova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train,\nbecause they revised all the parts\r\nto drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train,\nthe number of parts was reduced\r\nso it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design!\nBeauty and utility working together!\c\nThat kind of beautility is unique to\nmass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future\nmass-produced cars that will replace\r\nthe old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration!\nAutomated train-car controls!\r\nIt's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car.\nIts body tilts while going around curves,\r\nso it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy.\nWhen it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it\nhas more parts, so I heard it was\r\ndifficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool!\nThe latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot\ntouch the Hyperspeed Train!\c\nIt really is hyper technology!\c\nAs you can see, we engineers are\nalways seriously dreaming that someday\r\nthe dream will become a reality!\c
Do you know Tubeline Bridge?\c\nThe train that runs on it is\nthis Single Train.\c
Newer trains have to be built\nin a way that's both functional\r\nand environmentally friendly.\c\nCompared to the past, they've\nimproved significantly.\c
The number of parts influences the\nbudget and construction time.\c\nThe streamlined and beautiful design\nof the Double Train is still valued today.\c
It uses the same train car\nas a Super Single Train.\c\nThe only difference is the appearance.\c\nIt is a superb train car that will go down\nin the history of the Battle Subway!\c
The technology born during the creation\nof this train car made the Super Single\r\nTrain and Super Double Train possible!\c
Also, a regeneration brake system,\na car-body tilting system,\r\na whatchamacallit system,\r\na thingamabob system...\c\nI don't remember all the details,\nbut it's just a big festival of all\r\nthe latest technology!\c
Faster! Farther!\nOur engineers' spirits are infused in it!\c
The train car is the same model as a\nSingle Train.\c\nBecause it is an old train car, I hear the\nmaintenance is hard, but it's the one I\r\nalways ride, because I loved it as a kid!\c
The old train cars built with lots of small\nparts have their own unique beauty and\r\nattract a lot of fans.\c\nThose cars no longer run in the\nBattle Subway, but I hear they're still\r\nused in a faraway region.\c\nAh... I'd love to be on that train!\c
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that\nwould be bad!\c\nBut it is full of the latest technologies!\nIt's undergoing a lot of testing.\c\nIt's called a gauge-convertible train.\c\nIt's a sweet car that can adjust its\nwheels to run on any rail!\c
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving\nthe station shortly.\c\nWould you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.\c
This is a quiet town!\nRelax and stay for a while.

Oh! I've been waiting for you!\c\nRecently, we've gotten more passengers,\nso there's more lost-and-found items!\c\nNo one has claimed this, so if you don't\nmind, could you take it off my hands?\c
No worries. No worries.\nJust take it!\c\nIt's better for a Trainer to use it than\nfor me to hold on to it.\c\nI'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found\nitem, come get it, OK?\c\nAlso, if you're interested, take on the\nBattle Subway in Nimbasa City!

By the way...why are you\nholding two Town Maps?\c\n...\c
Oh ho!\nIt's your friend's Town Map, is it?\c

You see, in Floccesy Ranch,\nwild Pokémon might surprise you!\c\nAt times like that, only your\nown Pokémon can help you out!

People always think the past\nor the future would be so wonderful.\c\nBut the great time we're\nspending with Pokémon\r\nis right now!
Want to know what Alder taught me?
He said the Pokémon you throw out at\nthe start of battle is the one\r\nin the upper-left slot in your party!\c\nThat's why I put a Pokémon I want\nto make stronger or a Pokémon that's\r\nalready tough in that spot!
You're being too bashful!\nIt's a good opportunity! Ask away!
Are you happy you're\nable to train Pokémon?
Right?!\nMe too!
Huh? But you're traveling\nwith Pokémon!

Girl: Oh! Are we going to help\ntrain that person, sir?\c
Boy: Really? But that Trainer\nlooks really tough!\c
Alder: That's right! This Trainer may\nbe tough, but you can learn from\r\nlosing as well.\c\nMore importantly, haven't I been telling\nyou just to enjoy Pokémon battles?\c
So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nPlease be their opponent!\c
I'll show you what's\ncool about my Pokémon!\c
That was a fine battle,\nboth of you.\c\nWell, next we have...\c
Ready!\c
Alder: First we have to heal\nyour Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c
Girl: Some Pokémon battles are\ndecided by type matchups!\c
Alder: That was truly\na rousing battle!\c\nI could tell that all of the Pokémon\nwere enjoying themselves as well!\c
How about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nPokémon types are very important\nin battle, aren't they?\c\nWater is strong against Fire...\nFire is strong against Grass...\r\nGrass is strong against Water...\c\nType matchups don't\ndecide everything, though!\c
But, listen!\c\nWhen a Pokémon uses a move\nthat matches its type, the move\r\nbecomes more powerful!\c
Let's heal those hard-working Pokémon!\c\n[VAR 0101(0001)]!\nYou did a great job for [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Meeting Pokémon and people you\nnever would have met otherwise\r\nis truly one of the great things\r\nabout traveling!
Alder: Oh!\nYou won a Gym Badge!\c\nThat's the result of\nunderstanding your Pokémon\r\nand bringing out their power!
Alder: Getting that many\nGym Badges is impressive!\c\nBut you're only partway\nthrough your journey...\c\nWhat does being strong\nreally mean?
Alder: Oh! You've come!\c\nCould I spar with you,\nthe strongest Trainer\r\nin the Unova region?
Alder: Oh! You've come!\c\nI want to show them what's\nincredible about Trainers as well!\c\nCould I spar with you,\nthe strongest Trainer\r\nin the Unova region?
Oh!\nMy heart jumps for joy!\c\nWell, then, prepare yourself\nfor battle!\c\nKiai!\c
Hrm...\nWell, I shall wait here, then.
Alder: That's the Champion for you!\c
???: Gramps!\c\nI did it!\c\nI did it!\c\nI DID it!\c\nThe Black Tower!\c\nI made it to the top!\c
???: Gramps!\c\nI did it!\c\nI did it!\c\nI DID it!\c\nThe White Treehollow!\c\nI made it to the deepest part!\c
Alder: Why, if it isn't Benga!\c\nAre you serious, boy?\c
Benga: Hey!\c\nGramps!\c\nYou know how\nstrong I am!\c\nHey, hey!\c
Who's that?\c
Alder: His name is\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHe's the strongest\nTrainer in the Unova region.\c
Alder: Her name is\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nShe's the strongest\nTrainer in the Unova region.\c
Benga: I knew it!\c\nThat Trainer smells tough!\c
Alder: How about it, Benga?\nDo you want to spar, perhaps?\c
Benga: No!\c\nI know that Trainer's strong!\c\nAnd I want to battle!\c\nBut those Pokémon\nhaven't been through enough!\c
Me!\c\nAnd my Pokémon!\c\nWe climbed to the top of the Black Tower!\c\nYou do that, too!\c\nThere we'll see who's stronger!\c\nLet's try hard to be the best!\c
Me!\c\nAnd my Pokémon!\c\nWe made it to the deepest part\nof the White Treehollow!\c\nYou do that, too!\c\nThere we'll see who's stronger!\c\nLet's try hard to be the best!\c
Later!\c\nGramps and [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Alder: He's a lively one,\neven for MY grandson!\c\nI'll explain what he was\ntalking about.\c\nHe challenged a place called\nthe Black Tower, which\r\nappeared in Black City.\c\nYou'll find out what kind of\nplace it is if you go there.\c\nAn ordinary Trainer, however,\ncan't make it to where he is.\c\nSo that's the story!\nIf you'd like, you should take\r\nthe challenge as well.

Alder: When you find something\nyou want to do, you should\r\ntake it on without a moment of doubt!\c\nDon't worry!\nYou have Pokémon by your side, right?\c\nIf you're together,\nyou can do things you can't do alone,\r\nand your Pokémon can go places\r\nthey couldn't go on their own.
My dream is to strengthen my Pokémon\nhere and become the strongest\r\nTrainer in Unova!

As they wandered in search of Pokémon,\npeople began making homes in more places.\c\nThis ranch used to be a grassy meadow.\c\nIt's now become a place where people\nand Pokémon have homes together!
I don't really know much about\nPokémon types and stuff like that.\c\nI just focus on raising one Pokémon\nand charge ahead!\c\nBut it's kinda the hard way to do things.\c\nWhen I run into a Pokémon that mine is\nnot good against, I can't win anymore!
Oh, you have so many Pokémon!\c\nSeems to me that thinking about how\nto raise each one would be a lot of fun!

Professor Juniper: Well, I suppose\nI should tell you why\r\nI brought you out here.\c
Cheren told me that a group of people\ncalling themselves Team Plasma\r\nare planning to use legendary Pokémon\r\nto take over the Unova region.\c
As you may know, in the Unova region,\nthere are two legendary\r\nDragon-type Pokémon:\r\nZekrom and Reshiram...\c
As you may know, in the Unova region,\nthere are two legendary\r\nDragon-type Pokémon:\r\nReshiram and Zekrom...\c
But two years ago, Zekrom and Reshiram\neach recognized a Trainer as a hero.\r\nThey are following those Trainers.\c\nSo Team Plasma shouldn't be able\nto use the Dragon-type Pokémon...\c
But two years ago, Reshiram and Zekrom\neach recognized a Trainer as a hero.\r\nThey are following those Trainers.\c\nSo Team Plasma shouldn't be able\nto use the Dragon-type Pokémon...\c
Bianca: That's true...\nWhat could they be planning?\c
Professor Juniper: There is much we\ndon't know about Zekrom and Reshiram...\c\nThat's why I want to hear what\nOpelucid City's Gym Leader, Drayden,\r\nhas to say about this.\c\nHe's a Dragon-type Gym Leader,\nso he might know something.\c\nSo, we're finally to the reason\nwhy I brought you here.\c\nI want you to go to Opelucid City\nand hear what Drayden has to say.\c\nAnd, I would also like you\nto help me if something happens!

Thank you!\c\nIt's really best not to get\ninvolved with Team Plasma\r\nto start with.\c\nBut still...\c
Yes.\nThat is the more reasonable response.\c\nIt's best not to get involved\nwith Team Plasma.\c\nBut...\c
Hearing what Drayden has to say\nabout the Dragon-type Pokémon\r\nwill be really interesting.\c\nAnd more importantly, it will help\nfill up the pages of your Pokédex!\c
Bianca: I'll be in the volcano\njust beyond here...\c\nI'm going to investigate the rumors\nI've been hearing about a rare\r\nFire-type Pokémon in Reversal Mountain.\c
Drayden is a Gym Leader,\nso unless you defeat him in a Pokémon\r\nbattle, he probably won't talk to you.
If the season changes,\nthe scenery from the plane changes.\c\nIf the climate changes,\nthe local architecture changes!
Why am I on a journey?\c\nDo you remember exactly\nwhy you're traveling?
I'm fine even right by a volcano\nthanks to my li'l Krokorok!\r\nIt really rocks!

Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Magic Coat!\c\nMagic Coat can reflect any\nopponent's move that lowers stats\r\nor inflicts status conditions during\r\nthe turn the move is used.\c\nBut, there are moves that\nMagic Coat can't reflect,\r\nso be careful!
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Block!\c\nBlock prevents the target\nfrom escaping or switching out.\c\nBut, depending on the opponent's\nmove, held item, or Ability,\r\nit can switch out or escape.\c\nSo, don't let your guard down.
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Gravity!\c\nGravity intensifies gravity\nfor five turns, from the turn the move\r\nis used!\c\nWhen gravity is intensified,\nGround-type moves can hit\r\nFlying-type Pokémon and\r\nPokémon with the Levitate Ability.\c\nOn top of that, the accuracy of\nmost moves will be boosted.\c\nIt also has the effect of making\nFly and Jump Kick unusable.
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Magnet Rise!\c\nMagnet Rise levitates the user\nfor five turns from the turn it's used.\c\nAfter using Magnet Rise,\nthe Pokémon won't be hit by\r\nGround-type moves!\c\nElectric- and Steel-type Pokémon\nare weak against Ground-type moves.\c\nHave them use the move,\nand they can cover their weakness.
Hey, Trainer!\nThe move I recommend for you\r\nis none other than Last Resort!\c\nLast Resort is seemingly a very powerful\nmove, but it will fail if the Pokémon who\r\nlearned the move hasn't used all of its\r\nother moves.\c\nWhen to use it is difficult to tell,\nbut it's a very powerful move!
This quiz is difficult.\c\n“What will happen when you press SELECT\nwhile you are checking the Town Map?"\c\nI don't know, because I don't have one!

I was born here and will die here.\c\nLentimas Town is a country town,\nbut I don't mind, because I don't know\r\nanywhere else.

But, eh, you're havin' trouble,\nso I've got to help out!\r\nThat's what I want to do!\c

That Pokémon...\c\nKyurem, was it?\c\nIts cry sounded\nlonely somehow.\c
Cheren: Kyurem!\c\nTeam Plasma is using Kyurem's\npower for evil?!\c
Then how should we stop\nTeam Plasma?\c\nIf Kyurem is, like Drayden said,\na legendary Dragon-type Pokémon,\r\nthe only ones who could stand up\r\nto it are Reshiram or Zekrom!\c\nBut...\nNeither of them is here right now...\c\nWhere are the ones the legendary\nPokémon recognized as heroes, anyway?\r\nI guess I just have to find one of them!

Silvia: Ommm...\c\nOh! I'm sorry! I was sunbathing, and my\nmind went blank, like I was meditating...\r\nOmmm...\c\nIsn't the weather great?\nWould you like to “om" with me?
Silvia: W-wow! Did you see that?\c\nThat lazybones store owner put\nnew items in the shop!\r\nHe's had the same old stuff\r\non display forever!\c\nHmmm...\c\nIt's fine as long as it doesn't\nrain, I guess.
Silvia: While I was just standing around\nand watching Pokémon play,\r\nI started to feel so happy and peaceful!\c\nI hope tomorrow is a pleasant\nday just like today!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Robbie: My big brother is working\nin the shop, but he thinks putting\r\nnew goods out is too much trouble.\c\nSo go explore a hollow or something,\nand check back later.
Robbie: Amazing! My brother\nfinally put some new items\r\nin the shop he's working at.\c\nHe's the type who can do\nanything if he wants to!
Robbie: My brother is just\nraring to go lately!\c\nHe keeps putting all sorts of\nnew products in the store!\c\nHe said he was inspired by a\nTrainer named [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwho became the best Trainer\r\nin the White Treehollow!
       
       
       
       
       
Ryder: Recently in Unova's Challenge--\nthe White Treehollow--\r\ntalented Trainers are falling\r\none after another.\c\nApparently, a Trainer named\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is on a rampage.\c\nThat's not you, is it? I want to have\na match with that Trainer sometime.
Ryder: You're [VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nYou're the best in the White Treehollow!\c\nThat's incredible. I'm still\nhaving problems with the first area...\c\nGive me some tips later, all right?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Carlos: In White Forest, everyone\nshares the gathered Berries.\c\nI picked some extra ones\nfor the older folks.
Carlos: Living here every day,\neating Berries, makes me miss\r\nthe exciting and exotic food\r\nyou can get in the city sometimes.\c\nMaybe it's time again to go on\na quest for delicious food.\r\nIt's been a while.
Carlos: When I went to the shop\nto prepare for my trip,\r\nI noticed the selection\r\nof items has gotten much better.\c\nBut the guy in the shop was saying\nhe can't lose to [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nWhat could he have been talking about?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Gene: A hollow has suddenly appeared in\nthe white tree! That tree is really\r\nimportant to us here in White Forest!\c\nInvestigators and Trainers\nhave come out of the woodwork,\r\nbut we locals will be the ones\r\nwho make it to the lowest floor!
Gene: Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI heard the news!\nYou made it really deep\r\ninto the hollow, didn't you?\c\nHurry and get to the lowest level\nfor me--I'm about to give up!
Gene: On behalf of everyone in the\nforest, I want to congratulate you\r\non becoming the top Trainer of\r\nthe White Treehollow!\c\nCongratulations!\nThat was a major accomplishment!
       
       
       
       
       
Miho: Waah! I'm so bored!\c\nI just got here, but I can't\nhandle living like this\r\nwhere there's nothing to do!\c\nI miss the neon so much!
Miho: Since I've moved here,\nmy skin has become so smooth!\c\nI wonder if it's because I'm\neating fresh-picked Berries every day.\c\nNature is so amazing!\nHooray for nature!
Miho: Lying on my back in a meadow\nand idly watching the sun sink\r\nbehind the trees...\c\nIt's these simple, ordinary things\nthat are the most fun in this place!\r\nThe people here taught me that!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Rosaline: Oh no! This is no good at all...\nEvery day, I just nap away,\r\nand now I'm really rusty!\c\nOK! OK! I'm going to get back\ninto fighting shape by training\r\nin the White Treehollow!
Rosaline: I'm also taking on the\nWhite Treehollow!\c\nThere are nothing but strange\nTrainers inside!\c\nBut everyone in there\nis really tough!
Rosaline: I went back to basics and\nwas training at the White Treehollow.\c\nIt made me remember the simple\njoys of Pokémon battling, the way\r\nI felt when I'd just started my journey.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], did you find anything\nimportant when you were battling there?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Grace: So you're [VAR 0100(0000)], then?\c\nMy grandson was all excited about\nthis amazing Trainer, so I finally\r\ncame to see for myself!\c\nI thought you'd look scary, but...\nActually, you're quite a cutie!

Ho! Hoo!\nWelcome to White Forest!\c\nIn White Forest, people live\nin harmony with nature and with Pokémon.\c\nPlease listen to the voice of the forest\nand of the White Treehollow.\c\nThey're saying “Bienvenue!"\nHo! Hoo! Hoo!

Ah...ah...achoo!\c\nI can't stop sneezing.\nSpring is here, huh? Blech...\c\nWhat in the...? You there!\nYou were just looking at me, right?!\c\nWhen eyes meet, it's a fight!\c\n...In other words, you just picked\na fight with me, Nimbasa's Feral Liepard!\c\nI hope you've got insurance! Ready?
Harrumph...\nYou've got guts, I'll give you that.\c\nYou're gonna regret this as you go\nlimping back to the Pokémon Center!\c
Lame! You're bolting?\nWhat a pathetic excuse for a guy!
Whaa! How could I have lost!\nAaagh! I could just scream!\c\nAll right then, let's see\nwhat you're really made of.\c\nWe'll ride this old, run-down\nFerris wheel, which puts the “F" in frail.\c\nThe first one to get scared loses!\nOK. Let's ride!\c
...\c\nWhat...\c\nWhat...\nStop lookin' at me...\r\n...Tsk!\r\nOK! OK! All right already.\c\nI'll let you go this time.\nNext time, you're going down!\c\nDon't forget it!
Ah...ah...achoo!\nAchoo! Achoo!\c\nAh, my nose won't stop running!\c\nWhat?! You there!\nYou're looking at me again?\c\nDo you need something?\nYou got a crush on me?\r\nSeriously, just lemme alone!\c\nAagh! I'm so embarrassed!\nDon't bother a sweet, innocent\r\ndamsel like me in a moment of weakness!\c\nI owe you for last time, too.\nYou're gonna pay! You ready? Huh?
Sheesh... You can sure fight.\nNext time, you're going down!\c\nI'm going to crush you!\nCrush, crush, crush you!\c
Huh? What?! You're running?\nI can't believe you'd stoop to that!
Oh, man... Again...\c\nThis is awful!\c\nI seriously can't take any more\nof these tests of courage.\c\nOh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!\nOver there! It's my hoodlum hero!\c\nIt's the living legend of larceny,\nthe one who once took down an entire\r\ngroup of Conkeldurr, the Foongus!\c\nI can't go talk to the Foongus\nafter losing to a brat like you!\c\nAll right! There's no other option!\nI'm a woman! Show me your worst!\c\nYou! It's on!\nGet on that Ferris wheel!\c\nI ain't getting scared this time!\c
Aaarrrgh... That's seriously annoying.\nAt least the Foongus is long gone.\c\nI got away without my\nlameness being seen.\c\nBut, either way, I lost!\nTch.\c\nYou!\nI've had it! I admit I lost!\c\nYou're Nimbasa's Feral Liepard now!\nBut don't you dare tell the Foongus\r\nabout what happened today!\c\nDon't think I've forgiven you, either!\c\nSomeday, I'm gonna make you bawl!\nNever forget that! Seriously!
Yawn. Every day, I'm sure sleepy.\nHey, what are you looking at me for?\c\nCould you be a fan of mine?\c\nI'm sorry, but today's my first\nday off in some time.\c\nCould you leave me alone?\c\nWell, I guess I could have a\nbattle with you. Would that be enough?
Thanks for understanding!\nIt's nice to have such great fans.\c\nLet me introduce my beloved Pokémon!\c
OK. You don't need one!\nSee you then!
Er, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Did I get that right?\c\nYou rocked the house!\c\nSorry about the mistake!\nSo you're not a fan of mine?\c\nMan... Dirk and the Darumakas still\nhave a ways to go then...\c\nWell, whatever. Since we're here,\nlet's go and ride the Ferris wheel!\c
Wh-what?\c\nWhy are you asking if something's wrong?\c\nI'm OK! I'm OK!\nThis just reminded me of a good memory.\c\nAnyway, thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI had a nice time on a rare day off,\nand it's all thanks to you.\c\nIf I get another day off,\nI might stop by again.\c\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Hey! If it isn't [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow are you and your Pokémon doing?\c\nI've got a show after this,\nbut I felt like you might be coming,\r\nso I've been passing time here.\c\nHey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIf you've got a little time,\r\nwant to hang out for a bit?\c\nUm...for starters,\nhow about a Pokémon battle?
Oh, seriously? Thanks!\nYou're awesome!\c\nI'm going to come at you with\neverything I've got!\c\nHit me with your best!\c
Oh...\nDidn't mean to cause trouble.\c\nWell, when you're free,\ngive me a shout sometime.\r\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Aww, man... I get it!\nYou're definitely tough, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAre you aiming to be the Champion, too?\nUh, sorry about that. It was nothing.\r\nJust talking to myself.\c\nAnyway, let's go ride the Ferris wheel!\nThe view is really nice and\r\nmakes you feel really mellow!\c
Was it about two years ago?\c\nRight around here I made a\nfriend at this Ferris wheel.\c\nWe'd battle, but I could never win.\nIt always made me feel like\r\nI had to work harder,\r\nand it really motivated me!\r\nThat's why I made my dance team.\c\nHey, sorry...\nI didn't mean to go on about\r\nsomeone you've never met\r\nwhile we're hanging out.\c\nBut you know what?\nSomething about you makes me\r\nthink about those times...\c\nThe fact that you're really\nstrong is part of it--that's for sure.\c\nAll right! Thanks! Let's hang out again!\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Phew... It's so hot every day lately...\c\nOh, my. What's wrong, dear?\nAre you lost?\r\nI guess you're a little old for that.\c\nWell, what do you need, then?\nWould you like to have a Pokémon battle?
I specialize in taking care of Pokémon\nmore than I do battling with them...\c\nWell, why not?\c\nI'm feeling a little down, and it would be\na nice change of pace.\c
Oh, well.\nOK, then. See you.
Wow...\nYour Pokémon are sure strong.\r\nI can tell you've raised them with care.\c\nTee hee. I work at a preschool taking\ncare of kids and Pokémon, so I can tell\r\nhow a Pokémon is feeling!\c\nWell, recently, I've been so tired that it\nfeels like I'm up to my ears in Pokémon...\r\nBut, that's enough of that.\c\nThere has to be some reason we met.\nLet's spend a little more time together!\r\nC'mon! Come with me!\c
Hee hee... That was so fun!\nYou know...\c\nMy job is taking care of kids and\nPokémon in place of busy Trainers.\c\nSo, for example, if a Pokémon I'm\nwatching gets hurt while playing,\r\nwhen the Trainer comes to pick\r\nit up, the Trainer will go after us without\r\neven listening to what happened...\c\nI know you love your Pokémon,\nbut you're completely different...\c\nWhen I talk to you, I feel like\nPokémon Trainers are pretty great.\c\nIt makes me happy.\nThank you! See you again!
Oh! Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow are you? How have you been?\c\nDo you have some time? There's something\nI want to talk to you about!
Yay! Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nBut...\nJust talking is a little\r\nboring for you, isn't it?\c\nHow about we play a little?\c\nMy Pokémon is in pretty\ngood condition today!\c
Is that so? That's a shame...\nWell, if you have time, let me know!
Boy, that was fun!\c\nI'd love to just play like this\nand quit my job...\c\nYou know what?\nI was watching a Pokémon yesterday,\r\nand I got yelled at by a Trainer.\c\nHey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWhat do you think about Pokémon\ngetting hurt battling one another?\c\nI feel like those are important\nexperiences, but recently I just\r\ndon't know anymore.\c\n...Well, there's time to complain later.\nLet's ride the Ferris wheel!\c
Hmm... Summer isn't the best\nseason to ride this Ferris wheel.\c\nHuh? Are you OK, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nYour face is as red as a Pansear!\nIt's OK if you roll up your sleeves,\r\nyou know. Don't be embarrassed.\c\nHere, I'll roll up my sleeves, too.\nI have to do that a lot at work.\r\nWorking with kids is messy, but I love it!\c\nI almost didn't get the job, though.\nThey were looking for someone with more\r\nexperience. But I knew I could do it!\c\nI begged and pleaded, so they said I\ncould start as a volunteer and learn\r\nthe ropes for a while.\c\nI took them up on it!\nI wanted this job THAT much.\c\nI guess if I don't try harder,\nit will really be a waste.\c\nHee hee. Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI feel much better about my job now.
Aaaaah! It's sooo hot!\nHow are you so full\r\nof energy when it's so hot?\c\nWhat? What's wrong?\nDo you want to ride the Ferris wheel?\c\nOr do you want to battle?\c\nI don't care either way,\nbut I'm not very tough.
Hmmm... I see.\c\nShall we begin then?\nI'm just hanging around anyway.\c
Oh. I see... Well, be seeing you.\nBe careful not to get heatstroke!
See? I'm not very good, right?\c\nRecently, I've been busy with work,\nand I don't have time for Pokémon.\c\nThanks, though.\nI actually had fun.\c\nThat was a nice way to relieve stress.\c\nI don't know if this is a good way\nto say thanks, but I'll treat you\r\nto a Ferris-wheel ride.\c
How is this Ferris wheel?\c\nThere's no air conditioning,\nand it's really worn out, right?\c\nActually, my company is\nrunning this Ferris wheel.\c\nIt's old, and customers don't\ncome anymore.\c\nIt's in a secluded place where people\ncan get into trouble, so\r\nthe authorities say it's bad for safety.\c\nFor our company, it's just a burden,\nand we actually plan to tear it down.\c\nBut for the time being, it will stay,\nso come again if you have time.
Hey there! How have you been doing?\c\nTruth is, I was waiting for you.\nCould you do me a favor\r\nand battle me again?\c\nThen, I'd like to ride the\nFerris wheel again.\c\nThe rule is you have to have\ntwo people to ride, and I don't\r\nhave anyone to ride with me.\c
You don't mind?\nThanks.\c\nI thought you'd turn me down\nbecause you might think a\r\nsudden request like this is creepy...\c\nAs the one who invited you, maybe I\nshouldn't be saying this, but you need\r\nto be a bit more cautious in this world.\c\n...Well, then.\c\nLet's have a Pokémon battle\nto start off with.\c
I see. Well, that's perfectly reasonable.\c\nIf you think about it, it's kinda creepy,\nmaking such a sudden request.\c\nBut, anyway, let me know if you change\nyour mind.
Hmm. I thought I might lose...\nWell, that's OK. I'm not the type\r\nto obsess about winning anyway.\r\nNow I feel more relaxed.\c\nShall we ride the Ferris wheel?\c
Hmmm... On a thing like THIS, huh...\c\nOh... I'm sorry.\nJust thinking out loud.\c\nTruth is, I just happened to be\ntalking to my mom and dad\r\nabout this old Ferris wheel.\c\nThe two of them got all excited,\nand they told me this is where\r\nthey had their first date.\c\nThey said that if it wasn't for\nthis Ferris wheel, I wouldn't exist.\c\nHearing that made me feel\nreally bad...\c\nBut, things have changed since\nmy parents were young.\c\nHurrying and tearing this\nFerris wheel down would be for the best.\c\nBefore we tear it down, though,\nI wanted to look at the scenery and\r\nthink about my mom and dad's youth...\c\nThanks for riding with me.\nOK. Take care!
The wind has become colder...\nI wonder if the doctor will\r\nbe upset with me for being out too long...\c\nHuh? Who are you?\nDo you want to battle, perhaps?
You're a funny one.\nWanting to battle an old lady like me!\c\nHee hee hee...\nBut it's nice of you to invite me.\r\nOK. Let's have a good battle.\c
I see...\nWell, be well.
Aww... That was over in an instant.\nSorry. I'm not very good.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], was it?\nHave you ever ridden this Ferris wheel?\c\nThe view is really really pretty.\nBut, it's a little odd--two people\r\nhave to ride in one car.\c\nUm... Talking about it makes me\nwant to ride it again...\c\nHey, come ride with me!\c
Hee hee... That was a lot of fun...\nI might not look like it, but I'm a mom.\c\nWell, I should say I'll be a mom soon.\c\nRecently, the doctor's been telling\nme to take it easy, and I'm a little\r\nstressed out.\c\nBut today, I managed to relax enough\nfor two.\c\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI hope we can meet again sometime.
Why hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How are you?\nDo you want to battle again?
Hee hee hee... Sure thing.\c\nI have to build up strength\nfor the little bundle of joy inside me.\c\nBut, I'm not supposed to do anything\nstrenuous, so take it easy on me, OK?\c
I see...\nI was expecting a fun battle, but...
Hee hee hee... I just can't keep up!\c\nStill, you have such a cool expression,\nbut when you battle, it's rather wild!\c\nI think guys like that are great.\nYou definitely would've been my\r\ntype when I was younger.\c\nWell now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSince you're here, hang out\r\nwith this old lady a little longer!\c
Hee hee. That was fun...\c\nYou're good at Pokémon,\nand you're really wonderful.\r\nYou remind me of that person.\c\nI hope my child grows up to\nbe a nice kid like you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI have to work very hard to\nmake that happen!\c\nSee you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI had a great time! Thanks!
My sentiment doesn't stop\nat each falling leaf...\c\nHuh? What do you want, girl?\nDo you want something from me?\c\nIt looks like you're a Trainer.\nAre you asking me to battle?
Harrumph.\c\nI have zero interest in girls like you,\nbut I accept your challenge.\r\nShall we get this over with?\c
Really...\nThen leave me alone.
Ah... I can't stand it...\nEvery time I have a Pokémon battle,\r\nmemories of that summer pull at\r\nmy heart and tear it apart.\c\nThat's right... You.\c\nMeeting you here must be fate.\nWill you listen to how I ended\r\nup this way?\c\nI hear telling someone what\nmakes your heart ache\r\neases the pain.\c\nMy painful, painful memories of love...\c\nI don't want anyone else to hear them.\nCome here with me...\c
Sniff... Ex-excuse me.\c\nJust remembering that summer\nmakes it hard to hold back the tears...\c\nTore me up inside, and when that person\ndisappeared...\c\nOf course I was betrayed...\c\nBut still, my heart is still\nnot used to it...\c\nI'm sorry...\nBut I want to be alone for a moment...
Oh... It's you.\nI'm sorry. [VAR 0100(0000)], wasn't it?\c\nHow are you? Doing well?\nHonestly, I'm still the same.\c\nMy shaking heart is still waiting\nfor the rescue squad to save it...\c\nIf you don't mind, could you spare\na moment. Please?
Really? Thank you...\nBut, shall we have a battle first...\c\nI have to be able to have\na decent Pokémon battle by now...\c
Oh... Sorry about the trouble...
It's no good! No good at all!!\nIt's like I can't concentrate at all!!\c\nWhy is this empty, too?\nWhy do I keep remembering?\r\nWhy can't I forget that summer?\r\nWhy?! Why can't I forget\r\nthat sunshine?!\c\nExcuse me for losing control.\nWait just one moment...\c\nI'm picking up the pieces of\nmy broken heart...\c\nSo, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nCan you stay with me a little longer?\c
Sniff... Sob...\c\nYou know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nLove and breakups are sure hard...\c\nBut, do you know what I think...\nEven if something is waiting ahead,\r\nyou should tell the person that you\r\nhave feelings in your heart...\c\nYou don't have to worry about\nbeing hurt. If you give up on\r\ntelling people how you feel because\r\nyou're afraid you can't be together...\c\nAll that's waiting on that flat line\nof fear is eternal loneliness.\c\n...\nThanks for listening to me.\c\nYou're a girl, but our souls are\non the same wavelength.\r\nYou're a true friend...
Who are you?\nDo you want to battle me?
Hmm...\c\nThey must be getting desperate--\nsending a kid like you...\c\nThey really want to take me\nback to the manor, don't they?\c\nWell, if I think of what I'm worth,\nthat's to be expected...\c\nFine!\c\nI'll be your opponent in a\nPokémon battle!\c\nNow listen. In exchange, if you lose,\nyou will get out of my sight immediately!\c
Would you be off, then?!\nI really don't like kids...
Who ARE you?\nI've never seen you at the manor.\c\nIt doesn't seem like you're a member\nof an organization or a hospital...\c\nCould it be?\nDid you just want to battle?\c\nOr did you want to ride the\nFerris wheel and talk?\c\nWell, OK then!\c\nLet's ride the Ferris wheel.\nCome now, hurry!\c
What a relief...\c\nIf you weren't such an honest\nperson, that might have been your end...\c\nThat's right...\nI'm being targeted by his organization.\c\n...\c\nOh, that's fine.\nYou don't need to believe me.\c\nBut just listen to this.\c\nIf I'm safe, the world will\nbe at peace tomorrow as well...\c\nIf not...\c\nYou should hope that\nwe both can meet again.
Why if it isn't [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nOh! That's it!\nStay with me for a moment!\c\nWhy? For a Pokémon battle of course!\nA simple Pokémon battle!\c\nThe people they have chasing\nme are getting tougher recently...\c\nThink of it as helping me out.\nWill you battle with me?
You...\nYou have a lot of promise.\c
Fine then! Go away, then!\c\nIf they see you with me,\nyou'll be in danger, too!
You're just as good as ever.\c\nYou should be able to\ndefend yourself with no trouble.\c\nI'll be OK!\c\nThat fight made me stronger,\nand I always take care of myself...\c\nAlways have...\nAlways will...\c\nCome now, let's ride the Ferris wheel.\nEven they can't strike there.\c
World peace is protected\nby something truly simple...\c\nIt's best if you don't know\nany more than that...\c\nIf you know, that organization\nwill come after you as well...\c\nBut, it's OK.\c\nAs you live out each day,\nI'll try to stay one step ahead of them.\c\nWell let's hope we can see each other\nagain someday.\c\nThen when you become an adult,\ntogether we can...\r\nNo. I'm sorry...\c\nI shouldn't make promises I can't keep.\nNow, go!
Yeah! You over there!\nWearing those cold-lookin' threads\r\nin the middle of winter is pretty\r\nrock 'n' roll!\c\nBut listen, there ain't anyone\nwho rocks harder than me!\c\nLet's have a battle and prove\nwho rocks hardest! Yeeeooow!
OK! Hard-rock grrrl!\nPrepare to be rocked by my beat!\c
You're just gonna rock 'n' roll away?\nThat's not cool, grrrl!
Whoo hoo! Way to rock, grrrl!\c\nNo one can stop your\nhard-rockin' heart!\c\nHey! To thank you for the\nfunky battle, I'll sing you a song!\c\nI can't give it away here!\nMy beats are premium!\c\nThis is a song for you alone!\nHey! Roll on over this way! Yeeoow!\c
How was it, hard-rock grrl?\nMy rockin' music bowl you over?\c\nI dropped a heartbreaking\nbeat in a country style\r\nabout the unending yearning\r\nheart of a sad woman who has lost love.\c\nIt's a tragic masterpiece!\nThat's it for today.\r\nI'll end with an ad!\c\nI'm playing streets all over\nthe world right now!\c\nI'll be here for a while!\nI'm waiting for your encore!
Hey! It's...rocki...\nNo. How are you?\r\nIs that so.\c\nPlease excuse me for interrupting\nyour busy day, but would you be\r\nso kind as to have a battle with me?\c
Thank you very much\nfor accepting my challenge...\c\nGr...\nExcuse me. Please come at me\r\nwith everything you have.\c
Oh. That's unfortunate.\nI'm very sorry to have\r\nstopped you when you were busy...
Thank you so much...\nI knew you rocked...\c\nExcuse me, but I think you're wonderful.\n...\c\n...Truth is, the other day after\nwe parted, I was scouted, and\r\nmy producer offered me a\r\nmassive debut.\c\nBut that's...\nActually, before I continue,\r\nI want to ask you a favor, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nPlease listen to my song again!\c
How was my song?\n...\c\nWell, to continue my story,\nI'm supposed to debut as\r\na sweet and pure pop singer.\c\nThey listened to my songs\nbut said they wouldn't be popular now.\c\nEven more, they said I should\nspeak more politely.\c\nThis isn't me...\c\nBut I may never get a chance like\nthis again. I can't let it pass me by...\c\nSo I'm going to change.\nI'll be cute, pretty, and classy\r\nso everyone will love me...\c\nBut, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nlet me be the real me in front of you!\r\nI'll sing that song just for you...\c\nSo, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nplease come and meet me sometime!
You can only ride this\nFerris wheel with two people.\c\nToo bad. I wanted to tell\nmy sister about it...\c\nHey. Wait a minute!\nRide with me!\c
OK!\nI'm gonna brag about this to my sister!
What? You came here because of the\nFerris wheel, right?!\c
That was a nice change of pace.\nTime to get back to work and train!
It's sure big!\c\nI bet if you ride it,\nyou can see really far away!\c\nThink you can see Nuvema Town?\nHey, c'mon! Ride with me!\c
This sure makes me smile!\nSee you!
Hee hee!\nWe're already here! Let's ride!\c
That was so much fun!\nSee yooou!
[VAR BE09(0001)]This sure takes me back...\c\nYou! Ride this Ferris wheel with me![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]...That made me remember that day.\n...Sorry. I'll be going.[VAR BE09(0000)]
[VAR BE09(0001)]I love Ferris wheels.\c\nSo, you there!\nCome with me![VAR BE09(0000)]\c
[VAR BE09(0001)]Ferris wheels sure are great.\c\nBut that can't be proved with numbers.\nIt's the incompleteness theorem...[VAR BE09(0000)]
Now that you mention it,\nI've been to Nimbasa City many times,\r\nbut I've never ridden the Ferris wheel.\c
Everything is an experience.\c\nThanks for riding with me.\nThat's a big help.
Well... In order to put what's good\nabout Ferris wheels into words,\r\nthe only thing to do is ride one.\c
The scenery changes along with the\nmovement of the Ferris wheel, but\r\nI prefer it when things stay the same.
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou came!\c\nI'm so glad.\c\n...\n...\c\nWhat?\c\nN-no! I haven't been waiting.\nI just got here a minute ago.\c\nAh ha ha!\c\nHey, if you don't mind,\ndo you want to ride the Ferris wheel?\c\nNimbasa City's Ferris wheel\nis really famous for having\r\na beautiful view.\c\n...\n...\c\nReally? You don't mind?\c\nGreat!\c\nI've been wanting to ride\nthis Ferris wheel for a long time!\c\nBut...\nOnly two people can ride it,\r\nso I've held out this whole time!\c\nI'm so happy, I'm all worked up!\c\nLet's hurry up and ride, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
...\c\nAh ha ha!\c\nI'm so thankful for everything\nyou've done for me.\c\nI feel like I can work so hard\nat this job thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI'd like it if we could keep\ntalking from time to time...\c\n...\c\nOK. I'm going to get going...\c\nToday was a lot of fun!\nSee you later, [VAR 0100(0000)]!

In GTS Negotiations, you set the trading\nconditions based on what kinds of\r\nPokémon you'd like to trade.\c\nIf you find a person with matching\nconditions, you may proceed to a\r\nNegotiation Trade with that person.\c\nIn order to trade, you need to have two\nor more Pokémon in your party.\c
Should I describe things in\ngreater detail?
In a Negotiation Trade, each person\noffers three Pokémon to trade.\c\nThen, each person will choose one of the\nother person's three Pokémon.\c
You can set three conditions in a\nNegotiation Trade: the level of Pokémon\r\nto trade, the Pokémon you want to\r\nreceive, and the Pokémon up for offer.\c\nYou may trade with a person whose\nconditions match yours, or choose\r\nTrade Rendezvous to try another trade\r\nwith a previous trading partner.\c
