Where has our WALLY gone?\cWe have to leave for VERDANTURF TOWN\nvery soon…
Hiya! Are you maybe…\nA rookie TRAINER?\cDo you know what POKéMON TRAINERS\ndo when they reach a new town?\cThey first check what kind of GYM\nis in the town.
See? This is PETALBURG CITY's GYM.
This is the GYM's sign. Look for it\nwhenever you're looking for a GYM.
My face is reflected in the water.\cIt's a shining grin full of hope…\cOr it could be a look of somber silence\nstruggling with fear…\cWhat do you see reflected in your face?
Let's say you have six POKéMON.\nIf you catch another one…\cIt is automatically sent to a STORAGE\nBOX over a PC connection.
PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM\nLEADER: NORMAN\r“A man in pursuit of power!”
PETALBURG CITY\n“Where people mingle with nature.”
WALLY'S HOUSE
Excuse me!\cLet me guess, from the way you're\ndressed, are you a POKéMON TRAINER?
… … … … … …\cWell, maybe not.\nYour clothes aren't all that dirty.\cYou're either a rookie TRAINER,\nor maybe you're just an ordinary kid.
I'm roaming the land in search of\ntalented TRAINERS.\cI'm sorry to have taken your time.
I'm the ENERGY GURU! I'll go for it and\nsell you what you need!
Oh?\nYour [STR_VAR_1]…
Went for it stupendously!\cAs its reward, please give it this\nEFFORT RIBBON.
[PLAYER] received the EFFORT RIBBON.
[PLAYER] put the EFFORT RIBBON\non [STR_VAR_1].
You have to go for it a little harder.\cIf you do, I'll give your POKéMON\nsomething nice.
Oh! Your [STR_VAR_1], that EFFORT\nRIBBON looks good on it!
The light of the lighthouse reaches\ndozens of miles away.\cI wonder if it doesn't startle POKéMON\nin the sea.
Ooh, look at this!\cThe seaweed you can get around these\nparts is fresh and full of life.\cWhy, it looks like it can even rear up\nand attack!
Where the water is clean, the fruits\nof bountiful harvest gather.\cAnd where people gather, a market\nsoon starts.\cThat is how a town is born and grows.
Shopping where you can breathe the\nscent of the ocean…\cSLATEPORT is such a wonderful place!
If you put DOLLS or CUSHIONS on\nthe floor, they'll get dirty.\cI'm going to buy some BRICKS so my\nDOLLS and CUSHIONS won't get dirty\rwhen I leave them out.
Wroooar! I'm going to compete in\nthe BATTLE TENT, too!\cBut before that, I need to catch\nsome POKéMON!
Whew… I'm just bushed…\cI hiked over from MAUVILLE CITY.\nBut, boy, this city's huge.\cIf I'd known this, I would've ridden\nmy BIKE here.
STERN, the fellow who built the\nMUSEUM, also happens to be the leader\rof an undersea exploration team.\cSo, everyone calls him CAPT. STERN.
What is that over there?\nThat long line…
When I was a child, I visited\nthe MUSEUM often.\cI used to dream about the mysteries of\nthe sea after seeing the exhibits.
Hey, there! Quit pushing!\nThis is the line, can't you see?
TEAM AQUA has a policy of\nassembling and dispersing at\rthe operation site.
Our BOSS is brilliant.\cWhat would he want to do with\na MUSEUM now?
What's the new scheme, I wonder?\cOur BOSS is scary when he's mad, so\nI'd better not screw things up…
If there's something we need in\nthe MUSEUM, we should take it all!
Hey, you there!\nDon't butt in!
A long line, huh?\cIt reminds me of the times I lined up to\nbuy smash-hit games…
Why are we even lining up and paying?\nWe should just march in!
What?\nWhat do you want?
You want to read this sign?\nI'll read it for you!
Let's see…\cUm… I think it says something like\n“the life in the sea is endless.”\cYup, I'm pretty sure that's what\nit says.
Grumble…\cI should've brought my Game Boy\nAdvance so I wouldn't get bored in line…\cGrumble…
When this operation's over, I'll take\nyou to a hot spring spa!\cThat's what our leader said.\nI can't wait!
The sea is just so vast…\cCould the sea have been made by\nthe tears shed by POKéMON?
Do you know what they do with old\nships that become too creaky to sail?\cThey sink them in the sea so they\nbecome habitats for POKéMON.
Whenever I visit here, I get carried\naway and buy too much.
If you want to change your POKéMON's\nnickname, you'll have to get the NAME\rRATER to help you.
Any POKéMON you get in a trade,\nyou can't change its nickname.\cThe original TRAINER's love for that\nPOKéMON is in the nickname.
Recently, a BATTLE TENT was built\nin SLATEPORT.\cGYMS are fun, but the BATTLE TENT's\nawesome in its own way.\cYou should go find tough POKéMON\nfor the BATTLE TENT!
I was hoping that it was a famous star\nso I could get an autograph.\cBut who's that being interviewed?\nIsn't that CAPT. STERN?
That lady interviewer is so cool\nand pretty.\cWhen I grow up, I'm going to be\nan international journalist!
CAPT. STERN says they discovered\nsomething at the bottom of the sea.\cI wonder what it is?\nWhat could it be?
What's going on here?\cDid the good CAPTAIN come back with\na big fish from the ocean floor?
Hey! Are you watching?\nAm I on TV?
A TV interview! Here!\nThe CAPTAIN's a celebrity!
TY: Okay, CAPT. STERN, a big smile\nfor the camera!
GABBY: I see, I see. You've had a most\ninvaluable experience…
CAPT. STERN: Yes, indeed. We intend to\nmove ahead with our exploration.
GABBY: That's wonderful, CAPT. STERN!\nThank you for taking the time from\ryour busy schedule to talk to us.\cWe hope we can interview you again\nwith news of more discoveries!
CAPT. STERN: Whew…\cThat was my first time to be filmed for\nTV. That was nerve-wracking.
Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou're looking great!\cWe made a huge discovery on our last\nseafloor exploration.\cWe found an underwater cavern on\nROUTE 128.\cWe think it's the habitat of a POKéMON\nthat's said to have been long extinct.
Fufufu…\nCAPT. STERN, I presume.\cWe of TEAM AQUA will assume\ncontrol of your submarine!\cYour objections are meaningless!\nWe expect your total cooperation!\cFufufu…\nJust watch and learn what TEAM\rAQUA has planned!
CAPT. STERN: What was that all about?\cIt sounded like someone using\na megaphone…\cWhere did it come from?
It's from the HARBOR!\cThe submarine!\nThey're trying to take it!
[PLAYER][KUN]!\nPlease, come with me!

If a wild POKéMON gets hurt, it heals\nitself by chewing on BERRIES.\cDid you know that?\cSomebody saw that and got the idea\nof making medicine from BERRIES.\cDid you know that?\cTo turn BERRIES into medicine,\nthey must be crushed into powder.\cDid you know that?\cYou seem to have an interest\nin BERRIES!\cI've got something good for someone\nlike you.
I recently had machines installed at\nPOKéMON CENTERS for crushing BERRIES.\cThe BERRY CRUSH machines are at\nthe DIRECT CORNER upstairs.\cDid you know?\cCould you make BERRY POWDER for\nme using those machines?\cI can make you all sorts of medicine\nif you bring me lots of BERRY POWDER.
Have you brought me some\nBERRY POWDER?
What would you like to exchange\nit with?
Okay, you want to exchange your\nBERRY POWDER for one [STR_VAR_1]?
Oh, dear. You don't have enough\nBERRY POWDER.
This is fine BERRY POWDER.\nIt will make excellent medicine.\cWould you like to trade more of your\nBERRY POWDER for something else?
Okay! When you get some more\nBERRY POWDER, bring it to me, please!
Come back if you'd like to trade your\nBERRY POWDER for some medicine.\cI'm always running a bazaar here.\cDid you know?
SCOTT: Huh?\nI'm sure I met you somewhere before.\cHave I introduced myself to you?\nIf not, my name's SCOTT.\cI just saw TEAM AQUA run away from\nhere like they were stung.\cLet me guess--you drove them away?
SCOTT: Hmm…\nMaybe, just maybe, this TRAINER…
SCOTT: All right! I think you're going\nto become a good friend.\cSo, let's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS.\c… … … … … …
Registered this SCOTT person\nin the POKéNAV.
SCOTT: What I'd like to do is tag along\nwith you, but I do want to keep an eye\ron the talents of other people, too.\cSo, I'll be off to roam other towns\na bit more.\cBe seeing you, [PLAYER][KUN]!
SCOTT: Oh, hey!\nIf it isn't [PLAYER][KUN]!\c[PLAYER][KUN], let me guess--you're going\nto take the BATTLE TENT challenge?\cYeah! That's a good idea!\nThat's a really great idea!\cAfter all, a tough TRAINER is\nthe perfect fit for the BATTLE TENT!\cGive it your best effort!
UNCLE: It's because of POKéMON that\nthis boy's got more pep, I suppose…\rBut he's become a bit too peppy…
WALLY: Aww, UNCLE, please?\cI want to challenge this GYM and see\nhow much better I've become.\cPlease? May I, please?
UNCLE: Now hold on, WALLY.\cSince you started living with POKéMON,\nyou have grown quite a lot stronger.\cBut don't you think you're pushing it\nto suddenly challenge a GYM?
WALLY: I'm not pushing it.\cIf I combine forces with RALTS,\nwe can beat anyone!
WALLY: Oh! Hi, [PLAYER]!\cI've gotten a lot stronger since\nwe met.\c[PLAYER], I want you and my UNCLE to\nunderstand that.\c[PLAYER], please, will you have\na battle with me?
WALLY: Oh… If you won't battle me,\n[PLAYER], my UNCLE won't know that I've\rbecome really strong.
UNCLE: [PLAYER][KUN], was it?\nOn WALLY's behalf, can I ask you to\rbattle with him just this once?\cI don't think he's going to listen to\nany reason the way he is now.
WALLY: [PLAYER], please!\nBattle with me, please.
WALLY: [PLAYER], thank you.\cOkay… Here I come!
WALLY: … … … … … … …\c… … … … … … … …\cI lost…
WALLY: UNCLE…\nI'll go back to VERDANTURF…
[PLAYER], thank you.\nBeing a TRAINER is tough, isn't it?\cIt's not enough just to have POKéMON\nand make them battle. That isn't what\rbeing a real TRAINER is about.
UNCLE: WALLY, there's no need to be so\ndown on yourself.\cWhy, what's keeping you from becoming\nstronger and stronger?\cCome on, let's go home.\nEveryone's waiting for you.
UNCLE: [PLAYER][KUN], it just dawned on me\nthat you must be the TRAINER who kept\ran eye out for WALLY when he caught\rhis POKéMON.\cWhy don't you visit us in VERDANTURF\nsometime?\rI'm sure WALLY would enjoy it.
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\cWALLY: Oh, hello, [PLAYER]!\cI just wanted to tell you that\nmy uncle bought me a POKéNAV!\cNow I can get in touch with you\nanytime, [PLAYER]!\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!
Registered WALLY\nin the POKéNAV.
SCOTT: Hehe…\nI was watching that match!\cYou're friends with that boy WALLY,\naren't you?\cBut you didn't hold anything back\nand beat him impressively.\cYeah! That's what a real POKéMON\nbattle is all about!\cI idolize TRAINERS like that!\c… … … … … …\nI'll be cheering for you!
WATTSON: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou look like you have a lot of zip!\rThat's a good thing, wahahahaha!\cFine! I've decided!\nI need a favor, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cMAUVILLE CITY has an underground\nsector called NEW MAUVILLE.\c[PLAYER][KUN], I'd like you to go there and\nswitch off the GENERATOR.\cThe GENERATOR has been running a bit\nhaywire. It's getting unsafe.\cHere, this is the KEY to get into\nNEW MAUVILLE.
WATTSON: Don't you worry about it.\nIt won't be a challenge to you.\cThe entrance to NEW MAUVILLE is just\na short SURF away from ROUTE 110.\cThat's it, then, you have my trust!\nWahahahaha!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\cI knew it, [PLAYER][KUN]! I knew I'd made\nthe right choice asking you!\cThis is my thanks--a TM containing\nTHUNDERBOLT!\cGo on, you've earned it!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\cIt pleases me to no end to see\nthe young step up and take charge!
You know, it's cool to have POKéMON\nbattles and stuff…\cBut if your POKéMON gets hurt,\nyou have to nurse it back to health.

Hi, do you check out TV at all?\cThey've added a bunch of cool new\nshows recently.\cTV is so cool.

Hi, have you been checking out TVs?
The DEVON CORPORATION…\nWe all just shorten it to DEVON.\cThat company makes all sorts of\nconvenient products.
Hm? A sneaky-looking man?\cCome to think of it, yes, a shady-\nlooking guy went around the corner.
Have you taken the POKéMON GYM\nchallenge?\cWhen you get that shiny GYM BADGE\nin hand, I guess TRAINERS begin to\rrealize what is required of them.
Hey, that's RUSTBORO's GYM BADGE!\cOut of all the POKéMON GYM BADGES,\nRUSTBORO's is the coolest, I'd say.
Oh? Who might you be?\nYou're a new face around these parts.\cHave you just transferred into the\nPOKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL?
I challenged the GYM LEADER, but…\cIt's not going to be easy winning with\nmy FIRE-type POKéMON…\cFIRE-type POKéMON don't match up\nwell against ROCK-type POKéMON…

Wow, you have POKéMON with you, too.\cWhen I get bigger, I'm going to go\nplaces with POKéMON, too.
POKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL!\cIf I go to this school, will I be able\nto catch rare POKéMON easily?
If a POKéMON gains experience in\nbattles, it can sometimes change in\rthe way it looks.
A POKéMON changes shape?\nIf one did that, I would be shocked!
A POKéMON you get in a trade from\nsomeone grows fast.\cBut if you don't have certain GYM\nBADGES, it may not obey you…
Get out!\nOut of the way!
Wait! Pleeeaaase!\cDon't take my GOODS!
Oh, it's you!\cYou're that fantastic TRAINER who\nhelped me in PETALBURG WOODS!\cHelp me! I was robbed by TEAM AQUA!\nI have to get the DEVON GOODS back!\cIf I don't…\nI'm going to be in serious trouble.
That shady character, I think he took\noff towards the tunnel over there.
Oh! How did it go?\nThe DEVON GOODS?\cYou did!\nYou got them back!\cYou really are a great TRAINER!\cI know! As my thanks, I'll give you\nanother GREAT BALL!
You're loaded with items.\nI can't give you this GREAT BALL.

MAY: Oh, what's the matter?\cHaven't you caught or raised your\nPOKéMON very much?\cThat's not very good for a TRAINER!
MAY: So, what do you think?\nHow about a little battle here?
MAY: You just became a TRAINER,\n[PLAYER][KUN]. I'm not going to lose!
Yikes!\nYou're better than I expected!

BRENDAN: What's up?\nWant to have a battle with me?

Did you know this?\cYou can have a 2-on-2 battle even\nif you're not with another TRAINER.\cIf you catch the eyes of two TRAINERS\nwhen you have two or more POKéMON,\rthey'll both challenge you.\cDon't you think it'd be cool if you\ncould beat two TRAINERS by yourself?
No one believes me, but I saw this\ngigantic POKéMON in the sky.\cIt seemed to squirm as it flew toward\nROUTE 131.\cBy the way… Sniff…\nUm… You, uh…smell singed.\cWere you at a volcano or something?
I want to go to the POKéMON GYM,\nbut something's blocking the way.\cAfter all the bother I went through\ntraining on ROUTE 120…

Ahoy, did you know?\cSomeone punted TEAM AQUA out of\nthe way for us!\cThat got the WAILMER out of the cove,\nso we can get our boats out again.

Do you know about the machine\nBERRY BLENDER?
People have to work together to get it\nto spin faster.\cThe faster you can make it spin, the\nbetter [POKEBLOCK]S you can get, I've heard.
It's used for making a kind of candy\ncalled a [POKEBLOCK].\cIf you give a good [POKEBLOCK] to a POKéMON,\nits condition will improve by a lot.
I heard there's a tower somewhere out\non the sea routes.\cIt's called the SKY PILLAR, I hear.
I saw this tall tower somewhere\naround ROUTE 131.\cCould that possibly be…?
We just arrived here on our\nhoneymoon vacation.\cWe happened to see a DRAGON-type\nPOKéMON flying way up in the sky.\cDo cool POKéMON like that live in\nthe HOENN region?
On our honeymoon, we vowed to see as\nmany rare POKéMON as we can.\cSo we were delighted to see a rare\nPOKéMON as soon as we arrived.\cI mean, we are totally happy!
I got this from STEVEN, but I don't\nknow what it's good for.\cI think it's called KING'S ROCK.\nDo you want it?
Why would you want it?\nYou're weird.\cYou can keep it, but keep it a secret\nfrom STEVEN.
STEVEN's house is right over there!
Yeah, you think so, too! What are you\nsupposed to do with some weird rock?
Around MOSSDEEP, you can see wild\nWAILMER.\cIt's called, uh…\nWhat was it now…\cWAI, WAI, WAI…\cWAILMER watching!
The island's SPACE CENTER has been\nlaunching huge rockets.\cThere's been some kind of an uproar\nover a letter they received recently.
The island's SPACE CENTER has been\nlaunching huge rockets.
I heard from a SAILOR buddy that\nTEAM AQUA set up shop in LILYCOVE.\cI also heard that someone came along\nand wiped the floor with them!\cBut MOSSDEEP here's been targeted\nby that TEAM MAGMA.\cIf you want to know what they're up to,\ngo visit the SPACE CENTER.
I'm a SAILOR, so the sea's obviously\nmore important to me.\cBut you know? When I get back on land\nafter a long voyage, I do feel relief!
Wouldn't it be nice?\cIf the whole world was covered in\nplants and flowers like this island?
All life needs the sea to live, even\nthough it makes its home on the land.\cLife, having run its course, becomes\nsoil and returns to the land.\cAnd the sea is always connected to\nthe land.\cYes, like the very shoreline here.
A voyage on a ship is fine.\cBut crossing the sea with POKéMON\nusing SURF…\cNow that's an exhilarating trip!\nWouldn't you agree, youngster?
This rock has a special meaning to\nthe people at the SPACE CENTER.\cThey put it here as their wish for\ntheir rockets to fly safely.\cWhen you make a wish, what do you use?\nDo you wish upon a star?\cI use a wish tag to make it happen.\nThat's what I do.
It's a white rock.

SCOTT: [PLAYER][KUN], feeling good?\nI'm doing great!\cI'd heard MOSSDEEP's GYM LEADER is\npretty strong, so I decided to come\rtake a look-see for myself.\cBut there's something wrong about\nthis town.\cPeople are going on about a warning\nletter and the SPACE CENTER…\cI don't think it concerns me in any\nway, though.
Ahh… It feels great letting the waves\nwash over my feet…\cSpeaking of the waves, you know that\nisland city SOOTOPOLIS?\cI think the GYM there had a new\nLEADER come in.\cPeople tell me the new LEADER once\nmentored WALLACE.
SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM\nLEADER: JUAN\c“The GYM LEADER with the beauty\nof pure water!”

The door is closed.
Diving in the sea. Climbing up and\ndown stairs all the time…\cIf you live in this town, you end up\ngetting physically fit.
These giant POKéMON suddenly appeared\nin the middle of the city!\cAnd, I've never seen them before!\cWhy are they smashing into each\nother like that?\cWhy can't they be friends, those\nPOKéMON?
What? What? What?\nWhat is that green POKéMON?!
GROUDON and KYOGRE…\nWhere did they go?\cWill they cause droughts or downpours\nsomewhere else?
I just get this sense somehow that\nthe two POKéMON aren't angry.\cI think… They probably can't control\ntheir own power…
That flying POKéMON came down from\nthe sky and stopped the rampaging\rPOKéMON…
I… I've never been out of this city.\cI wonder what the world is like on\nthe other side of this round sky?
Wow!\nThis is wicked!
Wow!\nThat was wicked!
Go for it, red POKéMON!\nDon't back off, blue POKéMON!
… … … … … …\cHi, do you know the names of those\nPOKéMON fighting over there?
I was wondering which one would win,\nthe red one or the blue one, but, oh no,\rit's the green one that settles things!\cTalk about a huge turn of events!
There's an ancient legend that claims\nthe land and sea were shaped by\ra colossal battle between POKéMON.\cWell, I'm seeing that happen with\nmy very own eyes!\cWhoa! I never expected to be\nwitness to something this huge!
There's an ancient legend that claims\nthe land and sea were shaped by\ra colossal battle between POKéMON.\cWell, I saw that happen with\nmy very own eyes!\cWhoa! I never expected to be\nwitness to something this huge!
A big POKéMON is fighting with\nanother big POKéMON!\cPlease, someone make them stop!
A pretty POKéMON came down from\nthe sky…
Oh, no!\nSOOTOPOLIS CITY will get wrecked!
SOOTOPOLIS CITY didn't get wrecked!
Hm!\nYou've come all the way to SOOTOPOLIS?\rYou're no ordinary tourist.\cBut I suppose that doesn't make you\nan extraordinary tourist, either.
The city has regained its calm…
Who might you be?\cThis is the CAVE OF ORIGIN.\cThe spirits of POKéMON, becalmed at\nMT. PYRE, are said to be revived here.\cPlease leave.
A person with a strong will and\nsuperior talent…\cA TRAINER who has knowledge and\nexperience of many kinds of POKéMON…\cIf such a person were to appear, I was\ninstructed by WALLACE to lead that\rTRAINER to this CAVE.
Oh, my…\cThe clash between the two awakened\nPOKéMON was quelled by the awakening\rof a third POKéMON…
This is the CAVE OF ORIGIN…\cWith the passing of the crisis,\nthe cave, too, shall sleep…
SOOTOPOLIS sprang up as a town in\nthe crater of a volcano.\cIf you look up at the sky, the lip of\nthe crater is also visible.\rSo, all you see is the sky in a circle.\cBut that's what makes the sky above\nSOOTOPOLIS the most beautiful.
When two POKéMON that gigantic\nare fighting that savagely, there's\rnot much that we can do.
When that third POKéMON flew down,\nI feared the worst.
A circle of a night sky framed by\nthe crater of a volcano…\cAnd in that ring, stars flicker and\nblink as if they were alive…\rIt's my favorite scenery.
The weather was clear this morning,\nbut…\cAll of a sudden, dark clouds brewed up,\nrain started falling in sheets, and\rthere was thunder and lightning, too.\cThe weather just went completely\nwild!\cIs all of this because of those\nPOKéMON?
Oh?\cIt was you who brought that flying\nPOKéMON here?\cWell, aren't you amazing!
MAXIE: G… GROUDON…\nPlease! Stop what you're doing!\cI know the extent of your power now!\cIf you keep going, all HOENN, not just\nSOOTOPOLIS, will be utterly ruined!
MAXIE: So the super-ancient POKéMON\nweren't only GROUDON and KYOGRE…\cAfter all our fruitless scheming and\nfrantic efforts, that one POKéMON's\rsimple action puts everything right\ragain as if nothing had happened…\cFu…\nFuhahaha…
ARCHIE: KYOGRE! What's wrong?!\nLook over here! It's the RED ORB!\rCalm down! KYOGRE!\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cIt's no good!\nIt's not responding at all!
ARCHIE: KYOGRE and GROUDON both\nflew off to who knows where.\cThe weather in HOENN has returned\nto its normal state…\cHaha…\nHahaha…\cMaybe what we were trying to do was\nsomething small, even meaningless,\rto POKéMON…
STEVEN: Those POKéMON fighting…\nGROUDON… And KYOGRE…\cThe two super-ancient POKéMON\nwere awakened from a long sleep…\cAnd now they are smashing each other\nwith their uncontrollable energy…\c…[PLAYER][KUN].\cYou being here now I'll take to mean\nthat you're prepared to become\rinvolved in this crisis.\cWell, then, there's someone that\nI'd like you to meet.\cCome with me, please.
STEVEN: Listen, [PLAYER][KUN].\cDoes seeing GROUDON and KYOGRE make\nyou think POKéMON are to be feared?\cBut that's not true.\nPOKéMON are really more…\c…Why am I asking you this?\nYou already know.
STEVEN: Okay, here we are!\cInside here you'll find someone named\nWALLACE.\cI think you have what's needed to\nhelp him…
STEVEN: I think you have what's\nneeded to help him…
STEVEN: The SKY PILLAR…\cI've never been there.\nI wonder where it could be?
STEVEN: So that's RAYQUAZA…\cIt's incredible how the two rampaging\nPOKéMON would flee from it in fear…
STEVEN: It looks like both MAXIE and\nARCHIE have gone away somewhere.\cPerhaps they've gone to MT. PYRE to\nreturn those ORBS…
WALLACE: Oh?\n[PLAYER][KUN]?\cHaven't you scaled the SKY PILLAR\nyet?\cI'm sure that you can make it to\nthe top of the SKY PILLAR…
WALLACE: [PLAYER][KUN]…\cThe leaders of TEAM MAGMA and AQUA,\nI don't think they meant harm.\cIt wouldn't hurt to hear what they\nhave to say for themselves.
WALLACE: [PLAYER][KUN]…\nMy eyes didn't deceive me.\cThanks to your help, SOOTOPOLIS…\nNo, all of HOENN was saved.\cOn behalf of the people, I thank you.\cThis is a gift from me.\nPlease accept it.
That HIDDEN MACHINE contains\nWATERFALL.\cIf you have the RAIN BADGE, a POKéMON\nthat has learned that HM move can\rforce its way up waterfalls.\cAnd where does one get the RAIN BADGE?\nYou know, don't you?\cThat's right! You have to beat\nthe SOOTOPOLIS GYM LEADER.\cWhen you're all set to go, step through\nthat door.
WALLACE: I'm sure that you will be\ndazzled by my mentor's breathtakingly\relegant battle style.

Oh, is that so?\nThat's too bad, then.
Yo!\nHow's your fishing?
Is that right! That's great!\nHaul in some big ones!
Oh, hey, don't get down on yourself!\nI'll give you a little fishing advice.\cFirst, you want to face the water,\nthen use the ROD.\cFocus your mind…\nIf you get a bite, pull the ROD.\cSometimes you can snag something\nimmediately, but with bigger catches,\ryou need to time the pulls on your ROD\rto haul them in.
I like what's hip, happening, and trendy.\nI'm always checking it out.\cListen, have you heard about this new\n“[STR_VAR_1]”?\cThat's right!\nOf course you know!\cI mean, sheesh,\n“[STR_VAR_1]”…\rIt's the hottest thing in cool!\cWherever you're from,\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\ris the biggest happening thing, right?
Hunh?\nIt's not the hip and happening thing?\cWell, hey, you have to tell me,\nwhat's new and what's “in”?
Hunh?\n“[STR_VAR_2]”?\c… …\c…Uh… Yeah! That's right!\nYeah, I knew that! Knew it all along!\cOf course I know about that!\n“[STR_VAR_2],” right?\cYeah, that's it, it's there!\nIsn't “[STR_VAR_2]”\rthe coolest, or what?\cIt's the hippest thing in hip.\nYou think I'd not know about it?\c“[STR_VAR_1]”…\nIt's, like, so five minutes ago.\cNow, “[STR_VAR_2]” is\nwhat's vital and in tune with the times!
Hmm…\n“[STR_VAR_2],” huh?\cBut personally, I think\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\ris what's real in cool.
Well, if you hear of any happening new\ntrends, come share them with me, okay?
Yeah, absolutely right!\c“[STR_VAR_1]” is the\ndefinition of “in” right now.
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]! Long time no see!\cOh? While I visited the hot springs,\nyou got the LAVARIDGE GYM BADGE.\cYou must have collected\ngood POKéMON…\rNo, I believe you raised some.\cI guess it would be okay for you to\nhave this.
MAY: With those GO-GOGGLES, you'll\nhave no trouble getting through the\rdesert near ROUTE 111.\cBut, wow, [PLAYER][KUN]…\nChallenging GYMS…\cYou're trying hard because you don't\nwant to lose to me, I bet!\c[PLAYER][KUN], I think I should challenge\nyour dad in PETALBURG GYM.\cSee you again!
BRENDAN: [PLAYER], hey, it's been a while.\nHow's it going?\cHmm…\nThat's a decent collection of BADGES.\cAll right, then.\nYou may as well have this.
BRENDAN: Keep those with you if you're\nplanning on going into that desert near\rROUTE 111.\cThere should be some POKéMON that\nare exclusively desert-dwellers.\rYou might look around for those.\cAs for me…\nI'm considering challenging NORMAN,\rthe GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.\cUnlike you, [PLAYER], your dad looks like\nhe really is tough.\cSee you around!
I have here an EGG.\cI'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in\nhot sand by the hot springs.\rBut that doesn't seem to be enough…\cI've heard it would be best if it were\nkept together with POKéMON and\rcarried about.\cYou are a TRAINER, yes?\nAnd your POKéMON radiate vitality.\cSo, what say you?\nWill you take this EGG to hatch?
Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with\nthis here EGG!
[PLAYER] received the EGG.
Oh? You've too many POKéMON.\nThere's no room for this EGG…
As you wish, then…\cIf you have a change of heart about\nhatching this EGG, I will be here.
Every so often, an EGG will be found at\nthe POKéMON DAY CARE.\cOr at least that's how the rumor goes.
We draw as much hot water as we need,\nand yet the hot springs never run dry.\cIsn't it magical?\cThese hot springs appear near active\nvolcanoes. Veins of water under the\rground are heated by magma to well up\ras hot springs.
Being buried in this hot sand is…\nSigh…\cSo warm and heavenly…\cEh? Gyaah! Ouch!\cA POKéMON nipped my backside!
Oh, you like hot springs, do you?\cThat's surprising for one as young\nas you.
I bathe in the hot springs every day.\cI want to become a beautiful and strong\nGYM LEADER like FLANNERY.
If people put POKéMON in hot springs,\nit might be seriously strange.\cWhy, it might be an electric bath, or\na bubble bath, or even a lava bath…
They're claiming that these hot springs\nare good for calming nervous tension,\rrelieving aching muscles, solving\rromantic problems, and attracting\rmoney…

There was a man who dug a tunnel for\na lady he loved.\cI don't really get it, but hey!
The way the winds blow, volcanic ash\nis never blown in this direction.\cThe air is clean and delicious here.\nLiving here should do wonders for even\rfrail and sickly people.
My POKéMON and I, we've been riding\na hot winning streak.\cSo I decided to make my BATTLE TENT\ndebut in this town.
Did you see the cave next to the\nPOKéMON MART?\cThere's a guy in there who's trying to\nbust up boulders so he can bust out\rthrough to the other side.\cIt'd be great if we could go through…\nIt'll make it easy to visit RUSTBORO.
That cave next to the POKéMON MART\nis now a tunnel to the other side.\cIt's great--it's easy to go shop for\nnew DEVON products in RUSTBORO now.

[PLAYER], thank you!\nLet's go back to the GYM!

Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\c…Oh, I see, my dad gave you\na POKéMON as a gift.\cSince we're here, let's have a quick\nbattle!\cI'll give you a taste of what being\na TRAINER is like.
Wow! That's great!\n[PLAYER][KUN], you're pretty good!
MAY: I think I know why my dad has\nan eye out for you now.\cI mean, you just got that POKéMON,\nbut it already likes you.\cYou might be able to befriend any\nkind of POKéMON easily.\cWell, it's time to head back to\nthe LAB.
BRENDAN: Okay, so it's this one and\nthat one that live on ROUTE 103…
Hey, it's [PLAYER]!\c…Oh, yeah, Dad gave you a POKéMON.\cSince we're here, how about a little\nbattle?\cI'll teach you what being a TRAINER's\nabout!
Huh, [PLAYER], you're not too shabby.
BRENDAN: I think I get it.\nI think I know why my dad has his eye\rout for you now.\cLook, your POKéMON already likes you,\neven though you just got it.\c[PLAYER], I get the feeling that you\ncould befriend any POKéMON with ease.\cWe should head back to the LAB.

That seaside cottage is where\nMR. BRINEY lives.\cHe was once a mighty sailor who never\nfeared the sea, however stormy.
The sea, huh?\cI wonder what it's like at the bottom\nof the sea?
If you're going to throw a POKé BALL,\nweaken the wild POKéMON first.\cIt will be easier to catch if it's been\npoisoned, burned, or lulled to sleep.
You're a thief if you try to steal\nsomeone else's POKéMON.\cYou should throw POKé BALLS only at\nwild POKéMON.
Oh, no, I'm not a TRAINER.\cBut that's right, if TRAINERS lock eyes,\nit's a challenge to battle.\cIf you don't want to battle, stay out\nof their sight.
I like filling my mouth with seeds,\nthen spitting them out fast!\cYou can have this, so you try it out!\cUse it on a POKéMON, and it will learn\na move for firing seeds rapidly.

TRAINER TIPS\cIn the HOENN region there are pairs\nof TRAINERS who challenge others\rfor 2-on-2 POKéMON battles called\rDOUBLE BATTLES.\cIn a DOUBLE BATTLE, the TRAINER must\nsend out two POKéMON, the one at the\rleft of the list and the top one.\rWatch how POKéMON are lined up.
MAY: Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cDEVON upgraded your POKéNAV with\nthe MATCH CALL system, huh?\cWe should register each other so we\ncan get in contact anytime.
[PLAYER] registered MAY\nin the POKéNAV.
MAY: Oh, by the way, [PLAYER][KUN],\nhow's your POKéDEX coming along?
Mine's looking pretty decent.\nSo…\rHow about a little battle?
MAY: Oh, what's the matter?\cHaven't you caught or raised your\nPOKéMON very much?\cThat's not very good for a TRAINER!
MAY: So, what do you think?\nHow about a little battle here?
MAY: You just became a TRAINER,\n[PLAYER][KUN]. I'm not going to lose!
Yikes!\nYou're better than I expected!
MAY: I can tell you've gotten pretty\ngood with the way you handle POKéMON.\cBut instead of only making them\nbattle, you should be like MR. BRINEY.\cIt's important to become friends with\nPOKéMON, too.
BRENDAN: Oh, hey, [PLAYER]!\cCool, you had DEVON install the MATCH\nCALL system on your POKéNAV!\cLet's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS so we can keep in touch.

BRENDAN: What's up?\nWant to have a battle with me?
BRENDAN: I know you just became\na TRAINER, but I won't go easy!
Hmm…\nYou're pretty good.
BRENDAN: You've gotten pretty decent\nat handling POKéMON.\cBut, you know, you shouldn't just be\nmaking POKéMON battle.\cLike MR. BRINEY, it's important to\nbecome friends with your POKéMON.

MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], you've been busy\ntraining, too, haven't you?\cI think you deserve a reward!\nThis is from me!
MAY: That's an ITEMFINDER.\cTry it out. If there is an item that's\nnot visible, it emits a sound.\cOkay, [PLAYER][KUN], let's meet again!\cI know it's a little silly coming from\nme, but I think you should train a lot\rharder for the next time.
BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER].\nSo this is where you were.\rHow's it going?\cHave you been raising your POKéMON?\nI'll check for you.
Hmm…\nYou're pretty good.
BRENDAN: [PLAYER], you've trained\nwithout me noticing…\cGood enough!\nHere, take this.

Wouldn't it be great to ride a BIKE\nat full speed on CYCLING ROAD?
How do you like the way my raven-\ncolored hair streams behind me?\cI grew my hair out just for that.
Oh, hey, you got that BIKE from RYDEL!\cOh, it's glaringly obvious.\nIt says right on your bike…\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\cRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL…\nThat name's everywhere.\cYou should ride it around all over\nthe place--it's good advertising!
The two roads, one above, one below…\cA road each for people and POKéMON.\nPerhaps that is right and fair.
I don't have a BIKE, so I'll take\na leisurely walk on the low road.
Learning techniques will make BIKE\nriding even more fun.\cThere are some places that you can\nreach only by using a BIKE technique.
Which should I choose?\cMake a beeline for MAUVILLE on\nCYCLING ROAD, or take the low road\rand look for POKéMON?
Number of collisions:\n… … [STR_VAR_1]!\cTotal time:\n… … [STR_VAR_2]!
Bravo! Splendid showing!\cYour love of cycling comes from deep\nwithin your heart.\rYou've shaken me to my very soul!
Your technique is remarkable.\cI suggest you speed up a bit while\nstill avoiding collisions.
I would consider you a work in\nprogress.\cStill, I hope you don't forget the\nsheer pleasure of cycling.
My word… Your cycling skills border\non terrifying.\cMost certainly, you need much more\npractice riding.
…I am aghast…\cYou're perhaps not cut out for this\nunfortunate cycling business.\cYou ought to give serious thought to\nreturning that BIKE to RYDEL.
This is CYCLING ROAD.\cIf you were to ride from MAUVILLE to\nSLATEPORT on a MACH BIKE, you would\rbe rated for the number of collisions\rand your total time.
Regardless of the results, I count on\nseeing more challenges from you.\rAlways aim higher!
On this CYCLING ROAD, those riding\nMACH BIKES are rated for their number\rof collisions and their total times.\cACRO BIKES do not qualify for rating.\nThey are easy to turn, so it's not fair.

DAD: Hm?\cHey, it's [PLAYER]!\cIt's been a while since I saw you,\nbut you look…stronger, somehow.\cThat's the impression I get.\nBut your old man hasn't given up yet!\cOh, yes, I have something for you.\nThis came to you from someone named\rMR. BRINEY.
DAD: Hm, a TICKET for a ferry?\cIf I recall, there are ferry ports in\nSLATEPORT and LILYCOVE.
I'd better get back to PETALBURG GYM.\cMOM, thanks for looking after the house\nwhile I'm away.
MOM: That DAD of yours…\cHe comes home for the first time in a\nwhile, but all he talks about is POKéMON.\cHe should relax and stay a little longer.
MOM: Is that a breaking news story?
We bring you this emergency\nnews flash!\cIn various HOENN locales, there have\nbeen reports of a BZZT…colored\rPOKéMON in flight.\cThe identity of this POKéMON is\ncurrently unknown.\cWe now return you to the regular\nmovie program.
MOM: [PLAYER], did you catch that?\cWhat color did the announcer say\nthat POKéMON was?
MOM: Well, isn't that something!\nThere are still unknown POKéMON.
The clock is stopped…\cBetter set it and start it!
MOM: [PLAYER], how do you like your\nnew room?\cGood! Everything's put away neatly!\cThey finished moving everything in\ndownstairs, too.\cPOKéMON movers are so convenient!\cOh, you should make sure that\neverything's all there on your desk.
[PLAYER] flipped open the notebook.\cADVENTURE RULE NO. 1\nOpen the MENU with START.\cADVENTURE RULE NO. 2\nRecord your progress with SAVE.\cThe remaining pages are blank…
[PLAYER] took a closer look at the\nHOENN region map.
It's a Nintendo GameCube.\cA Game Boy Advance is connected to\nserve as the Controller.
Oh, hello. And you are?\c… … … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … … …\cOh, you're [PLAYER][KUN], our new next-door\nneighbor! Hi!\cWe have a [STR_VAR_1] about the same\nage as you.\cOur [STR_VAR_1] was excited about making\na new friend.\cOur [STR_VAR_1] is upstairs, I think.
Like child, like father.\cMy husband is as wild about POKéMON\nas our child.\cIf he's not at his LAB, he's likely\nscrabbling about in grassy places.
That [RIVAL]!\cI guess our child is too busy with\nPOKéMON to notice that you came\rto visit, [PLAYER][KUN].
Oh, [RIVAL] went out to ROUTE 103\njust a little while ago.\cLike father, like child.\n[RIVAL] can't stay quietly at home.
I think it's wonderful for people to\ntravel with POKéMON.\cBut you should go home every so often\nto let your mother know you're okay.\cShe might not say it, but I'm sure she\nworries about you, [PLAYER][KUN].
Huh?\nWho… Who are you?\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cOh, you're [PLAYER][KUN].\nSo your move was today.\cUm… I'm MAY.\nGlad to meet you!\cI…\nI have this dream of becoming friends\rwith POKéMON all over the world.\cI… I heard about you, [PLAYER][KUN], from\nmy dad, PROF. BIRCH.\cI was hoping that you would be nice,\n[PLAYER][KUN], and that we could be friends.\cOh, this is silly, isn't it?\nI… I've just met you, [PLAYER][KUN].\cEheheh…\cOh, no! I forgot!\cI was supposed to go help Dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON!\c[PLAYER][KUN], I'll catch you later!
Hey!\nYou…\cWho are you?\cOh, you're [PLAYER], aren't you?\nMoved in next door, right?\cI didn't know that you're a girl.\cDad, PROF. BIRCH, said that our new\nnext-door neighbor is a GYM LEADER's\rkid, so I assumed you'd be a guy.\cMy name's BRENDAN.\nSo, hi, neighbor!\cHuh? Hey, [PLAYER], don't you have\na POKéMON?\cDo you want me to go catch you one?\cAw, darn, I forgot…\cI'm supposed to go help my dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON.\cSome other time, okay?
Hi, neighbor!\cDo you already have your\nown POKéMON?
Huh?\nWho… Who are you?\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cOh, you're [PLAYER][KUN].\nSo your move was today.\cUm… I'm MAY.\nGlad to meet you!\cI…\nI have this dream of becoming friends\rwith POKéMON all over the world.\cI… I heard about you, [PLAYER][KUN], from\nmy dad, PROF. BIRCH.\cI was hoping that you would be nice,\n[PLAYER][KUN], and that we could be friends.\cOh, this is silly, isn't it?\nI… I've just met you, [PLAYER][KUN].\cEheheh…\cOh, no! I forgot!\cI was supposed to go help Dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON!\c[PLAYER][KUN], I'll catch you later!
POKéMON fully restored!\nItems ready, and…
Hey!\nYou…\cWho are you?\cOh, you're [PLAYER], aren't you?\nMoved in next door, right?\cI didn't know that you're a girl.\cDad, PROF. BIRCH, said that our new\nnext-door neighbor is a GYM LEADER's\rkid, so I assumed you'd be a guy.\cMy name's BRENDAN.\nSo, hi, neighbor!\cHuh?

POKéMON fully restored…\nItems all packed, and…
It's [RIVAL]'s POKé BALL!\cBetter leave it right where it is.
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI was just checking my POKéDEX.\cThere's still a lot of POKéMON that\nI've seen but haven't caught.\cAnd there are many others that\nI think will evolve.\cI wonder where I should go catch\nsome POKéMON next?
MAY: I wonder where I should go catch\nsome POKéMON next?\cWouldn't it be funny if we ran into each\nother, [PLAYER][KUN]?
BRENDAN: Hey, it's [PLAYER].\cI was just checking out my POKéDEX.\cThere are still many POKéMON that\nI need to catch, I know, but this\ris looking pretty good.\cChecking this POKéDEX out gives me\nthe urge to hit the road again.
BRENDAN: I'm having a hard time deciding\nwhere I should catch POKéMON next.\cHey, [PLAYER], if I see you while I'm out\ncatching POKéMON, I can pitch you a\rbattle if you'd like.
Hunh? PROF. BIRCH?\cThe PROF's away on fieldwork.\nErgo, he isn't here.\cOh, let me explain what fieldwork is.\cIt is to study things in the natural\nenvironment, like fields and mountains,\rinstead of a laboratory.\cThe PROF isn't one for doing desk work.\nHe's the type of person who would\rrather go outside and experience\rthings than read about them here.
The PROF isn't one for doing desk work.\nHe's the type of person who would\rrather go outside and experience\rthings than read about them here.
PROF. BIRCH is studying the habitats\nand distribution of POKéMON.\cThe PROF enjoys [RIVAL]'s help, too.\nThere's a lot of love there.
PROF. BIRCH: So, [PLAYER][KUN].\cI've heard so much about you from\nyour father.\cI've heard that you don't have your\nown POKéMON yet.\cBut the way you battled earlier,\nyou pulled it off with aplomb!\cI guess you have your father's blood\nin your veins after all!\cOh, yes. As thanks for rescuing me,\nI'd like you to have the POKéMON you\rused earlier.\c[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_1]!
PROF. BIRCH: While you're at it, why not\ngive a nickname to that [STR_VAR_1]?
PROF. BIRCH: If you work at POKéMON\nand gain experience, I think you'll make\ran extremely good TRAINER.\cMy kid, [RIVAL], is also studying\nPOKéMON while helping me out.\c[PLAYER][KUN], don't you think it might be\na good idea to go see [RIVAL]?
PROF. BIRCH: Great!\n[RIVAL] should be happy, too.\cGet [RIVAL] to teach you what it\nmeans to be a TRAINER.
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, don't be that way.\nYou should go meet my kid.
PROF. BIRCH: [RIVAL]?\nGone home, I think.\cOr maybe that kid's scrabbling around\nin tall grass again somewhere…\cIf you or your POKéMON get tired,\nyou should get some rest at home.
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI heard you beat [RIVAL] on\nyour first try. That's excellent!\c[RIVAL]'s been helping with my research\nfor a long time.\c[RIVAL] has an extensive history as\na TRAINER already.\cHere, [PLAYER][KUN], I ordered this for my\nresearch, but I think you should have\rthis POKéDEX.
[PLAYER] received the POKéDEX!
PROF. BIRCH: The POKéDEX is a high-tech\ntool that automatically makes a record\rof any POKéMON you meet or catch.\cMy kid, [RIVAL], goes everywhere\nwith it.\cWhenever my kid catches a rare POKéMON\nand records its data in the POKéDEX,\rwhy, [RIVAL] looks for me while I'm out\rdoing fieldwork, and shows me.
PROF. BIRCH: Countless POKéMON\nawait you!\cArgh, I'm getting the itch to get out\nand do fieldwork again!
MAY: Oh, wow, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou got a POKéDEX, too!\cThat's great! Just like me!\nI've got something for you, too!
MAY: It's fun if you can get a lot of\nPOKéMON!\cI'm going to look all over the place\nbecause I want different POKéMON.\cIf I find any cute POKéMON, I'll catch\nthem with POKé BALLS!
Oh? Your BAG's full.
MAY: I wonder where I should go look\nfor POKéMON next?
BRENDAN: Huh…\nSo you got a POKéDEX, too.\cWell then, here.\nI'll give you these.
BRENDAN: You know it's more fun to\nhave a whole bunch of POKéMON.\cI'm going to explore all over the place\nto find different POKéMON.\cIf I find any cool POKéMON, you bet\nI'll try to get them with POKé BALLS.
Hey, your BAG's full.
BRENDAN: Where should I look for\nPOKéMON next…
It's a serious-looking machine.\nThe PROF must use this for research.
It's a PC used for research.\nBetter not mess around with it.
It's crammed with books on POKéMON.
It's a book that's too hard to read.
PROF. BIRCH: Now…\c[PLAYER][KUN] and [RIVAL], I've had the two\nof you help me study POKéMON.\cThanks to your help, new facts\nare coming to light.\cIt appears that in the HOENN region,\nthere are also POKéMON from other\rregions.\cIt goes to show how rich and varied\nthe natural environments of HOENN\rhappen to be.\cThat's why I think it's necessary for\nme to upgrade your POKéDEX to\rthe NATIONAL Mode.\cHere, let me see your POKéDEX units.
MAY: Eheheh!\cIt's so cool that even my POKéDEX\nis getting updated!\cIt's because you went out and caught\nso many POKéMON, [PLAYER][KUN]!
BRENDAN: I went out all over HOENN\nand checked out POKéMON.\cYou can thank me for getting\nthe NATIONAL Mode POKéDEX.\cYep, you're lucky, [PLAYER]!
PROF. BIRCH: Okay, all done!
[PLAYER]'s POKéDEX was upgraded\nto the NATIONAL Mode!
PROF. BIRCH: But listen.\nYou've become the CHAMPION,\rbut your POKéMON journey isn't over.\cThere is no end to the road\nthat is POKéMON.\cSomewhere, there is a grassy patch\nthat's waiting for you!
MAY: I think I'll take a short break\nfrom fieldwork.\cI think I'll help the PROF here for\na while.
BRENDAN: For the time being,\nI'm taking a break from fieldwork.\cI'll be helping out the PROF here\nfor a while.
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nLet's have a look at your POKéDEX.\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cYes, there's no doubt about it.\cYou really have completed the HOENN\nregion's POKéDEX.\cThat's more than just impressive.\cI have a gift for you.\cConsider it my show of appreciation\nfor the fantastic work you've done.\cMy gift is a rare POKéMON only found\nin another region!\cYou can have any one of these\nthree POKéMON!
PROF. BIRCH: These are rare POKéMON\nonly found in another region!\cYou can have any one of these\nthree POKéMON!
PROF. BIRCH: The FIRE POKéMON\nCYNDAQUIL caught your eye!\cYou're as sharp as ever!\cSo the CYNDAQUIL is your choice?
PROF. BIRCH: The WATER POKéMON\nTOTODILE is your choice!\cYou know how to pick a good one.\cSo, you'll take the TOTODILE?
PROF. BIRCH: The GRASS POKéMON\nCHIKORITA is your choice!\cYou sure know what you're doing.\cSo, you'll take the CHIKORITA?
PROF. BIRCH: Take your time before\nyou decide.\cThey're all invaluable POKéMON.
PROF. BIRCH: I see!\nYou picked a fine POKéMON!
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_1]\nfrom PROF. BIRCH!
Want to give a nickname to\nthe [STR_VAR_1] you received?
PROF. BIRCH: Listen, [PLAYER][KUN].\nYou've completed the HOENN POKéDEX,\rbut your POKéMON journey isn't over.\cThere is no end to the road\nthat is POKéMON.\cSomewhere, there is a grassy patch\nthat's waiting for you!
You received the promised POKéMON.\nBetter leave the others alone.
Oh, you don't have any room for\nthis POKéMON.
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], after this…\nWhat are you going to do?\cAre you going to keep battling\nand sharpening your skills?\cOr are you going to try filling\nthe NATIONAL POKéDEX?\cI'm staying here to help the PROF.
BRENDAN: Rather than collecting\nPOKéMON, I prefer slowly and \rsteadily raising the one I chose.
MAY: Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nHave you gone to that place,\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER?
BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER]!\nHave you gone out to that place,\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER?
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\cSCOTT: Hi, hi, [PLAYER]!\nIt's me, SCOTT.\cI'm aboard the S.S. TIDAL now.\nIt feels great to be on the sea!\cBy the way…\cThere's this place that I'd like to\ninvite you to for a visit.\cIf you're interested, board a ferry\nat either SLATEPORT or LILYCOVE.\cI'll fill you in on the details when\nwe meet. I'll be waiting!\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!
When a POKéMON battle starts, the one\nat the left of the list goes out first.\cSo, when you get more POKéMON in your\nparty, try switching around the order\rof your POKéMON.\cIt could give you an advantage.
When POKéMON battle, they eventually\nlevel up and become stronger.
If the POKéMON with you become\nstronger, you'll be able to go farther\raway from here.
That PC in the corner there is\nfor any POKéMON TRAINER to use.\cNaturally, that means you're welcome\nto use it, too.
POKéMON CENTERS are great!\cYou can use their services as much\nas you like, and it's all for free.\rYou never have to worry!
The POKéMON WIRELESS CLUB on\nthe second floor was built recently.\cBut they say they're still making\nadjustments.
The POKéMON WIRELESS CLUB on\nthe second floor was built recently.\cI traded POKéMON right away.
The clerk says they're all sold out.\nI can't buy any POKé BALLS.
I'm going to buy a bunch of POKé BALLS\nand catch a bunch of POKéMON!
If a POKéMON gets hurt and loses its HP\nand faints, it won't be able to battle.\cTo prevent your POKéMON from fainting,\nrestore its HP with a POTION.
There's a lot to be said for living on\na small island like this in harmony with\rPOKéMON and the family.
I left the major port of SLATEPORT\nCITY when I married my husband here.\cLife goes by slowly on this little\nisland. But being surrounded by the\rbeautiful sea--that's happiness, too.
ZIGZAGOON: Guguuh!
There's a stone cavern at the edge\nof town.\cI've heard you can find rare stones\nthere.
Even if a POKéMON faints and can't\nbattle, it can still use a move learned\rfrom a HIDDEN MACHINE (HM).
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cDEWFORD's GYM LEADER BRAWLY commands\nFIGHTING-type POKéMON.\cGoing against him with NORMAL-type\nPOKéMON is asking for trouble.\cFIGHTING POKéMON will lay a serious\nsmack down on NORMAL POKéMON,\rso be careful!\cWhat's worse, the GYM is as dark as\nthe ocean floor.\cBut it will get brighter after defeating\nthe TRAINERS in your way.\cHey, okay, go for it!
Whoah! It's turned too bright in here!\cYour future is bright, too!
Might is right!\nCome on!
Not enough power…
Your skill overcame my strength!\nYour technique is commendable!
There's no need for BRAWLY to be\ninvolved!\cI'll crush you!
But… How?\nHow could I lose so easily?
I'm not going to waste this loss.\nI'll use it to motivate me to train!\cOne day I'll become a GYM LEADER…\cNo, I'll become the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION!
Don't you dare brush me off!\nIt's not my fault if you cry!
Waaaaaaah!\nI lost!
I battle in the dark to make my heart\nstronger.\cBut because it's so dark, I can never\nsee BRAWLY's face…
Ufufu…\nAre you stumbling around in the dark?
Oh, you…\nI don't want to know you!
You deserve to stay lost and end up\nback at the entrance again!
I'll show you the gumption of\na sailing man!
How'd this happen?\nIt's not like me to lose this way!
Oh, aye! You're worthy of seeing\nour GYM LEADER.
If you mean to pass, it has to be\nthrough me!
Grrrrr!\nVastly overpowered!
You win!\nGo after that BADGE!
I'm BRAWLY!\nDEWFORD's GYM LEADER!\cI've been churned in the rough waves\nof these parts, and I've grown tough\rin the pitch-black cave!\cSo you wanted to challenge me?\nLet me see what you're made of!
Whoah, wow! You made a much bigger\nsplash than I expected!\cYou swamped me!\cOkay, you've got me.\nTake this GYM BADGE!
[PLAYER] received the KNUCKLE BADGE\nfrom BRAWLY.
The KNUCKLE BADGE makes all POKéMON\nup to Level 30, even those you get in\rtrades, obey without question.\cAnd, you'll be able to use the HM move\nFLASH outside of battle.\cIf you'd like, use this TECHNICAL\nMACHINE, too.
That TM08 contains BULK UP.\cIt's a move that raises both ATTACK\nand DEFENSE stats.\c… … … … … …
Registered GYM LEADER BRAWLY\nin the POKéNAV.
I can see your talent becoming a giant\nwave to cause a storm of astonishment\ramong TRAINERS one day!
DEWFORD TOWN POKéMON GYM
DEWFORD TOWN POKéMON GYM\cBRAWLY'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
BRAWLY: A wave may draw back, but it\nalways returns to the shore.\cA giant wave of a talent like you…\nI knew you would return!\cShow me how much higher\nyou've gone!
Wow!\nSwamped again!
BRAWLY: Battling is vast and it's deep.\nYou can't see the bottom.\rIt's just like the sea of HOENN!
BRAWLY: A wave may draw back, but it\nalways returns to the shore.\cA giant wave of a talent like you…\nI knew you would return!\cOh? You only have one POKéMON\nthat can battle.\cI'm sorry, but I'd like you to come back\nwith at least two POKéMON.
What's in vogue? Why, it has to be\n“[STR_VAR_1]”!\cI can't imagine what life would be like\nwithout “[STR_VAR_1]”!
What's in vogue? Why, it has to be\n“[STR_VAR_1]”!\cBut I'm getting kind of bored with it.\cI should look for the next big thing.
I'm teaching my POKéMON about\n“[STR_VAR_1],”\rbut it's not going well.\cIt's a bit too much, I think.
I'm studying up on the hip and trendy\n“[STR_VAR_1]” now.\cIs it true that there's a deep link\nbetween “[STR_VAR_1]”\rand “[STR_VAR_2]”?
Oh!\nSo, my hunch was right!\cI'm one step closer to being hip and\nhappening, yowza!
What?!\nIs that so?!\cIt's not easy for an older fellow like\nme to keep up with trends!
This whole business about\n“[STR_VAR_1]”…\rIsn't there a TV show on it?
Across the sea…\cIs “[STR_VAR_1]”\neven more popular?
I collect official\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rlicensed merchandise.\cI have official\n“[STR_VAR_1]” DOLLS…\cOfficial “[STR_VAR_1]”\nbrand clothing…\cAnd officially licensed\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rpicture books.\cHeheh, I own!\nI'm not sharing anything with you!
IDENTIFYING GOOD\n“[STR_VAR_1]” &\rBAD “[STR_VAR_1]”…\cTHE LINK BETWEEN\n“[STR_VAR_1]” AND\rPOKéMON…\cUSEFUL\n“[STR_VAR_1]”…\cIt's neatly jammed with books about\n“[STR_VAR_1].”
“[STR_VAR_1]'S\nSCREAM” is the title.
“[STR_VAR_1]'S\nSMILE” is the title.
It's titled “THE LAST\n[STR_VAR_1]”.
It's titled “THE BIRTH OF\n[STR_VAR_1]”.
I saw “[STR_VAR_1]”!\nCool, huh?\cIt's, like, the coolest thing going!\cIt was awesome!\nIt was the real thing, oh yeah!
Oh, no, no, no.\cThat alleged\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\ryou claim to have seen--it's not.\cThe authentic article is much…\nHow should I say it?\rSharper, yet more mellow!\cAh, no matter. It's astonishing!
Hey, listen, I composed a theme song\nfor “[STR_VAR_1].”\c“[STR_VAR_1]”\nis really popular right now.\cOkay, listen!\n… …\cOh!\n[STR_VAR_1]!\cWonderful\n[STR_VAR_1]!
… …\cI dare say, chap, it would pay for you\nto work on your singing before you\rtrifle yourself with\r“[STR_VAR_1].”
Anyway, as I was saying earlier, we\nshould get together and organize a\r“[STR_VAR_1]” party\ron the island.
Oh, a smashing good idea!\cIt will settle once and for all\nwho is the best at\r“[STR_VAR_1].”\rBrilliant, indeed!\cStarting today, our lives will revolve\naround “[STR_VAR_1]”!
I was thinking, though…\cWouldn't you agree that\n“[STR_VAR_1]” has\rgrown from being something trendy to\rbeing a part of our daily lives?
Beg pardon?\nThat much, what?\cHowever, it's true that\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rweighs heavily on your mind, whether\ryou're awake or asleep.\cAbsolutely, you're the\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rPROFESSOR, old sport!
If you and me team up as a combo,\nwe'll be invincible when it comes to all\rthings “[STR_VAR_1]”!
Spot on, my friend!\cWe shall be the\n“[STR_VAR_1]” DUO!\cIsn't that a ripe image?\nHahahah!
For me, SLUDGE BOMB is at the peak\nof popularity. It's the one.\cHunh? You're telling me that you don't\nknow about SLUDGE BOMB?\cThat's outright pitiful.\nI'll give you one.
I love SLUDGE BOMB.\cBut POKéMON with the move\n“[STR_VAR_1]”\rare in, too.
Gorge your eyes on this!\cIt's a SILK SCARF. It's right at the\ncutting edge of fashion, yeah!\cOh, I can see your eyes twinkling!\nYou appreciate my dazzling style!\cOh, you're a delight!\nHere you go. I want you to have it!
Oh, you don't have room?\cNow, listen tight, this SCARF is a must-\nhave! Why, I would sell all my items\rin order to get it!
The SILK SCARF raises the power of\nNORMAL-type moves.\cIt's a marvelous SCARF that will go\nwith almost all POKéMON!
Wow, you bothered to cross the sea\nto visit DEWFORD?\cDid you maybe come here because you\nheard about BRAWLY?\cHe's so cool…\nEveryone idolizes him.
Welcome to the HERB SHOP, home of\neffective and inexpensive medicine!
You've come to look at herbal medicine\nin LAVARIDGE?\cThat's rather commendable.\cI like you! Take this!
That CHARCOAL I gave you, it's used\nfor making herbal medicine.\cIt also does wonders when held by\na POKéMON.\cIt intensifies the power of FIRE-type\nmoves.
Herbal medicine works impressively well.\nBut your POKéMON will dislike you for it.\rIt must be horribly bitter!
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cLAVARIDGE's GYM LEADER FLANNERY\nuses FIRE-type POKéMON.\cHer passion for POKéMON burns stronger\nand hotter than a volcano.\cDon't get too close to her--you'll burn!\nHose her down with water and then\rgo for it!
Yow! That was a scorching-hot battle!
Owowowowow!\nYikes, it's hot!
I'm blinded by sweat in my eyes…
Being buried in hot sand promotes\ncirculation.\cIt's effective for healing pain in\nyour joints.
I'm trying to relieve my stress.\nDon't come along and stress me out!
I hope FLANNERY flames you good!
Haaah… Whew…\cIf you spend too much time buried in\nhot sand, it tuckers you out…
You must be getting tired by now.\nYou'd like to rest in the hot sand,\rwouldn't you?\cBut you should know that maintaining\nyour willpower is an important ability\rfor all TRAINERS.
Play with fire, and be burned…
Your skill is real…\nBut our LEADER FLANNERY is strong.\cIf you don't watch yourself, you'll be\nburned seriously.
Can your POKéMON withstand\n392-degree heat?
It didn't burn hotly enough…
The temperature of magma is\n392 degrees.\cYour POKéMON beat me, so they should\neasily survive in magma.
Um…\nOkay, I'll battle with you.
Oh, but you're too strong.
I'm going to be a pretty and strong\nTRAINER just like FLANNERY.
Come on, get with it!\nLet's go before my feelings cool!
It's so hot, and yet my heart is\nclutched by ice…
The way the battling spirit burns\nwithin you, you may stand a chance\ragainst our LEADER.
See how the flames blaze wildly?\nThey flare in anticipation of my win!
Something didn't go right.
Well, so what? I say so what?\nI can walk on hot coals barefoot!\c…Don't even think about trying it!
As much as I love mountains,\nI especially love volcanoes.
Well, it seems to me I lost without\never being in control.
I stay here because I became a fan\nof FLANNERY's power.\cHehehehe.
Welcome… No, wait.\cPuny TRAINER, how good to see you've\nmade it here!\cI have been entrusted with the…\nNo, wait.\cI am FLANNERY, and I'm the GYM\nLEADER here!\cUh…\nDare not underestimate me, though\rI have been LEADER only a short time!\cWith skills inherited from my grand-\nfather, I shall, uh…demonstrate the\rhot moves we have honed on this land!
Oh…\nI guess I was trying too hard…\cI… I've only recently become\na GYM LEADER.\cI tried too hard to be someone\nI'm not.\cI have to do things my natural way. If\nI don't, my POKéMON will be confused.\cThanks for teaching me that.\nFor that, you deserve this.
[PLAYER] received the HEAT BADGE\nfrom FLANNERY.
If you have a HEAT BADGE, all POKéMON\nup to Level 50, even those you get in\rtrades from other people, will obey\ryou completely.\cAnd, it lets POKéMON use the HM move\nSTRENGTH outside of battle.\cThis is a token of my appreciation.\nDon't be shy about taking it!
That TM50 contains OVERHEAT.\cThat move inflicts serious damage on\nthe opponent.\cBut it also sharply cuts the SP. ATK\nof the POKéMON using it. It might not\rbe suitable for longer battles.
Registered GYM LEADER FLANNERY\nin the POKéNAV.
Your power reminds me of someone…\cOh! I know! You battle like NORMAN,\nthe GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.
LAVARIDGE TOWN POKéMON GYM
LAVARIDGE TOWN POKéMON GYM\cFLANNERY'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
FLANNERY: Losing a battle isn't going\nto deflate me.\cI love POKéMON.\nI love to battle.\rAnd… I love this GYM!\cLet's exchange superhot moves\nin another battle!
Whew!\nOn the verge of eruption!
FLANNERY: I lost the match,\nbut I'm completely satisfied.\cIt's not often I get to enjoy a battle\nthis heated.\cLet's have another one like this\nagain sometime!
FLANNERY: Losing a battle isn't going\nto deflate me.\cI love POKéMON.\nI love to battle.\rAnd… I love this GYM!\cLet's exchange superhot moves\nin another battle!\cOh, wait. Do you only have one POKéMON\nthat can battle?\cI hate to say this, but when you come\nsee me, bring at least two POKéMON.
My wife's warming an EGG in the hot\nsprings. This is what she told me.\cShe left two POKéMON with the DAY CARE.\nAnd they discovered that EGG!
ZIGZAGOON: Pshoo!
Use X SPEED to add to a POKéMON's\nSPEED in battle.\cThat will help it get in the first\nstrike--a decided advantage!
On MT. CHIMNEY's peak, there's a local\nspecialty that you can buy only there.\cGive it to a POKéMON--it will be elated.
I think POKéMON get closer to their\nTRAINERS if they spend time together.\cThe longer the better.\nThat's what I think.
It's sort of magical how just sitting\nin a hot-spring pool can invigorate.\cI wish I could let my POKéMON\nsoak, too.
Hohoho! Hey, kid, you can reach\nthe hot springs from here.\cIf POKéMON are getting rest, so too\nshould their TRAINERS.
I'm having a hard time deciding if I\nshould make my SKITTY evolve or not.\cI only have to use this MOON STONE,\nbut it's so hard to decide…\cIf I make it evolve, it will become\nmuch stronger.\cBut it will look so different, too.
SKITTY: Miyao?
This NUGGET I found here…\nI suppose I'll have to sell it, seeing\ras how it has no other use.
Fufufufufu.\cI'm going to make everyone think\nI'm just a kid and let them play down.\cThen, I'll shock them and grab\nthe title!
You know how BATTLE TENTS offer\ndifferent events in different towns?\cMy favorite is definitely the BATTLE\nTENT in FALLARBOR TOWN.\cI think it's fantastic how TRAINERS\ntry to win with all their faith in\rtheir POKéMON.
I heard something about some tent,\nso I came to camp out.\cI didn't know that tents these days\nare so luxurious!\cSince I'm here, I may as well try\nmy hand at battling!
SCOTT: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nSo you came out to this BATTLE TENT!\cThe people in these parts tend to be\neasygoing and laid-back.\cBut, you see, what I'm looking for are\npeople with…\cHow should I say this?\cSomeone bursting with the desire\nand the drive to win.\cIf there were a TRAINER like that,\nI'd immediately…\cWhoops! Never mind!\nKeep working at it!
SCOTT: Instead of wasting your\ntime with the likes of me, why not\rmake a challenge?
We do all right in the preliminary round,\nbut we can never win the appeals…\cMaybe it means I have to watch what\nother contestants are doing…
See!\nMy POKéMON won all these RIBBONS!\cHave your POKéMON earned any RIBBONS?\nYou can check them on your POKéNAV.
I can't beat GYM LEADERS…\cI can't win any CONTESTS…\cI've been here, there, and everywhere,\nand it's all for naught…
POKéMON CONTESTS\nSUPER RANK STAGE!
Oh, hello.\nYou are?\cOkay, your name's [PLAYER][KUN].\nI can see that you're a TRAINER.\cSo that means you use the POKéMON\nStorage System I developed.\cHow I arrived at that conclusion is\na simple deductive process.\cYou spoke to me because you wanted\nto access something on this PC.\cOh, I'm sorry. I'm LANETTE.\cHonestly, I'm glad to meet you--it's\ngreat you're using the Storage System.\cIf you could, please visit me at home.\nMy house is on ROUTE 114.
I wonder what POKéMON looked like\nlong, long ago?\cMaybe the FOSSIL MANIAC at the edge\nof town will know.
In the fields of FALLARBOR, we plant\nseedlings of hardy trees that thrive\reven in volcanic ash.
PROF. COZMO: Oh…\nI never should have let myself be\rconned into telling TEAM MAGMA where\ryou can find METEORITES…\cThat METEORITE from METEOR FALLS…\nIt's never going to be mine now…
Oh!\nHah?\cThat item…\cCould it be?\cIs it the METEORITE that TEAM MAGMA\ntook from METEOR FALLS?\cPlease, may I have it?\cI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO: This TM, it represents\nmy feeling of gratitude.\rPlease use it!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, I can't believe it.\nThis is really, really great!\cThis is really going to help my research!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, but…\nI'm crushed with disappointment…
PROF. COZMO: Please, may I have that\nMETEORITE?\cI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO went off to METEOR FALLS\non ROUTE 114 with some people from\rTEAM MAGMA.
Poor PROF. COZMO…\nHe's so depressed… I feel sorry for him.
Look at PROF. COZMO…\nHe's so happy! I think it's cute.
I'm the MOVE TUTOR.\cI know all the moves that POKéMON\nlearn--every one of them--and I can\rteach POKéMON those moves.\cI can teach a move to a POKéMON\nof yours if you'd like.\cI'll do it for a HEART SCALE.\nI'm collecting those now.
Oh! That's it! That's an honest to\ngoodness HEART SCALE!\cLet me guess, you want me to teach\na move?
Which POKéMON needs tutoring?
Which move should I teach?
Sorry…\cIt doesn't appear as if I have any move\nI can teach that POKéMON.
[PLAYER] handed over one HEART SCALE\nin exchange.
If your POKéMON need to learn a move,\ncome back with a HEART SCALE.
Hunh? There isn't a single move that\nI can teach an EGG.
If it doesn't like a certain move,\na POKéMON will be reluctant to use it.\cIt doesn't matter how strong it is,\neither.\cFor example, a POKéMON with a GENTLE\nnature probably won't enjoy hurting\rits opponents.\cIf it can't seem to live up to its\npotential, it's probably failing at\rusing a disliked move against its will.
My big sister is gentle usually.\nBut when she gets angry,\rshe's really, really scary!\cI bet a gentle POKéMON will be scary\nif it gets angry!
My feelings toward my POKéMON…\nThe attraction runs deep…\cOh, hi, you didn't see that, did you?\nWell, it doesn't matter.\cHow would you like this TM for\nyour POKéMON?
My feelings toward my POKéMON…\nI'm sure the attraction is mutual!\cThey battle exactly the way I want\nthem to!
What kind of moves have you taught\nyour POKéMON?\cI think you would give yourself\nan advantage if they knew how to\rheal or protect themselves.
SCOTT: Hey there, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI thought I might see you here.\cA BATTLE TENT's a place where\nyou can meet tough TRAINERS.\cIt doesn't matter what the rules are,\nor how battles are waged, either.\c[PLAYER][KUN], I expect you to do\nthe best you can!
SCOTT: I visit here regularly in hopes\nof seeing tough TRAINERS in action\rin whatever the situation.
Which CONTEST are you entering?\nWant a piece of advice?\cIn any CONTEST, for example, a CUTE\nCONTEST, I don't think they judge you\ronly on cuteness in the first round.\cYou need to work out ways for raising\nPOKéMON better.
I raised my POKéMON to be cute.\cI found out you can put POKéMON in\na CONTEST for cuteness!\cI'm so glad I raised my POKéMON with\nloving care…
My POKéMON rules!\cIt's cool, tough yet beautiful, cute,\nand smart. It's complete!\cI may as well go for wins in every\nsingle CONTEST.
POKéMON CONTESTS\nNORMAL RANK STAGE!
For any POKéMON match, X SPECIAL\nis crucial.\cIt jacks up the power of some moves\neven though it's only for one battle.
They don't seem to sell any winning\nstrategy guides for the BATTLE TENT…\cIt seems one must rely on one's\nown wits after all…
The NEST BALL works better on\nweakened POKéMON.\cVERDANTURF is the only place you can\nbuy it.
You can't consider yourself a real\nTRAINER if you don't have faith\rin your POKéMON.\cOnly those people who can believe\nin their battling POKéMON can win\rthrough to the very end.
The reason why anyone would visit\nVERDANTURF…\cIt's the BATTLE TENT. It goes without\nsaying.\cOr is there somebody here that you\ncame to see?
WALLY: I lost to you, [PLAYER], but I'm\nnot feeling down anymore.\cBecause I have a new purpose in life.\nTogether with my RALTS, I'm going\rto challenge POKéMON GYMS and become\ra great TRAINER.\cPlease watch me, [PLAYER].\nI'm going to be stronger than you.\cWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.
WALLY: Please watch me, [PLAYER].\nI'm going to get stronger than you.\cWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.
UNCLE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\nWALLY's next door.\cBut, boy, there's something I have to\ntell you.\cThis natural environment is doing\nwonders for WALLY's health.\cMaybe it's not just the environment.\nIt could be POKéMON that are giving\rthe boy hope.
WALLY's gone away…\nHe slipped off on his own…
UNCLE: Is that right?\nWALLY's gone away that far all by\rhimself…\cWell, I have to give him credit--he is\nmy little brother's son.
WANDA: You are?\nOh, right, I get it!\cYou're the [PLAYER] who WALLY was\ntelling me about.\cI'm WALLY's cousin.\nGlad to meet you!\cI think WALLY's become a lot more lively\nand healthy since he came here.
WANDA: Don't worry about WALLY.\nHe'll be just fine.\cI know my little cousin, and he has\nPOKéMON with him, too.
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend\nevery day.\rHappy? You bet I am!
My daughter's boyfriend is a very\ndriven and passionate sort of person.\cHe's been digging a tunnel nonstop\njust so he can see my daughter.\cMy daughter's a little concerned,\nso she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend\nwas digging the tunnel by hand!\cIt's so incredible!
If anything were to happen to WALLY,\nI would never be able to look his\rparents in PETALBURG in the eye…
WALLY was in EVER GRANDE?\cHis parents in PETALBURG would be\nastonished to hear that!
Let me see your POKéMON.\nI'll check to see how much it likes you.\cOh.\nYour POKéMON…
It adores you.\nIt can't possibly love you any more.\rI even feel happy seeing it.
It seems to be very happy.\nIt obviously likes you a whole lot.
It likes you quite a lot.\nIt seems to want to be babied a little.
It's getting used to you.\nIt seems to believe in you.
It's not very used to you yet.\nIt neither loves nor hates you.
It's very wary.\nIt has scary viciousness in its eyes.\rIt doesn't like you much at all.
This is a little hard for me to say…\cYour POKéMON simply detests you.\nDoesn't that make you uncomfortable?
PIKACHU: Pika pika!
Far away, deep in EVER GRANDE CITY,\nis the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cThe TRAINERS who gather there are\nall frighteningly well skilled.
In the POKéMON LEAGUE, I think the\nrules say that you have to battle the\rELITE FOUR all in a row.\cIf you lose to any of them, you have\nto begin your challenge again from the\rfirst one.
What color is your TRAINER CARD?\nMine's copper!
PACIFIDLOG TOWN floats on top of\na colony of CORSOLA.\cIf I told you that, would you believe\nme?
The ancestors of the people in\nPACIFIDLOG were said to have been\rborn on boats and then lived and died \raboard them.\cI understand that they lived that way\nbecause they were searching for\rsomething.
In the HOENN region, there are three\nPOKéMON that represent the power of\rrock, ice, and steel.\cEach of them is said to hide away deep\ninside caves.\cThat's the story I heard when I was\njust a little kid.
“Six dots open three doors.”\cGrandpa used to say that, but I don't\nknow what he meant.
Er-hem!\cI am the POKéMON FAN CLUB's most\nimportant person, the CHAIRMAN's\ryounger brother.\cI'm here enjoying my vacation with\nPOKéMON, yes, indeed.
Ah!\nYour POKéMON…
It clearly likes you very much.\cA POKéMON that adoring and adorable\ndeserves a TM like this, no?
Hmm…\nIt's not bad, but it's also not good.\cYou, as the TRAINER, need to put in\nsome more effort.
It has a vicious look to it.\cA frightening POKéMON like that\ndeserves a TM like this.
If a POKéMON likes you a lot, RETURN's\npower is enhanced.\cIf it doesn't like you, FRUSTRATION's\npower goes up.
Oh, yes. In about [STR_VAR_1] or so days,\nI should be getting a good TM or two.\cYou should come see me then.\nI'll give you a TM that's suitable for\ryour POKéMON.
AZURILL: Rurii.
It appears to be very friendly with the\nTRAINER.
AZURILL: Rururi!
It doesn't appear to like the TRAINER\nvery much.
Check out this [STR_VAR_2]!\cIt's the [STR_VAR_2] that I caught\nyesterday to celebrate my birthday!\cOh, I can see that you want it!\nAfter all, it's priceless!\cI'll tell you what. I might be willing\nto trade it for a [STR_VAR_1].
Oh, so this is a [STR_VAR_1]?\cIt's sort of like a [STR_VAR_2],\nand yet it's subtly different.\cThank you!
No, no, no! I won't accept any\nless than a real [STR_VAR_1]!
Oh, so you're not going to go through\nwith this?\cThat's cool. I'm not desperate to make\na trade or anything.
I know I could go looking for one\non my own, but…\cBut I really wanted to get a BAGON\nthat another TRAINER caught…
Is that a POKéDEX?\cDid you get to meet a lot of different\nPOKéMON?\cI wish I was like you.
People were saying they saw a POKéMON\nflying high above HOENN.\cIs it flying around all the time?\nDoesn't it need to rest somewhere?
A sky POKéMON!\nA sky POKéMON!
Where did you come from?
Yes?\nYES TOWN?\cI've never heard of a place like that.
No? That doesn't make any sense.\nYou have to come from somewhere.\cOh! Wait! You're not going to say you\nwere born at the bottom of the sea?
I can't see MIRAGE ISLAND today…
Oh! Oh my!\nI can see MIRAGE ISLAND today!
MIRAGE ISLAND…\cIt must become visible and invisible\ndepending on the weather conditions\rthat make mirages appear.\cOr is it really appearing and\ndisappearing?
You're…\nAh, you must be [PLAYER][KUN], right?\cThank you for playing with WALLY a\nlittle while ago.\cHe's been frail and sickly ever\nsince he was a baby.\cWe've sent him to stay with my relatives\nin VERDANTURF TOWN for a while.\cThe air is a lot cleaner there\nthan it is here.\cWhat's that? Where's WALLY?\nHe's already left, our WALLY.\cI wonder where he could have\ngotten by now?
I wonder how our WALLY is doing?
[PLAYER][KUN]! Please excuse us for\ndragging you here this way.\cBut our WALLY's become very healthy\nsince he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.\cWe owe it all to you!\cWhen WALLY left town, you helped\nhim catch a POKéMON, right?\cI think that made WALLY really\nhappy.\cActually, not just WALLY.\nIt made me, his father, happy too.\cHappy that he's gained such a great\nfriend as you.\cThis isn't a bribe or anything, but\nI'd really like you to have this.
If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be\nable to go to all sorts of places.
WALLY's coming home soon.\nI'm looking forward to that.
Oh? You met WALLY in\nEVER GRANDE CITY?\cOh, [PLAYER][KUN], don't be silly.\cHe may have gotten healthy, but he\ncan't go somewhere far away like\rthat all by himself.
WALLY was really happy when he told\nus that he caught a POKéMON.\cIt's been ages since I've seen him\nsmile like that.
I want you to keep this a secret\nfrom my husband…\cBut our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN\nwithout telling anyone.\cYou know, WALLY is frail, but\nhe's surprisingly strong-willed.\cI'm sure that he'll come back safe\nand sound one day!
DAD: Hm?\cWell, if it isn't [PLAYER]!\nSo you're all finished moving in?\cI'm surprised that you managed to\nget here by yourself.\cOh, I see.\nYou're with your POKéMON.\cHm… Then I guess you're going to\nbecome a TRAINER like me, [PLAYER].\cThat's great news!\nI'll be looking forward to it!
Um… I…\nI'd like to get a POKéMON, please…
DAD: Hm? You're… Uh… Oh, right.\nYou're WALLY, right?
WALLY: I'm going to go stay with my\nrelatives in VERDANTURF TOWN.\cI thought I would be lonely by myself,\nso I wanted to take a POKéMON along.\cBut I've never caught a POKéMON before.\nI don't know how…
DAD: Hm. I see.
DAD: [PLAYER], you heard that,\nright?\cGo with WALLY and make sure that he\nsafely catches a POKéMON.
WALLY, here, I'll loan you my POKéMON.\cWALLY received a ZIGZAGOON!
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nA POKéMON!\cDAD: Hm. I'll give you a POKé BALL, too.\nGo for it!\cWALLY received a POKé BALL!
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nThank you!
[PLAYER]… Would you really come\nwith me?
DAD: So, did it work out?
WALLY: Thank you, yes, it did.\nHere's your POKéMON back.\c[PLAYER], thank you for coming along\nwith me.\cYou two are why I was able to catch\nmy POKéMON.\cI promise I'll take really good\ncare of it.\cOh! My mom's waiting for me,\nso I have to go!\cBye, [PLAYER]!
DAD: Now…\c[PLAYER], if you want to become a\nstrong TRAINER, here's my advice.\cHead for RUSTBORO CITY beyond this\ntown.\cThere, you should challenge\nthe GYM LEADER, ROXANNE.\cAfter her, go on to other POKéMON\nGYMS and defeat their LEADERS.\cCollect BADGES from them,\nunderstood?\cOf course, I'm a GYM LEADER, too.\nWe'll battle one day, [PLAYER].\cBut that's only after you become\nstronger.
DAD: Hm? Aren't you going to the\nPOKéMON GYM in RUSTBORO CITY?\cThere's no challenge for me to\nbattle a greenhorn TRAINER.\c[PLAYER], I want you to challenge me\nwhen you become a lot stronger.\cI'll battle you, [PLAYER], when you\ncan show me four GYM BADGES, okay?
DAD: I see… So, you've beaten\nthe GYM LEADER in RUSTBORO CITY.\cBut there are many more TRAINERS\nwho are stronger than you, [PLAYER].\cAcross the sea in DEWFORD TOWN is a\nGYM LEADER named BRAWLY.\cYou should go challenge him.
DAD: Hm… [PLAYER], you have gotten\nstronger.\cI can tell by the number of BADGES\nthat you've earned.
DAD: Hm…\nSo, you did get four GYM BADGES.\cFine, as I promised, we will have\na POKéMON battle.\c[PLAYER]…\cI'm so happy that I can have\na real battle with my own child.\cBut, a battle is a battle!\cI will do everything in my power as\na GYM LEADER to win.\c[PLAYER], you'd better give it your\nbest shot, too!
…\cI… I can't…\cI can't believe it. [PLAYER]…\cI lost to [PLAYER]?\cBut, rules are rules!\nHere, take this.
[PLAYER] received the BALANCE BADGE\nfrom DAD!
DAD: With that BADGE, the DEFENSE\nof all your POKéMON will increase.\cPOKéMON that know the HM move SURF\nwill be able to travel over water.\cThis is my gift to you. [PLAYER], I'm\nsure you can use it correctly.
DAD: TM42 contains FACADE.\cIt doubles the power of moves if\nthe POKéMON is poisoned, paralyzed,\ror burned.\cIt might be able to turn a bad\nsituation into an advantage.
DAD: As the GYM LEADER, I can't\nexpress how upset I am…\cBut as a father, it makes me both\nhappy and a little sad. It's odd…
Ah, there you are, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cPlease come with me.\nI have something I want you to have.
NORMAN, you don't mind, do you?\cLet me borrow your [PLAYER][KUN] for\na minute or two.
DAD: [PLAYER], you should go visit\nyour mother every so often.\cI'm going to stay here and redouble\nmy training.\cIt would bother me as a TRAINER to\nnot avenge my loss to you, [PLAYER]!
DAD: [PLAYER], how are things going?\cThe world of POKéMON is deep.\cI honestly think that no amount of\ntraining would ever be enough.
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cThe doors in this GYM open when you\nbeat the awaiting TRAINERS.\cWhoops! The doors in this room are\nalready open, so don't attack me!\cThe TRAINERS of PETALBURG GYM\nuse all kinds of items.\cThe door at the left leads to\nthe SPEED ROOM.\cThe door at the right leads to\nthe ACCURACY ROOM.\cThe room's name will be on\nthe door, so choose carefully.\cOnce you've chosen the door…\nWell, hey, go for it!
[PLAYER]! Whoa! You've overcome even\nyour own father!\cLike, whoa!\nWhat a stunning turn of events!
The ability to attack before the\nopponent…\cJust that alone puts me at a great\nadvantage, don't you agree?
That was a magnificent battle!
Go on to the next room where a new\nchallenge awaits you.\cAt the left is the CONFUSION ROOM.\cThe right door leads to the DEFENSE\nROOM.
Whomever you beat, and whomever you\nmay lose to, you never shirk from\rtraining yourself and your POKéMON.\cThat's what I think being a\nGYM LEADER is all about.
This is the CONFUSION ROOM.\cLet me see how well bonded you are\nwith your POKéMON!
I couldn't confuse your team enough…\nYou share a strong bond together.
The next room is the STRENGTH ROOM.\nCan you withstand brute force?
After you beat our LEADER, the\ntraining has become a lot tougher.
Just when you think you're going to\nwin, your opponent restores HP…\cCan you just imagine how awful that\nmust feel?\cI'll show you exactly how awful it\nfeels!
I couldn't restore HP enough…\nWhat ATTACK power…
I should have expected no less from\nour LEADER's kid.\cNo, wait! A TRAINER's abilities are\nearned only through effort.\cI lost because my own efforts\nweren't enough.\cGo on! The ONE-HIT KO ROOM is next.
I'm going to keep training at GYMS.\nOne day, I'll become a LEADER.
I'm not going to take it easy just\nbecause you're our LEADER's kid.\cI'll show you how horrid it is for\na POKéMON to take a critical hit!
Your power…\nYou're the real deal.
Your father really is strong.\nHe's a TRAINER worth my respect.\cAnd, I sense the same glow coming\nfrom you as your father.\cI hope that you'll stage a terrific\nbattle with your father!
Since your dad became the LEADER,\nthe TRAINERS of PETALBURG CITY have\rbecome a lot tougher.
Giggle…\nThis is the ACCURACY ROOM.\cIt's pretty nasty when every attack\nlands without fail.
You were a cut above me…
There are some even stronger\nTRAINERS waiting for you.\cThe left is the DEFENSE ROOM, and\nthe right is the RECOVERY ROOM.\cYour POKéMON's ATTACK power will be\non trial either way.
Do you know what we're trying to\nachieve as TRAINERS?\cWe're striving to become soul mates\nwith our POKéMON.
The higher the DEFENSE, the more\nreckless I can be in attack.
Our defenses weren't enough…
I think you've taught me a valuable\nlesson here.\cNow, go on! The left door goes to\nthe STRENGTH ROOM.\cThe right door opens to\nthe ONE-HIT KO ROOM.\cBoth of them have TRAINERS who are\nskilled at offense.
Hi! Have you tried using SURF?
Our GYM LEADER told us to go all out\nand beat you.\cEven if you happen to be the\nLEADER's kid!
But… I went all out!
The way you use your POKéMON…\nIt's like your father's style.\cGo on through! The GYM LEADER, your\nfather, is waiting!
Sure, it's fine to make your POKéMON\nstronger.\cBut what decides the winner?\cWhy, it's the feelings TRAINERS have\nfor their POKéMON.
This door appears to be locked\nright now…
“SPEED ROOM,” the sign says.\cDo you want to go through?

PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM
PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM\cNORMAN'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
DAD: [PLAYER]…\nI had a feeling that you would come.\cI would never refuse to accept\na challenge from you.\cYou do understand, don't you?\cInside a GYM, it doesn't matter that\nwe are a parent and child.\c…No, because we are parent and child,\nwe owe it to each other to do the best\rwe can. Isn't that right, [PLAYER]?
Uh… Haha…\nMaybe that was going too hard…
DAD: [PLAYER]…\nWhat is your dream?\cMy dream…\nHahaha…\rIt has already come true, actually.
DAD: [PLAYER]…\nI had a feeling that you would come.\cI would never refuse to accept\na challenge from you.\cYou do understand, don't you?\cInside a GYM, it doesn't matter that\nwe are a parent and child.\cHm? Wait a second, [PLAYER].\cDo you only have one POKéMON that is\ncapable of battle?\cSorry, but you'll have to come back\nwith at least two POKéMON.
Traveling is wonderful!\cWhen I was young, I roamed the seas\nand the mountains!
Sigh…\cI wish I could go on an adventure\nwith some POKéMON…\cCrawl through some damp grass…\nClimb rocky, rugged mountains…\cCross the raging seas…\nWander about in dark caves…\cAnd, sometimes, even get a little\nhomesick…\cIt must be fabulous to travel!
NORMAN became our town's new\nGYM LEADER.\cI think he called his family over from\nsomewhere far away.
I battled NORMAN once, but, whew,\nhe was way too strong.\cHow would I put it?\cI just got the feeling that he\nlives for POKéMON.
That PC-based POKéMON Storage\nSystem…\cWhoever made it must be some kind\nof a scientific wizard!
When my POKéMON ate an\nORAN BERRY, it regained HP!
There are many types of POKéMON.\cAll types have their strengths and\nweaknesses against other types.\cDepending on the types of POKéMON,\na battle could be easy or hard.
For example, your TREECKO\nis a GRASS type.\cIt's strong against the WATER and\nGROUND types.\cBut, it's weak against FIRE-type\nPOKéMON.
For example, your TORCHIC\nis a FIRE type.\cIt's strong against the GRASS and\nBUG types.\cBut, it's weak against WATER-type\nPOKéMON.
For example, your MUDKIP\nis a WATER type.\cIt's strong against the FIRE type.\cBut, it's weak against GRASS-type\nand ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.
Even if a POKéMON is weak now,\nit will grow stronger.\cThe most important thing is love!\nLove for your POKéMON!
Do you use REPEL?\nIt keeps POKéMON away, so it's\ruseful when you're in a hurry.
Do you have any ANTIDOTES with\nyou?\cIf you walk around with a poisoned\nPOKéMON, it will lose HP until it faints.\rTake some ANTIDOTES with you.
Umm… If this goes here, and that\ngoes over there…\cThen where does this thing go?\nAnd what about that doohickey?\cAaargh! I can't make heads or tails\nof this!
Hm?\nHi, I'm DOCK.\cCAPT. STERN commissioned me to\ndesign a ferry.\cOh! That there…\nAre they DEVON GOODS?\cBut, hmm…\nThis won't do…\cCAPT. STERN went off somewhere.\nHe said he had some work to do.\cCould I get you to go find CAPT.\nSTERN and deliver that to him?
DOCK: Where could CAPT. STERN have\ngone off to?\cCould you go find CAPT. STERN and\ndeliver that parcel to him?
DOCK: Shipbuilding is an art.\cA lot of things can't be figured out\njust by calculating.\cI really could use advice from a veteran\nwho knows the seas…
DOCK: Hi! MR. BRINEY's joined us to\nlend us his help.\cThanks to the veteran sailor, the\nferry is steadily coming together.
DOCK: The ferry is finally ready!\cThe new S.S. TIDAL is truly a marvel\nof technology!\cBut, I get the feeling that we can\nmake something even better.\cYou know, there's never an end to\ntechnology's march.
MR. BRINEY: Ah, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nIt's been too long!\cAye, since I met you, this old sea dog's\nbeen feeling frisky!\cSo I've decided to help DOCK make\na ferry.\cAye, after all, a ferry would be able\nto carry a lot of people.\cBut, you know, that DOCK is really\nsomething special.\cWith his knack for technology and\nmy experience, I'm sure that we can\rbuild one great ship, aye!
The seasons, the weather, where\nthe moon sits in the sky…\cThese and other conditions make\nthe sea change its expression.\cThat's right!\nThe sea is like a living thing!
I get seasick real easily.\nSo I get to help out here instead.
Designing a large ship is more like\nmaking a big building than putting\rtogether a transportation vehicle.
Don't you think it's strange that\na ship made of heavy iron floats?\cIt floats because of a principle\ncalled buoyancy.
So, like, I couldn't find myself any\nPOKéMON that were, like, for me.\cSo, I figured, like, hey, I should file\na complaint to the guy there?\cAnd he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!\nSo, like, total bummer, man!\cHey, like, you! Zip it, you know?\nJust, you know, take this!
That's, like, TM41, you know?\nHey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?\cLike, it won't let the other guy\nuse the same move twice in a row, see?\cHey, now, you listen here, like,\nI'm not laying a torment on you!
I don't really like BUG POKéMON,\nbut maybe I'll try using some for\ra change of pace.\cWho knows, I might even get to like\nthem!
You can battle all you want here even\nif you don't have any tough POKéMON.
Wouldn't it be nice if they had more of\na selection?
Want a tasty little bit of advice\nfor CONTESTS?\cUsing a certain move after another\ncertain kind of move sometimes gets\ryou extra attention.\cIf you know what you're doing,\nyou can score big in appeal.\cOf course, your opponents might try\ndisrupting your POKéMON's showing.
My papa, he's a CONTEST JUDGE.\cI wonder what I should be when I\ngrow up, a JUDGE or a GYM LEADER?
Hey, man, I'm like majorly cheesed,\nyou know. Like, you know, I just\rwanted to know why my POKéMON\rnever won, you know, like, hey?\cSo, like, I gave the JUDGE my two\ncents, you know, they're free.\cAnd he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!\nSo, like, total bummer, man!\cHey, like, you! Zip it, you know?\nJust, you know, take this!
That's, like, TM41, you know?\nHey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?\cLike, it won't let the other guy\nuse the same move twice in a row, see?\cHey, now, you listen here, like,\nI'm not laying a torment on you!
MC: Oh, my, my!\nNow isn't that a dandy of a POKéMON?\cPlease! Do step right up and take\npart in our splendid CONTESTS!\cYou'll do well! I'm sure of it!\nMy eyes have never failed me!
JUDGE: Well, hello there!\nI see that you're a TRAINER!\cThen, it just wouldn't do for you\nto miss a POKéMON CONTEST!\cGet a CONTEST PASS in VERDANTURF\nCITY and enter anytime!
It's appeal time!\nWhat should I lead with?
They didn't pay much attention to\nmy POKéMON's appeal…\cHumph, that JUDGE, he doesn't know\na good thing when he sees it.
Oh, hi! You must be a serious fan to get\nthis close to the action.\cI'll reward your enthusiasm with\nthis sage advice.\cIf a move goes over really well,\nthe audience will get excited.\cThe POKéMON that makes its appeal\nright when everyone's excited…\cWell, you'd think something good has\nto happen!
I can't do this! I'm more freaked out\nthan my POKéMON.\cI'm shivering and my heart is racing!
A battle and a CONTEST aren't the\nsame, but they are alike, too.\cYou need to work hard and believe\nin the POKéMON you've raised.
That POKéMON looks like it's on top\nof its game, huh?\cA POKéMON that does good in the\nsecondary judging seems to be more\rrelaxed when it's doing appeals.
Will you look at that sorry sight?\cHeh, my POKéMON's absolutely better\nthan that lot!
Don't you get the urge to move with\nPOKéMON if they're putting on an\renergetic appeal?
POKéMON CONTESTS\nHYPER RANK STAGE!
Hi, hi! I'm the NAME RATER!\nI'm the fortune-teller of names!\cI shall be pleased to rate your\nPOKéMON's nickname.
Which POKéMON's nickname should\nI critique?
Hmmm… [STR_VAR_1], is it? That is\nquite a fine name you bestowed.\cBut! What say you, if I were to\nsuggest a slightly better name?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!
I see.\nDo come visit again.
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\cHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm… [STR_VAR_1] it is!\cThis is a magnificent nickname!\nIt is impeccably beyond reproach!\cYou'll do well to cherish your\n[STR_VAR_1] now and beyond.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an EGG!
Er-hem! I am the CHAIRMAN of the\nPOKéMON FAN CLUB!\cBeing the CHAIRMAN, I am naturally\nthe most important!\cNo one can best me when it comes\nto raising POKéMON. No one!\cWell, let me tell you about\nPOKéMON CONTESTS.\cThey're events where one can show off\nPOKéMON for the world to see!\cHowever, they're held in far-off towns,\nso I cannot participate often enough.\cThat is why we gather here to show\noff our POKéMON, and have others\rshow us theirs.
The POKéMON of a TRAINER who has\nentered a POKéMON CONTEST…\rThat, I would like to see.
Er-hem! I see you've participated in\na POKéMON CONTEST!\cPlease! Allow me to examine how you\nhave raised your POKéMON.\cIt delights me no end to see POKéMON\nraised by other TRAINERS.\cThe happy expressions of POKéMON\nraised with proper care…\cThe kindly eyes of the TRAINER that\nnurtured and raised the POKéMON…\cThe very thought fills my heart to\noverwhelming with joy.\cOh! I do beg your pardon!\nForgive me for prattling on so!\cPlease! Allow me to examine how much\nyour POKéMON has grown!
How is your POKéMON growing?\nAllow me to examine it.
Hm, hm…\nI see…
Hmmm… It's not bad, but it's not\ngood, either…\cYou, the TRAINER, must put more\neffort into raising this POKéMON!\cFor instance, may I suggest that\nyou give it more [POKEBLOCK]S?
Oh, my…\cYour POKéMON is growing quite well,\nso you deserve a reward.\cUnfortunately, you have no space for\nthis in your BAG.
Your [STR_VAR_1], it is growing in\na most impressive manner!\rIt is one fine specimen!\cBut! If you were to give it this,\nit would grow even better! Indeed!
Let a POKéMON hold that RED SCARF.\cEveryone will recognize the coolness\nof that POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that BLUE SCARF.\cIts beauty will be accentuated much\nmore than now!
Let a POKéMON hold that PINK SCARF.\cIt will draw out the cuteness of\nthe POKéMON some more!
Let a POKéMON hold that GREEN SCARF.\cThat will enhance the\nsmartness of POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that YELLOW SCARF.\cIt will bolster your POKéMON's\ntoughness so much more!
I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to\ngive you! None at all!\cAfter all, you're blessed with the gift\nof raising POKéMON without resorting\rto any items!
I love seeing POKéMON that love\ntheir TRAINERS.\cPOKéMON are very sensitive to\nthe feelings of their TRAINERS.\cIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.\cWhen your POKéMON grow to love you,\nplease come show me.
Your POKéMON really adores you.\cFor you, a most compassionate\nTRAINER, a gift from the FAN CLUB!
POKéMON are very sensitive to\nthe feelings of their TRAINERS.\cIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.
If you keep letting a POKéMON faint\nin battle, it'll come to resent it.\cSoon, it will become less trusting\nof the TRAINER.\cIn other words, it certainly won't\nlike you very much.
Do POKéMON enjoy having items used\non them?\cMine acted really happy when I gave\nit some PROTEIN.
SKITTY: Fffnyaaaah…
ZIGZAGOON: Kyuuu…
AZUMARILL: Marimari?
Welcome to the OCEANIC MUSEUM.\cThe entrance fee is $50.\nWould you like to enter?
Please enjoy yourself.
Oh? I'm sorry, but you don't seem to\nhave enough money.
Oh? You're with that group that\nwent in earlier?\cYou're the only one who's late.\nYou'd better go catch up to them!
We, TEAM AQUA, exist for the good\nof all!
We were told to assemble here,\nso we did, but…\cOur BOSS, the linchpin, isn't here.
If I ripped off the stuff here,\nwould it make me rich?
What I learn here, I can put to use on\nnefarious deeds…
If our goons didn't bungle things\nin RUSTBORO, we wouldn't be here!
I didn't have $50, so it took a long\ntime getting by the receptionist.
I want to learn about the sea and\nuse that knowledge for battling.
I get all giddy and gooey when\nI see the sea!\cFor me, CAPT. STERN is the number\none role model!
The sea is vast without end, and\ninfinitely deep…\cThere must be many POKéMON that\nwe don't know about.
I want a sea POKéMON.\cI think it would feel cool and nice\nto hug.
Aiyeeeh!\nWhat are you doing here?\cMe? I'm the TEAM AQUA member\nyou thumped before, remember?\rBack in RUSTURF TUNNEL?\cHere, take this!\nYou have to forgive me!
That TM, it suits you more than it\ndoes me.\cHope I never see you again!\nWahahaha!
Awww, come on!\nYou have to take this and let me go!
A blue fluid is spiraling inside\na glass vessel.\c“This is an experiment to create a\nWHIRLPOOL artificially using wind.”
A red ball is bobbing up and down\ninside a glass vessel.\c“This is an experiment simulating a\nWATERFALL using the ball's buoyancy.”
It's a sample of soil from the ocean\nfloor.\c“Over many years, the remains of\nlife-forms settle at the bottom of\rthe sea, making sedimentary layers.\c“By analyzing these layers, the\nancient past is revealed.”
It's a sample of beach sand.\c“Stones from mountains are washed\ndown by rivers where they are\rchipped and ground down.\c“They are reduced to grains and end\nup as sand on beaches.”
“OCEANIC MINIFACT 1\nWhy is seawater blue?\c“Light is composed of many colors.\c“When light passes through water,\nmost kinds of light lose color.\c“However, blue light retains its\ncolor, making the sea appear blue.”
“OCEANIC MINIFACT 2\nWhy is the sea salty?\c“Seawater contains dissolved salt in\nthe form of sodium and chlorine ions.\c“These ions leech out of rocks\nand are carried out to sea by rain.\c“The concentration of dissolved salt\nmakes the sea salty.”
“OCEANIC MINIFACT 3\nWhich is bigger? The sea or land?\c“The sea covers about 70% of\nthe planet, and the rest is land.\c“The sea is therefore more than twice\nthe size of land.”
It's a fossil with wavy ridges on it.\c“Soil on the ocean floor gets scoured\nby the tide.\c“The flowing seawater marks the soil\nwith small ridges and valleys.\c“If this soil becomes fossilized, it is\ncalled a ripple mark.”
A strange machine is rotating under\na glass dome.\cMaybe it's for measuring the depth\nof something…
Yes? If you're looking for STERN,\nthat would be me.\cAh! Those must be the parts I ordered\nfrom MR. STONE of DEVON.\cThank you! That's great!\nWe can prepare for our expedition now.
Hehehe, hold it!\nWe'll take those parts!
CAPT. STERN: Wh-what?\nWho are you people?
We're TEAM AQUA!\cOur BOSS wants those parts!\nShut your yap and fork them over!
Awaaaah!\nA kid beat me!
Oh, man, what a disaster…\nThe BOSS is going to be furious…
Humph, sniveling wimp!\nLet me take care of this!
What?!\nI lost, too!
Now what? If we don't get the parts,\nwe're in for it!\cArrgh, I didn't count on being meddled\nwith by some meddling kid!
I came to see what was taking so\nlong to snatch some parts, and you\rsimps are held up by a mere child?
We are TEAM AQUA,\nand we love the sea!\cAnd I am TEAM AQUA's leader,\nARCHIE!\cWhat makes you interfere with us?\c…No! You can't be!\nYou're not one of TEAM MAGMA?\cWait, that can't be right.\nYou're not dressed for the part.\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cPOKéMON, people… All life depends on\nthe sea.\cSo, TEAM AQUA is dedicated to\nthe expansion of the sea.\cDon't you agree? What we are doing\nis a magnificent undertaking.\cAh, fine…\nYou're still too young to understand\rour noble objective.\cBut, I warn you, don't even consider\ninterfering with our plans again.\cThe consequences will cost you\ndearly!\cAnd don't you forget it!
CAPT. STERN: You're…\nAh, okay, you're [PLAYER][KUN]…\cAnyway, that was a tense situation!\nThank you for saving us!\cOh, yes, I almost forgot that you\neven brought the parts from DEVON!
CAPT. STERN: Whoops!\nThere's no time to lose!\cWe have to set out on our ocean-floor\nexpedition really soon.\cThanks again, but now I've got\nto go!\cFeel free to wander around and check\nout our facilities, though.
I saw a model of a ship here.\cIt reminded me of the ABANDONED SHIP\nnear DEWFORD TOWN…
Don't you dare run around inside\nthe MUSEUM!
Wow, the submarine's awesome!\nI want to go for a ride!
“WATER QUALITY SAMPLE 1,” the\nlabel says.\cThe sea is all connected, but the\nwater seems to differ by region.
“WATER QUALITY SAMPLE 2,” the\nlabel says.\cDoes the saltiness of seawater differ\nby region, too?
A rubber ball is expanding and\nshrinking.\c“In the sea, the weight of water itself\nexerts pressure.\c“In shallow water, the pressure is not\nvery heavy.\c“However, in extremely deep water,\nthe pressure can reach even tens of\rthousands of tons on a small area.”
“MODEL OF HOENN REGION”\cIt's a miniature diorama of the\nHOENN region.\cWhere is LITTLEROOT TOWN on this?
It's a display on the flow of seawater.\c“Near the bottom of the sea, water\nflows due to differences in such\rfactors as temperature and salinity.”
It's a display on the flow of seawater.\c“Toward the surface, seawater flows\nas currents driven by the winds.”
“THE FERRY S.S. TIDAL\c“A scale replica of the ship under\nconstruction at STERN'S SHIPYARD.”
“SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1\c“A replica of the high-performance\nocean floor exploration submarine.”
“SUBMERSIBLE POD\c“A replica of a compact, unmanned\npod for seafloor exploration.”
“S.S. ANNE\c“A replica of the luxury liner that\ncircles the globe.”
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\cI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present…
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET…\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
BATTLE FRONTIER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
A journey to the bottom of the sea…\nI wonder what it'd be like?\cI'd love to go deep underwater like\nthat someday.
For a ship to sail safely, we need to\nknow about the weather!\cSpeaking of weather, I heard something\nfrom a guy at the WEATHER INSTITUTE.\cHe was saying abnormal weather has\nbeen reported all over the place!\cYou should visit the WEATHER INSTITUTE\nand ask around!
I wanted to go with CAPT. STERN on\nthe ocean floor exploration.\cBut the sub's too small for me.\cIf I squeezed in, there wouldn't be\nany room for the CAPTAIN…
CAPT. STERN: Those thugs…\cThey're the same lot who tried to rob\nthe DEVON GOODS at the MUSEUM.
ARCHIE: Oh?\nNot you again…\cYou are tenacious to track us here,\nthat much I will give you.\cBut now…\nNo one can stop us! No one!\cOr, will you follow us back to our\nHIDEOUT in LILYCOVE CITY?\cFwahahahaha…
CAPT. STERN: Why…\cWhy would TEAM AQUA steal my\nSUBMARINE EXPLORER 1?\cThey can't be after the slumbering\nPOKéMON at the bottom of the sea…\cBut even if I were to chase them,\nI don't stand a chance against them…
CAPT. STERN: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]…\cOkay… So TEAM AQUA left before you\ncould stop them…\cOh, no, don't blame yourself.\nYou're not responsible for this.\cTrying to catch a submarine…\nIt's impossible for most people.\cYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE…\cPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY…\cA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you…
CAPT. STERN: Trying to catch a\nsubmarine… It's impossible.\cYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE…\cPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY…\cA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you…
CAPT. STERN: Oh, yes.\nMR. BRINEY came to our SHIPYARD.\cIt won't be long now before we finish\nmaking the ferry!
CAPT. STERN: [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWe finally finished making the ferry\nS.S. TIDAL!\cWe couldn't have done it without\nyour friend MR. BRINEY.\cPlease go for a short cruise on it!
CAPT. STERN: Oh?\n[PLAYER][KUN], that item you have…\cThat's a SCANNER! That would sure\nhelp us on our explorations.\c[PLAYER][KUN], would you trade your\nSCANNER for something?\cLike, say, a DEEPSEATOOTH or\na DEEPSEASCALE that I have?
CAPT. STERN: Are you certain?\nIt's useless to you, [PLAYER][KUN]…\cWell, okay, then. If you want to trade\nyour SCANNER, let me know.
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEATOOTH?
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEASCALE?
CAPT. STERN: Which one do you want?
[PLAYER] handed the SCANNER to\nCAPT. STERN.
CAPT. STERN: Thanks, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nThis will help our research a lot!
My POKéMON has a HASTY nature.\cIt has higher SPEED compared to\nmy other POKéMON.\cMaybe their nature has something to\ndo with the stat gains of POKéMON.
You're a TRAINER, aren't you?\cSince you came to SLATEPORT CITY,\nyou must be going to the BATTLE TENT.
Want a tip for battling?\cI'd say it's raising different kinds\nof POKéMON in a balanced manner.\cIt's no good to make just one\nPOKéMON strong.\cIf it has a type disadvantage,\nit might not stand a chance.
I trade POKéMON with my friends.\cIf a traded POKéMON is holding an\nitem, it makes me twice as happy!
The MARKET does have some interesting\nmerchandise.\cBut there are some items you can only\nget at a POKéMON MART.
A GREAT BALL is better than a POKé BALL\nat catching POKéMON.\cWith this, I should be able to get that\nelusive POKéMON…
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cWATTSON, the LEADER of MAUVILLE\nGYM, uses ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.\cIf you challenge him with WATER-type\nPOKéMON, he'll zap them! Bzzt!\cAnd, he's put in switch-controlled\ndoors all over his GYM! Eccentric!\cHey, go for it!
Whoa, you're electrifying!\nYou've powered the door open!
My electric soul, it'll shatter your\ndreams whole, whoa-yeahah!
That was plugged in, amped up,\nover-driven electric, man!
POKéMON and rock, it's all about heart,\nwhoa-yeah!
I trained under WATTSON!\nThere ain't no way I'll lose easily!
Unplugged and turned off…
WATTSON, our GYM LEADER, has been\naround for a long, long time.\cHe was battling even before your\ndaddy was born, that tough coot.
This GYM's got puzzles!\nIsn't it fun?
It's no fun to lose…
WATTSON says he likes setting up\nlittle traps with switches.
With my charm and my POKéMON's moves,\nyou'll be shocked!
I'm shocked by your power!
I've heard that MAUVILLE was founded\nby WATTSON.\cHe was a TRAINER long before we\nbecame TRAINERS.\rHe must know all sorts of things!
I love shiny things!
Oh…\nMy eyes are frazzled…
MAUVILLE GYM's WATTSON has a shiny\nforehead. It makes me happy!
I've given up on my plans to convert\nthe city, I have.\cAnd so, I put my time into making\ndoor traps in my GYM.\cOh? Now, what are you doing here?\cWhat's that? You say you've gotten\npast all my rigged doors?\cWahahahah!\nNow, that is amusing!\cThen, I, WATTSON, the LEADER of\nMAUVILLE GYM, shall electrify you!
Wahahahah!\nFine, I lost!\cYou ended up giving me a thrill!\nTake this BADGE!
[PLAYER] received the DYNAMO BADGE\nfrom WATTSON.
With the DYNAMO BADGE, POKéMON can\nuse ROCK SMASH out of battle.\cAnd, it will make your POKéMON a little\nbit faster, too.\cHmm…\nYou should take this, too!
That TM34 there contains SHOCK WAVE.\cIt's a trustworthy move that never\nmisses! You can count on it!\c… … … … … …
Registered GYM LEADER WATTSON\nin the POKéNAV.
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising\nyoung TRAINER like you!
Wahahahah!\nGo forth and endeavor, youngster!
MAUVILLE CITY POKéMON GYM
MAUVILLE CITY POKéMON GYM\cWATTSON'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n[PLAYER]
WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\rYou want to battle my POKéMON!\cWahahahaha!\cI'll make sparks fly from you!\nDon't say I didn't warn you!
Oof…\nOur batteries ran dry…
WATTSON: We'll have to recharge our\nbatteries again.\cWhen we're fully charged up, we'll\ngladly accept your challenge.\cSo, come back again sometime,\nwon't you?
WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\rYou want to battle my POKéMON!\cWahahahaha!\cOops! Wait!\nYou've only one POKéMON with you!\cCome see me with two or more\nPOKéMON, all right?
Well, well, what have we here?\nA most energetic customer!\cMe? You may call me RYDEL.\nI'm the owner of this cycle shop.
RYDEL: Your RUNNING SHOES…\nThey're awfully filthy.\cDid you come from far away?
RYDEL: Is that right?\cThen, I guess you have no need for\nany of my BIKES.
RYDEL: Hm, hm… … … … …\cYou're saying that you came all this\nway from LITTLEROOT?\cMy goodness!\nThat's ridiculously far!\cIf you had one of my BIKES, you could\ngo anywhere easily while feeling the\rgentle caress of the wind!\cI'll tell you what!\nI'll give you a BIKE!\cOh, wait a second!\cI forgot to tell you that there are\ntwo kinds of BIKES!\cThey are the MACH BIKE and\nthe ACRO BIKE!\cThe MACH BIKE is for cyclists who want\nto feel the wind with their bodies!\cAnd an ACRO BIKE is for those who\nprefer technical rides!\cI'm a real sweetheart, so you can\nhave whichever one you like!\cWhich one will you choose?
[PLAYER] chose the MACH BIKE.
[PLAYER] chose the ACRO BIKE.
RYDEL: If you get the urge to switch\nBIKES, just come see me!
RYDEL: Oh? Were you thinking about\nswitching BIKES?
RYDEL: Okay, no problem!\nI'll switch BIKES for you!
[PLAYER] got the MACH BIKE exchanged\nfor an ACRO BIKE.
[PLAYER] got the ACRO BIKE exchanged\nfor a MACH BIKE.
RYDEL: Good, good!\nI'm happy that you like it!
Oh? What happened to that BIKE\nI gave you?\cOh, I get it, you stored it using your PC.\cWell, take it out of PC storage,\nand I'll be happy to exchange it!\cMay the wind always be at your back\non your adventure!
I'm learning about BIKES while\nI work here.\cIf you need advice on how to ride your\nBIKE, there're a couple handbooks in\rthe back.
It's a handbook on the MACH BIKE.\cWhich page do you want to read?
A BIKE moves in the direction that\nthe + Control Pad is pressed.\cIt will speed up once it gets rolling.\cTo stop, release the + Control Pad.\nThe BIKE will slow to a stop.\cWant to read a different page?
A MACH BIKE is speedy, but it can't\nstop very quickly.\cIt gets a little tricky to get around\na corner.\cRelease the + Control Pad a little\nbefore the corner and slow down.\cWant to read a different page?
There are small sandy slopes\nthroughout the HOENN region.\cThe loose, crumbly sand makes it\nimpossible to climb normally.\cBut if you have a MACH BIKE, you can\nzip up a sandy slope.\cWant to read a different page?
It's a handbook on the ACRO BIKE.\cWhich page do you want to read?

Woohoo!\cI hear people call me the ROCK SMASH\nGUY, but I find that sort of degrading.\cI think I deserve a bit more respect,\nlike maybe the ROCK SMASH DUDE.\cWoohoo!\cAnyways, your POKéMON look pretty\nstrong.\cI like that!\nHere, take this HIDDEN MACHINE!
That HM contains ROCK SMASH.\cIf you come across large boulders\nthat block your path…\cWell, use that HM move and smash\nthem right out of your way!\cYes, sir! Smash rocks aside, I say!\nWoohoo!
Oh, yes, if you smash a rock, a POKéMON\ncould come flying out of hiding.\cWoohoo!
This is MAUVILLE GAME CORNER.
Okay, you wanted some COINS for\nthe games?\cBut you don't have a COIN CASE for\nstowing the COINS.
Were you looking for COINS?\cIt's $1000 for 50 COINS.\nWould you like some?
Thank you very much!\nHere are your COINS!
Um… You don't appear to have\nenough money…
Oh?\nYour COIN CASE is full.
Oh… You don't need COINS, then?\nGood luck on your adventure!
Welcome.\cYou can exchange your COINS for\nprizes here.
Which prize would you like?
So your choice is\nthe [STR_VAR_1] [STR_VAR_2]?
Thank you!\nWe'll send it to your PC at home.
You don't have enough COINS.
There isn't any room available for\nplacing [STR_VAR_1].
Oh, is that so? \nYou need to save some COINS before\rcoming back here.
So your choice is [STR_VAR_1]?
Here you go!
Oh, you can't carry any more than that.
I made a mistake and got two of\nthe same DOLLS.\cWould you like one of them?
Here you go!
Huh?\nYou want it, but not right now?
Oh, don't be so negative!\nYou can have this!
There's a prize I want, but I can't win\nthe jackpot.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a COIN CASE.\cI think the young lady next door\nhad one. Go see her!
My luck can only last so long.\nThis is too much for me.\rHere, take some COINS!
MAUVILLE has something for\neveryone.\cFor me, it's the GAME CORNER.
The ROULETTE tables have different\nrates.\cCheck your COINS if you're going to\npick a table.
It's easy to lose track of time in here. \nI should get back to work.
COINS are needed to play here\nin the GAME CORNER.
This ROULETTE thing…\nIt's rather demanding.\cWin or lose, it's only by luck.
Up to three COINS can be used to play\nthe SLOTS.
It's very difficult to make it stop\nright on “7.”\cIf it stops on “7” during the REEL TIME\nbonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.
Here's some information for you\nabout the SLOTS.\cThe more lightning bolts you stock,\nthe more REEL TIME chances you get.\cIn a game with the maximum five\nREEL TIME chances…\cIt is possible to receive four regular\nbonuses, then a big bonus.\cThat would total 660 COINS, but it's\nvery difficult to get.
You can't play if you don't have\na COIN CASE.
If I had a BIKE, it'd be easy to cycle to\nSLATEPORT for some shopping.\cI'd be able to buy HARBOR MAIL at the\nPOKéMON MART in SLATEPORT…
Oh! You have HARBOR MAIL?\nWill you trade it for a COIN CASE?
Oh, I'm so happy!\nOkay, I'll trade you a COIN CASE!
That COIN CASE can be used\nat the GAME CORNER.
Oh, that's disappointing.\cA COIN CASE is needed for the\nGAME CORNER.
That man over there, he says weird\nthings!\cHe's funny in a weird way.\nI doubt I'll forget about him!
When I accessed the RECORD CORNER,\nthe data for what's hot in DEWFORD\rgot updated.\cNow that bit of data is the same\nas my friend's!
A RECORD CORNER opened upstairs in\nthe POKéMON CENTER.\cI don't know what it's about, but it\nsounds fun. I'll go check it out!
Did you know that you can link battle\nat the COLOSSEUM here?\cThey put up your record on the wall\nfor everyone to see.\cIt's embarrassing if you lose more\noften than you win…
There are items that temporarily\nelevate the stats of POKéMON.\cThe ones I know you use in battle\nare X ATTACK and X DEFEND…\cI do believe that there are others\nlike them.
Use a certain move, or use an item\ninstead…\cThe TRAINER's decisions determine how\nbattles turn out, I think.
Hello and welcome to the DEVON\nCORPORATION.\cWe're proud producers of items and\nmedicine that enhance your life.
One of our research staff stupidly\ngot robbed of an important parcel.
Hey, those RUNNING SHOES!\nThey're one of our products!\cIt makes me happy when I see someone\nusing something we made.
That stolen parcel…\cWell, sure it's important, but it's not\nanything that anyone can use.\cIn my estimation, that robber must not\nhave been very bright.
It sounds like they've recovered\nthe ripped-off DEVON GOODS.
I'm sorry, only authorized people\nare allowed to enter here.
It's beyond stupid.\nHow could we get robbed?
Hi, there!\nYou're always welcome here!
Samples of rocks and metal are\ndisplayed in the glass case.\cThere's a panel with some writing\non it…\c“DEVON CORPORATION got its start as\na producer of stones from quarries.\c“The company also produced iron from\nfilings in the sand.\c“From that humble start as a producer\nof raw materials, DEVON developed.\c“DEVON is now a manufacturer of a wide\nrange of industrial products.”
Prototypes and test products fill\nthe glass display case.\cThere's a panel with a description…\c“In addition to industrial products,\nDEVON now markets sundries and\rpharmaceuticals for better lifestyles.\c“Recently, DEVON has begun marketing\ntools for POKéMON TRAINERS, including\rPOKé BALLS and POKéNAV systems.”
We're developing a device for talking\nwith POKéMON.\cBut we haven't had much success…
I'm developing new kinds of\nPOKé BALLS…\cBut I haven't made much headway…
We finally made new kinds of\nPOKé BALLS!\cThe REPEAT BALL makes it easier to\ncatch POKéMON you've caught before.\cThe TIMER BALL gets better at catching\nPOKéMON the longer a battle runs.\cBoth are proudly developed by\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\cPlease give them a try!
I made the POKéNAV!\cAs an engineer, I feel blessed to have\nmade something so great!
Oh, wow!\nThat's a POKéNAV!\cIt came about as a result of our\nPRESIDENT's desire to learn about\rthe feelings of POKéMON.\cWould you like me to describe its\nfeatures in detail?\cNo, no. I think you'll find out just by\ntrying the POKéNAV out.
I'm trying to develop a device that\nvisually reproduces the dreams of\rPOKéMON…\cBut it's not going well.
I've been trying to develop a device\nthat resurrects POKéMON from fossils…\cAnd, it's working!
Wait! That thing you have there…\nIs that a POKéMON fossil?\cWould you like to bring that POKéMON\nback to life?\cI can with my newly developed\nFOSSIL REGENERATOR.
Oh, is that so?\cDEVON's technological expertise\nis outstanding, I tell you.
Oh, now that's a surprise!\nYou have not one, but two, fossils?\cUnfortunately, my machine can only\nregenerate one POKéMON at a time.\cWould you like to pick one of your\nfossils for regeneration?
Excellent!\nLet's do this right away.\c[PLAYER] handed the [STR_VAR_1] to\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.
The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made,\nis incredible.\cBut it has one drawback--it takes\na long time to work.\cSo, uh… How about you go for a stroll\nand look around for a while?
Thanks for waiting!\cYour fossilized POKéMON has been\nbrought back to life!\cThe fossil was an ancient POKéMON.\n[STR_VAR_2], it was!
[PLAYER] received [STR_VAR_2] from\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.
Uh-oh, you've got too many POKéMON.\nYou have no room for this one.
I'm trying to develop a new feature\nfor the POKéNAV…\cBut it's not going well.
Well, now what shall I work on\ndeveloping next?\cOur company allows us to make our\ninspirations into reality.\cOne couldn't ask for a better\nenvironment as an engineer.
I'm MR. STONE, the PRESIDENT of\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\cI'd just got word about you!\cYou saved our staff not just once,\nbut twice!\cI have a favor to ask of an amazing\nperson like you.\cI understand that you're delivering\na package to SLATEPORT's SHIPYARD.\cWell, on the way, could you stop off in\nDEWFORD TOWN?\cI was hoping that you'd deliver a\nLETTER to STEVEN in DEWFORD.
MR. STONE: Now, you should know that\nI am a great PRESIDENT.\cSo, I'd never be so cheap as to ask\na favor for nothing in return.\cThat's why I want you to have this!
[PLAYER] received a POKéNAV.
MR. STONE: That device…\cIt's a POKéMON NAVIGATOR, or POKéNAV\nfor short.\cIt's an indispensable tool for any\nTRAINER on an adventure.\cIt has a map of the HOENN region.\cYou can check the locations of\nDEWFORD and SLATEPORT easily!\cBy the way, I've heard that sinister\ncriminals--MAGMA and AQUA, I believe--\rhave been making trouble far and wide.\cI think it would be best if you rested\nup before you go on your way.
MR. STONE: Well, then, [PLAYER][KUN],\ngo with caution and care!
MR. STONE: I'm counting on you!
MR. STONE: You delivered my LETTER?\nThank you kindly!\cThis is my way of thanking you.\nIt should help you, a TRAINER.
MR. STONE: A POKéMON holding that\nEXP. SHARE will be given some of the\rEXP Points from battle.\cIt will get EXP Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\cI would say EXP. SHARE is quite useful\nfor raising weak POKéMON.
MR. STONE: Since my youth, I've immersed\nmyself in work.\cConsequently, I'm not familiar with\ntrends and that sort of thing.\cBut do young people all want to be\nTRAINERS in the POKéMON LEAGUE?
This is the DEVON CORPORATION's\nthird floor.\cOur PRESIDENT's OFFICE is on\nthis floor.\cAnyway, I can't tell you how much I'm\ngrateful for what you've done.\cUm… By the way, that parcel\nyou got back for us…\cCould I get you to deliver that to\nthe SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT?\cIt would be awful if those robbers\ntried to take it again.\cUh… Hehehe, so, uh, could I count\non you to do that for me?\cOh, that's right.\nCould you wait here a second?
Our PRESIDENT would like to have\na word with you.\cPlease come with me.
Please, go ahead.
If you visit the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT,\nyou should go see CAPT. STERN.
DEVON's new products, the REPEAT BALL\nand TIMER BALL, have become hugely\rpopular among TRAINERS.
It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by the PRESIDENT.
Yo, how's it going?\cListen, my friend!\nWould you like to become the CHAMPION?\cI'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can\nsure give you winning advice.\cThat's settled, then! We'll aim for the\nPOKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!\cIt's your job as a TRAINER to collect\nGYM BADGES, am I right?\cBut GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!\cAnd that's where I come in!\nI'm here to provide expert advice!\cROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user\nof ROCK-type POKéMON.\cThe ROCK type is very durable, but\nit can't stand WATER-type and\rGRASS-type moves.\cCome see me afterwards, if you beat\nthe GYM LEADER.\cWell, go for it!
Whoa! What a breathtaking victory!\nMy cheering must've worked!\cGreat!\nCheck your TRAINER CARD.\cThe STONE BADGE you got should be\nproperly recorded on it.\cIn other words…\cYou've climbed the first step on\nthe stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!\cThat's got to feel awesome!
Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly!\nI'll show you why we're better!
You were too good for me…
You haven't seen anything of the ROCK\ntype's terrifying power!
If you can't beat me, you won't stand\na chance against ROXANNE!
Wow! You've got some potential!
ROXANNE is stronger than me by\nseveral times.\cYou'd better be on your guard!
We might be in the middle of town,\nbut so what?\cMy ROCK POKéMON need room to\nrampage!
Oh, man oh man!\nOur challenger is one feisty customer!
I have to hand it to our LEADER.\cIt took smarts and sense for her to\npick the ROCK type at her young age.
Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO\nPOKéMON GYM LEADER.\cI became a GYM LEADER so that I might\napply what I learned at the POKéMON\rTRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.\cWould you kindly demonstrate how you\nbattle, and with which POKéMON?
So…\nI lost…\cIt seems that I still have much more\nto learn…\cI understand.\cThe POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state\nthat TRAINERS are to be given this\rif they defeat a GYM LEADER.\cPlease accept the official POKéMON\nLEAGUE STONE BADGE.
[PLAYER] received the STONE BADGE\nfrom ROXANNE.
The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK\npower of your POKéMON.\cIt also enables them to use the HM move\nCUT outside of battle.\cPlease take this with you, too.
That TECHNICAL MACHINE, TM39,\ncontains ROCK TOMB.\cIt not only inflicts damage by dropping\nrocks, it also lowers SPEED.\cIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches\nthe move to a POKéMON.\cRemember, a TM can be used only once,\nso think before you use it.
Since you are so strong, you should\nchallenge other GYM LEADERS.\cBy battling many TRAINERS, you should\nlearn many things.

Registered GYM LEADER ROXANNE\nin the POKéNAV.
ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again.\nI'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\cI'm sure we've both experienced many\nbattles since we last met.\cI would like to see how much better\nwe've become. Let us battle!
Grr…\nAgain, I have lost…
ROXANNE: I still have much to learn\nwhen it comes to battling POKéMON.\cThat awareness makes me love battling\nall that much more!
ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again.\nI'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\cI'm sure we've both experienced many\nbattles since we last met.\cI would like to see how much better\nwe've become…\cOh, no…\nYou only have one POKéMON with you?\cPlease return with at least one more\nPOKéMON.
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect POKéMON in battle.
Which topic do you want to read?
If a POKéMON is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\cThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\cA poisoned POKéMON's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\cHeal a poisoning using an ANTIDOTE.
If a POKéMON becomes paralyzed,\nits SPEED drops.\cIt may also not be able to move while\nit is in battle.\cParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a PARLYZ HEAL.
If a POKéMON falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\cA POKéMON may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\rsleeping, it will stay asleep.\cWake it up using an AWAKENING.
A burn reduces ATTACK power, and it\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\cA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a BURN HEAL.
If a POKéMON is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\cIt will remain frozen after battle.\nThaw it out using an ICE HEAL.
Students who don't study get a little\ntaste of my QUICK CLAW.\cWhether or not you are a good student \nwill be evident from the way you use\rthis item.
A POKéMON holding the QUICK CLAW will\noccasionally speed up and get to move\rbefore its opponent.\cThere are many other items that are\nmeant to be held by POKéMON.\cJust those alone will give you many\ntopics to study!
I'm trading POKéMON with my friend\nright now.
I always wanted a SEEDOT, and\nI'm finally getting one!
POKéMON can hold items, but they\ndon't know what to do with man-made\ritems like POTION and ANTIDOTE.
You know how some POKéMON moves can\nconfuse a POKéMON?\cA confused POKéMON will sometimes\nattack itself without meaning to.\cBut once it leaves battle, it will\nreturn to normal.
A POKéMON holding a BERRY will heal\nitself…\cThere are many kinds of items that\nPOKéMON can hold…\cBoy, it sure is hard taking notes\ndown…
It's this student's notebook…\cPOKéMON are to be caught using\nPOKé BALLS.\cUp to six POKéMON can accompany\na TRAINER.\cA TRAINER is someone who catches\nPOKéMON, raises them, and battles\rwith them.\cA TRAINER's mission is to defeat\nthe strong TRAINERS who await\rchallengers in POKéMON GYMS.
Hello? Didn't we meet before?\nI think back in PETALBURG CITY.\cLet me introduce myself.\nMy name's SCOTT.\cI've been traveling everywhere in\nsearch of outstanding TRAINERS.\cMore specifically, I'm looking for\nPOKéMON battle experts.\cSo, what brings you to this SCHOOL?\nAre you a TRAINER, too?\cThe first thing you should do is to\nhave a POKéMON learn the move CUT.\cIf I remember correctly, someone in\nthis town has CUT.
SCOTT: Hmm…\cThe talent levels of the students here\nare unknown. The potential's there.
SCOTT: Oh, what's that?\cIt's a STONE BADGE, isn't it?\nThat's pretty impressive, I'd say.\cBut, you know, I would've loved to see\nyou in battle.\cIt's hard to tell what you're like as\na TRAINER from a LEAGUE BADGE.
Hello? Didn't we meet before?\nI think back in PETALBURG CITY.\cLet me introduce myself.\nMy name's SCOTT.\cI've been traveling everywhere in\nsearch of outstanding TRAINERS.\cMore specifically, I'm looking for\nPOKéMON battle experts.\cOh, what's that?\nIt's a STONE BADGE, isn't it?\cThat's pretty impressive, I'd say, for\na starting TRAINER like yourself.\cBut, you know, I would've loved to see\nyou in battle.\cIt's hard to tell what you're like as\na TRAINER from a LEAGUE BADGE.
My POKéMON has a NAIVE nature, and my\nfriend's has a JOLLY nature.\cIt's fascinating how POKéMON have\npersonalities!
Just like people, there are male and\nfemale POKéMON.\cBut no one seems to have any idea how\nthey're different.
The man next door gave me an HM!\cI used it to teach my POKéMON how to\nCUT down skinny trees.
I'm buying some PARLYZ HEALS and\nANTIDOTES.\cJust in case I run into SHROOMISH\nin PETALBURG WOODS.
My POKéMON evolved.\nIt has a lot of HP now.\cI should buy SUPER POTIONS for it\ninstead of ordinary POTIONS.
I'm getting an ESCAPE ROPE just in\ncase I get lost in a cave.\cI just need to use it to get back to\nthe entrance.
Every POKéMON has a special ability\nthat it can use.
POKéMON are such strange creatures.
Oh, it's so hard every day…\cWhat's hard?\nYou need to ask?\cIt's trying to figure out what to\nmake for meals every day.\cIt really isn't easy coming up with\nmeals every day.
Oh, hello!\nWelcome to the PEPPER household.\cI have a question for you.\nHave you ever baby-sat?\cYou see, I'm a new father, so raising\na child is all new to me.\cAnd I have a problem. My daughter\nWALDA doesn't laugh enough.\cI think she'd laugh for me if I told\nher something funny.\cDo you know of a funny word or\nphrase you can tell me?
I've been saying “[STR_VAR_1]”\nto amuse her lately.\cDo you know of a better word or\na phrase that might work?
Oh, that's wonderful.\nSo, let's hear it, your suggestion.
Oh, is that right?\cWell, if you come up with a good\nsuggestion, I'm all ears.
Ah, I see.\nWell, let's give it a try, shall we?
[STR_VAR_1].\n[STR_VAR_1].\cOh, yes! She's laughing!\nOh, I am as delighted as she!
Ah, I see.\nWell, let's give it a try, shall we?
[STR_VAR_1].\n[STR_VAR_1].\cHmmm… She's not smiling at all.\nMaybe WALDA is one serious child…
Oh, so you don't know any good words.\nI'd better think for myself, then.\cHmm…\nHow about “[STR_VAR_1]”?\rLet's see if that will work.
[STR_VAR_1].\n[STR_VAR_1].\cHmmm… She's not smiling at all.\nMaybe WALDA is one serious child…
Oh, so you don't know any good words.\nI guess I'll try to amuse her with\rthe saying I used before.\cAnyways, if you have a good suggestion,\ndon't hesitate in telling me, okay?
Thank you!\cThanks to you, my darling WALDA\nlaughed for me!\cActually, I may not look all that\nspecial, but I'm one of DEVON\rCORPORATION's top researchers.\cSo, how about I do something in return\nfor you?\cI know, I'll add some new wallpaper\npatterns for the BOXES in the PC\rPOKéMON Storage System.\cIn the wallpaper pattern menu,\nselect “FRIENDS.”\cThat will give you access to the new\nwallpaper patterns.
It's a POKéMON plush DOLL!
Huh? My POKéMON is cute?\nSure, I knew that.\cBut if you really want, I'm willing\nto trade it to you.\cI'll trade you my [STR_VAR_2] for\na [STR_VAR_1] if you want.
Eheheh…\nPlease be good to my POKéMON.
Huh? That doesn't look anything like\na [STR_VAR_1] to me.
Oh, if you don't want to, that's okay.\nBut my POKéMON is cute, you know…
Any POKéMON can be cute if you raise\nit with care and kindness.
In all sorts of places, there are all\nsorts of POKéMON and people.\cI find that fascinating, so I go to all\nsorts of places.
That determined expression…\nThat limber way you move…\rAnd your well-trained POKéMON…\cYou're obviously a skilled TRAINER!\cNo, wait, don't say a word.\nI can tell just by looking at you.\cI'm sure that you can put this\nHIDDEN MACHINE to good use.\cNo need to be modest or shy.\nGo on, take it!
That HIDDEN MACHINE, or HM for\nshort, is CUT.\cAn HM move is one that can be used\nby POKéMON outside of battle.\cAny POKéMON that's learned CUT can\nchop down thin trees if the TRAINER\rhas earned the STONE BADGE.\cAnd, unlike a TM, an HM can be used\nmore than once.
When they were expanding the city of\nRUSTBORO, my dad helped out.\cHe made his POKéMON use CUT to clear\nthe land of trees.
The TRAINER'S SCHOOL is excellent.\cIf you study there, you could even\nbecome a GYM LEADER.
ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, really knows\na lot about POKéMON.\cShe's really strong, too!
DEVON CORPORATION's workers live in\nthis building.
SKITTY: Gyaaaah!
Way back in the old days, DEVON was just\na teeny, tiny company.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\cMy daddy made this!\nBut I can't use it, so you can have it.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\cWhen I grow up, I'm going to work for\nDEVON, too.
DEVON's PRESIDENT likes to collect\nrare stones.
I think the PRESIDENT's son also\ncollects rare stones.
For my own POKéMON, I give them\nperfectly suited nicknames!\cIt's my expression of, uh…\noriginality, yes, that's it!
But giving the name PEKACHU to\na PIKACHU? It seems pointless.\cI suppose it is good to use a name\nthat's easy to understand, but…
PEKACHU: Peka!
Wrooooaaar! I need it!\nI have to get me a [STR_VAR_1]!\rI'll do anything for it!\c…Uh… Did you hear that?\nMy shout from the bottom of my heart?\cHaving heard that, you will trade\nyour [STR_VAR_1] for my [STR_VAR_2],\rwon't you?
Oh, yeah, right on!\c[STR_VAR_1], welcome!\n[STR_VAR_2], you take care!
Uh, no, I don't think so.\nThat isn't a [STR_VAR_1].
No? You won't trade me?\nEven after I bared my heart to you?
I'm going to make VOLBEAT super\nstrong from this moment on!\cI hope you do the same with PLUSLE!
Trading POKéMON with others…\cIt's as if you're trading your own\nmemories with other people.
ZIGZAGOON: Gumomoh?
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cFORTREE GYM LEADER WINONA is\na master of FLYING-type POKéMON.\cShe's waiting at the back of this GYM,\nbehind the rotating doors.\cShe's waiting for new challengers\nwho are trying to take wing!\cOkay, go for it!
You did it!\nYou've achieved liftoff!
Behold the elegant battle style of\nBIRD POKéMON!
You…\nYou're strong…
A TRAINER has to be smart to keep\nup with unexpected turns of events.\cDo you have the smarts to get to\nour LEADER?
The lovers of BIRD POKéMON aspire\nto join this GYM.\cAs a member of the FORTREE GYM,\nI'm not allowed to lose!
It was too much of a load for me\nto bear…
The world is huge, and there are\ncountless tough TRAINERS.\cI'm going to keep training and make\nmyself even stronger.
There's no need for WINONA, our GYM\nLEADER, to deal with you!\cI'm plenty good enough for you!
WINONA, I…\nI lost!
WINONA is cute and she's strong.\nShe's the ultimate LEADER!\cBlush…
WINONA taught me personally!\nYou can't beat me easily!
I was beaten…
Thanks to WINONA, the people of\nFORTREE can live without fear.
When WINONA takes to battle, her face\nshines with beautiful determination…\cI'm not letting you witness that\nlovely sight!
Urk!\nI couldn't stop you.
You'd better watch it!\nDon't get distracted staring at WINONA\ror you'll go crashing down in a heap!
You'd better know that there are all\nsorts of FLYING-type POKéMON.\cYou do know that, right?
You seem to know your stuff!
Sure, you beat me all right.\nBut you'd better watch it! Our LEADER\rWINONA's POKéMON are all business.
I am WINONA. I am the LEADER of\nthe FORTREE POKéMON GYM.\cI have become one with BIRD POKéMON\nand have soared the skies…\cHowever grueling the battle, we have\ntriumphed with grace…\cWitness the elegant choreography\nof BIRD POKéMON and I!
Never before have I seen a TRAINER\ncommand POKéMON with more grace\rthan I…\cIn recognition of your prowess,\nI present to you this GYM BADGE.
[PLAYER] received the FEATHER BADGE\nfrom WINONA.
With the FEATHER BADGE, all POKéMON up\nto LV 70, even those received through\rtrades, will obey your every command.\cYou will also be able to use\nthe HM move FLY outside of battle.\cAnd this…\nThis is a gift from me.
TM40 contains AERIAL ACE.\cIts speed…\nNo POKéMON should be able to avoid it.\c… … … … … …

WINONA: We humans can never escape\ngravity's pull on the ground.\cBut by striving for excellence,\nwe have the power to soar!\cYou have scaled the pinnacle as\nthe reigning CHAMPION.\cPlease, allow me to see your power\nat full flight!
I failed to reach your height again…
WINONA: Even though I have lost,\nthe wings of my heart remain unbroken.\cI can rise and soar again and\nyet again.\cI am convinced of it!
WINONA: We humans can never escape\ngravity's pull on the ground.\cBut by striving for excellence,\nwe have the power to soar!\cYou have scaled the pinnacle as\nthe reigning CHAMPION.\cPlease, allow me to see your power\nat full flight!\cOh, no… Do you have but one\nPOKéMON with you?\cPlease return with two POKéMON\nat the very least.
Listen, kid, are you working\non a POKéDEX?\cHmm… Go to the SAFARI ZONE.\nThat's my suggestion.
Have you done anything at\nthe RECORD CORNER?\cIt's pretty neat. It mixes and matches\nthe records of TRAINERS.\cI don't know quite how it works,\nbut it's cool. It's exciting, even!
Oh, wow, you have a POKéNAV!\nAnd it's just like mine!\cDo you know about POKéNAV's\nMATCH CALL system?\cAccess it, and you can chat with\nregistered TRAINERS anytime.\cIt also shows you which TRAINERS\nwant a rematch with you.\cIt's really nifty! Those DEVON guys\nsure know what they're doing!
SUPER REPEL lasts a long time,\nand it gets the job done.\cIt's much better than an ordinary\nREPEL.
I always stock up on more items than\nI'm sure I'll need.\cYou never know what might happen.\nBetter to be safe than sorry!
A RARE CANDY makes a POKéMON grow\nimmediately by one level.
People… POKéMON…\cTheir hidden powers are aroused by\nliving in natural environments…
Let this old woman see if your hidden\npower has awoken…\cI hold a coin in my hand.\cNow, tell me, have I palmed it in\nthe right hand? Or in the left?
Oh! Yes, correct!\cWe shall try again.\cIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left?
Oh! Yes, correct!\cWe shall try again.\cIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left?
Oh! Splendid!\nYour hidden power has awoken!\cHere, take this and awaken the hidden\npower of your POKéMON.
HIDDEN POWER is a move that changes\nwith the POKéMON.
No, too bad.\nYou guessed wrong.
While speaking about POKéDEXES,\nI remembered something.\cI met this TRAINER, STEVEN, when\nI was searching for rare stones.\cHoo, boy, he had some amazing POKéMON\nwith him.\cThey weren't just rare, they were\ntrained to terrifying extremes!\cHe might even be stronger than the\nGYM LEADER in this town…
What's that thing you have there?\c… … … … … …\cOh, it's called a POKéDEX?\nIt's really awesome!
By being together with POKéMON,\npeople make more and more friends.\cAnd that brings the world closer\ntogether. I think it's wonderful!
There!\nGo, BIRD POKéMON!
Heheh, I asked my WINGULL to run\nan errand for me.
Good!\nWelcome back, WINGULL!\cHuh? What is this?\nWhat is it holding?\cA MENTAL HERB?\nIt must have picked it up somewhere.\cBut I'm not a TRAINER, so you can\nhave it.
Thanks to my WINGULL, I have friends\nwho live far away.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The tree houses of FORTREE are great!\cI think it's the number one town for\nliving together with POKéMON.
POKéMON and people have adapted to\nnature for survival.\cThere's no need to make nature\nconform to the way we want to live.
ZIGZAGOON: Bufuu!
Merchandise you buy here is sent to\nyour own PC.\cThat's fantastic! I wish they could\nalso deliver me home like that.
I'm buying a pretty desk and I'm\nputting my cute DOLLS on it.\cIf I don't, when I decorate my\nSECRET BASE, my DOLLS will get\rdirty or poked with splinters.
Hm, so they doubled the guests by\nusing POKéMON as attractions?\cHm, well, maybe I should make a cute\nPOKéMON our inn's mascot.\cI wonder if that will attract more\nguests to stay with us?
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\cSince that TEAM AQUA came to town,\nthe tourists have been staying away.
Hey, down in front!\nI can't see the TV!
Amazing! You're telling me a POKéMON\nfound someone's lost item?\cThat's something. If we had some smart\nPOKéMON like that…\cWe could recover anything that our\nguests mislaid…
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\cI heard that someone busted\nthe TEAM AQUA HIDEOUT.\cThanks to that, we just booked\na reservation from a big group.\cIt was a company called… Uh…\nGAME something…
Amazing! A house-sitting POKéMON\ncaught a burglar?\cThat's something. If we had a tough\nPOKéMON as a security guard…\cWe would be able to provide our guests\nwith greater safety.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV.\cOh, yes. A big group of guests arrived\na little while ago.\cThey booked in as GAME FREAK,\nso I guess they must make games.\cUh-oh, I'd better get working on\ntheir dinner!
I'm the GAME DESIGNER.\cOh, is that right?\nYou're working on a POKéDEX?\cIt's tough trying to complete it,\nbut don't give up.\cIf you do complete it, please come\nshow me.
Wow! That's awesome!\nYep, it's totally awesome!\cThis POKéDEX is completely filled!\nYou really must love POKéMON!\cI'm so impressed!\cLet me give you something in\nrecognition of your feat!
Me? You're talking to me?\nI'm the PROGRAMMER.\cI wonder what the SLOTS are\nlike here.
I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the\nPOKéMON of HOENN interesting?
The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey?\nTo battle against a cute TUBER…\cWhoop, it's so awesome!\cAnd the TWINS! Aren't they cute?\nA 2-on-2 battle with TWINS…\cWhoop, it's unbearably fun!
The sea breeze tickles my heart.\nIt feels wonderful here!
You never know when and where\npeople will challenge you.\cThat's why I never leave home without\nmy GAME BOY ADVANCE.
SCOTT: … … … … …\n… … … … … Zzz…\c… … … … … Huh?!\nOh, sorry, sorry! I was snoozing!\cI came to check out this POKéMON\nCONTEST thing.\cI have to admit, it does look quite\nentertaining, but…\cConsider me a purist--I prefer\nbattles and tough TRAINERS.\cBut that's just me.\c[PLAYER][KUN], I hope you'll enjoy everything\nlike the GYMS, CONTESTS, BATTLE TENT,\rthe whole works!
SCOTT: I think it does take strategy\nto win a CONTEST.\cDevising CONTEST strategies is one way\nof becoming a better TRAINER, I'd say.
Welcome to LILYCOVE MUSEUM.\cPlease take the time to enjoy our\ncollection of fantastic artwork\rfeaturing POKéMON.
I'm the CURATOR of this MUSEUM of\nfine arts.\cIt's heartening to see someone so\nyoung as you in our MUSEUM.\cHave you viewed our collection of\npaintings already?
Ah, then let me not disturb you.\nPlease, do take your time.
Oh? I do believe that you seem to\nbe a POKéMON TRAINER.\cHave you an interest in paintings,\ntoo?
I see…\cI'm honored that you would visit\nus in spite of that.
Ah, excellent!\nYou do like paintings!\cThen, may I ask you to come with me?
It's a very old painting.\nThe paint is peeling here and there.
It's an odd landscape with bizarre\nand fantastic scenery.
It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling\nwoman with a POKéMON on her lap.
It's a painting of a legendary POKéMON\nfrom long ago.\cThe artist painted this from\nimagination.
It's a painting of GRASS POKéMON\nswaying in a breeze.\cThey appear to be enjoying the wind's\ngentle caress.
It's a delicious-looking painting\nof BERRIES.\cThis painting could make you hungry!
It's a replica of a famous sculpture.\cIt depicts an ancient BIRD POKéMON.
It's a big POKé BALL carved from\na black stone.\cIt was apparently used in festivals\nin the olden days.
It's a huge stone tablet inscribed\nwith POKéMON and dense text in the\rsmall characters of an ancient,\runreadable language.
Hmmm…\nWhat works of great magnificence…
Battling with POKéMON is fun,\nI'll grant you that.\cBut one mustn't forget our love for\nthe fine arts.
This ART MUSEUM… Well, you could\nsee many fantastic paintings.\cAnd the CURATOR is a wonderful person.\cAmong artists like myself, this MUSEUM\nis an inspiration.
This lady is pretty!\nShe's like Mommy!
This POKéMON is adorable!\nJust like our little boy!
I'd heard that this ART MUSEUM got\nin some new paintings.\cSo, naturally I hurried over.\cAre the new paintings up on\nthe second floor?
Lately, the CURATOR has been\nunusually cheerful.\cI bet something good happened for him.\nDefinitely.
I aim to see many great paintings\nhere and learn from them.\cI have this dream of one day having\nmy artwork exhibited here.
The ART MUSEUM has become a favorite\ntourist destination.\cIt's great for LILYCOVE…\nNo, great for the HOENN region!\cThis is what I've heard--a lone TRAINER\nprocured all the paintings upstairs.
This is our special exhibit hall.
As you can plainly see, there is not\na single painting on exhibit.\cHere, I don't wish to exhibit works of\nso-called classical art.\cSuch classical works you can see on\nour ground floor.\cI wish to exhibit work that is far\ndifferent from the classics.\cArt, after all, is not restricted to old,\nfamous works!\cThis exhibit hall, I wish to fill it with…\cModern and vibrant artworks of\nPOKéMON seemingly ready to spring\rforth into glorious life!
I beg your pardon. I didn't intend\nto monopolize the conversation.\cNow, as you are young, and yet\nobviously well traveled…\cYou must encounter lively POKéMON\nand works of art depicting them.\cIf you were to come across such\na painting, may we ask you to obtain\rthe artist's permission to exhibit\rit here?
I wish to fill this exhibit hall with\nmodern and vibrant paintings of\rPOKéMON.
Thanks to you, we've added a new\npainting to our collection!\cI've heard it depicts your POKéMON.\nTruly magnificent!\cThank you so very, very much!
Ah! It's you!\n[PLAYER]!
Isn't this marvelous?\nThis collection of paintings!\cEach one of them flawless!\nNone better than another!\cThese paintings have attracted\nmore guests to our ART MUSEUM.\cSincerely, I thank you, [PLAYER].\nThis is my dream come true!
This is merely a token of my gratitude.
I will keep this for you until we\nmeet again.
Ah, so good to see you, [PLAYER]!\cIt's an honor to have you visit us\non your busy journeys.\cPlease, relax and do enjoy your\nvisit with us.
It's a picture frame with pink-colored\nadornments.
It's a picture frame with\nyellow-colored adornments.
It's a picture frame with\nblue-colored adornments.
It's a picture frame with\nred-colored adornments.
It's a picture frame with\ngreen-colored adornments.
It's a painting of POKéMON.
I've been away awhile, so the new\npaintings up here surprised me.\cI wish someone would paint my POKéMON\nthis pretty.
Well… So this is where they show\nthe topical POKéMON paintings.\cI see, these new paintings are indeed\nrather amusing.
Wow, is that right?\nThese paintings are of your POKéMON.\cIsn't that just the ultimate joy for\na TRAINER?
Yippee!\cThe lady at the reception counter\ngave me a case for [POKEBLOCK]S!
Make [POKEBLOCK]S and put them in there.\cWhen you make a [POKEBLOCK], everyone\nhas to put in a different BERRY.
Congratulations!\cI did a painting of your POKéMON to\ncommemorate its victory…\cWell, your POKéMON's appeals were\nso fantastic, it spurred me into\rpainting better than I usually do.\rLook, see?
What do you think? I'm confident in\nwhat I've done, but do you like it?\cA work of this caliber, it wouldn't look\nout of place in an art museum.\cHuh? An art museum really is looking\nfor paintings?\cDo you think I should take this there?
What, really? Then, sure, I will take\nthis painting there right now.\cI'll give it a proper title, too.\cI hope they'll like it and consider\nexhibiting this.\cPlease check if they did accept this.\nThank you!
Oh, that's right!\cAs a memento of me painting your\nPOKéMON, please take this.
[PLAYER] received a RIBBON.
[PLAYER] put the RIBBON on\n[STR_VAR_1].
Okay, see you!
Oh… Then, I guess I'll just take\nthis home with me…\cBut, you know, I would like to take\nthis to the art museum… Okay?
Oh, fine, that's the way it is.\nI will hang this in my own house.\cI'll just have to try harder next time.\nWell, be seeing you.
Hoo, boy… Master Rank CONTESTS,\nhere I come.\cThe world will know that my dearest\nPOKéMON is the cutest being in all\rexistence. The time has come!\rUheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of\nPOKéMON here.\cThat's why I make this place a regular\npart of my daily stroll.
Wow, coming out to a CONTEST is\na feast for these eyes!\cWould you look at all the POKéMON\nthat just scream to be painted?
The TOUGHNESS CONTEST is like\nextreme, man!\cThose muscular appeals…\nCascading sweat… I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care\non this POKéMON.\cIts condition is peaking.\nToday, victory is mine!
I made [POKEBLOCK]S with Mom, Dad, and\nBig Sister. They turned out great!\cI bet you can make smoother, better\n[POKEBLOCK]S if you have more people.
This POKéMON won the BEAUTY CONTEST\nhere before.\cWell, guess what? Today, I made it\nwin a SMARTNESS CONTEST!\cMy abilities scare even me…
I've entered a bunch of CONTESTS,\nso I'm seeing how things work.\cIf you're in a COOLNESS CONTEST,\ncool moves go over as appeals.\cBut smart moves and cute moves\ndon't go over well, for instance.
That young man who won earlier had\na whole bunch of different [POKEBLOCK]S.\cCan you win if you had that many\nof those things?
Whoa, isn't this place humongous!\cThe tension in the air… It's not\nlike a CONTEST hall in the sticks.
MC: Okay, SMART POKéMON and their\nTRAINERS, are you ready?!\cGive it your best showing!\nLet's appeal!
JUDGE: Are you enjoying this CONTEST?\cCome back with three friends, and\nall of you may enter a CONTEST!
Ayayayay…\nI entered the wrong CONTEST.\cI entered this tough POKéMON in\nthe SMARTNESS CONTEST…\cCome on, wow them with a smart-looking\nROCK SMASH.
I've spent many a year, and all my\nwisdom besides, raising this POKéMON\rto be smart.\cIt won't be easily bested by some\nyoung pup's POKéMON.\cMy dear wife, are you seeing this?
There it is!\cIf my POKéMON pulls a smart move next,\nthe audience's excitement will peak!
Oh, dear, no!\cMy darling ZUBAT's LEECH LIFE is so\ncute I kept using it over and over!\cBut these mean people don't appreciate\nit at all!
Kiyaaah! You're beautiful, Grandpa!
Even when TRAINERS enter the same\nkind of POKéMON, they all seem to use\rdifferent moves for appeals.\cIt's just like the way people have\ndifferent styles for battling.
I think the POKéMON look smarter\nthan their TRAINERS. By a lot.
When all's said and done, I still love\nSMARTNESS CONTESTS.\cThat intellectual green color…\nIt's so… So… Cool.
MC: Are you entering the BEAUTY\nCONTEST, too? Good luck!
JUDGE: Ah, every POKéMON here is\na model of pristine beauty!\cWhy, I almost forgot to score them!
A POKéMON this beautiful…\nThere isn't another one like it.\cEveryone's eyes will be glued to\nmy beauty.
Waaaah!\cI brushed and groomed my POKéMON\ncarefully for this CONTEST…\cBut I overdid it…\nMy POKéMON's coat turned all scraggly…\cWhat should I do?
This AURORA BEAM is so dazzling,\nthe JUDGE won't be able to see it.\cUh, wait a second…\nThat'll be meaningless, then!
This pretty POKéMON looks just like\nme when I was younger.\cRight when I said that, my husband\nspewed the coffee he was drinking.\cDid I say something funny?
You know, if I win at a BEAUTY\nCONTEST, sure it makes me\rhappy. More than usual, anyway.
Wahahahah!\cWill you take a gander at all those\npretty POKéMON!\rI just love this sort of glitz!
You can't always win on just beauty\nalone.\cYou have to groom your POKéMON so\nit's nice and glossy like mine.
MC: Uh-oh! Hello!\nWe're in the middle of a CONTEST!\cPlease enter at our registration\ncounter and come out, okay?
JUDGE: Oh, such charming and cute\nappeals!\cOh, my goodness! What a perfectly\nadorable WATER SPORT appeal!
Oh, no… My sweet AZURILL was\ndistracted by another POKéMON.
My POKéMON has never won in a battle,\nbut put it in a CONTEST and look out!
My POKéMON's PETAL DANCE is a marvel\nof elegance.\cI won't let anyone disturb its\nperformance.
Everyone's POKéMON are very cute.\cHowever, if my POKéMON were to make\na cute appeal…\cI'm sure that it would be so much \ncuter than the others.
My child is in this CONTEST.
Come on, dear. Go for it!\nYour POKéMON is the best!
I think that girl over there is\nthe cutest of the lot.\cWhat's that? They're judging\nPOKéMON by their looks?
Ohh, seeing all these cute POKéMON,\nthey make we want to get my own!\cI'm going to go catch some!
BEAUTY CONTEST STAGE\nBE ALLURED BY BEAUTIFUL POKéMON!
CUTENESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE CHARMED BY CUTE POKéMON!
SMARTNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE IMPRESSED BY SMART POKéMON!
I wonder how many kinds of POKéMON\nthere are in the world.\cIt'd be great to cross seas and\ntrade POKéMON with people far away.
I've been hearing about some rotten\nscoundrels who steal POKéMON and rip\roff METEORITES.
Those rotten scoundrels who steal\nPOKéMON and rip off METEORITES…\cI haven't seen them around recently.
Oh, wow!\nIt's [PLAYER]!
I've heard the news!\nYou're really strong, aren't you?\cWe always argue about who is the\nstrongest of all TRAINERS here.\cSo when I heard about you, I decided\nto be your fan!\cI hope you'll keep on battling other\ntough TRAINERS.\cThat way, we'll be able to see more\nof your hot, hot battles.\cThat will make the others here see\nexactly how great you are.\cRemember, I'm cheering for you,\n[PLAYER]!
Yo, [PLAYER]!\nYou're the one we want to win!
The others, they don't know that\nyou're the best of the best!\cIsn't that right, [PLAYER]?\nShow them you've got guts!
I hate to say this, but the TRAINER\neverybody's talking about is\r[STR_VAR_1], no question about it!\cThat TRAINER's power…\nIt's out of the ordinary.
Darn it… I've been telling people\nthat [STR_VAR_1] is the best now…\cBut no one wants to listen…
I've been hearing things about\na tough new TRAINER.\cThis TRAINER's supposed to be beating\nGYM LEADERS, even.\cDo you know anything about this\nnew TRAINER?
Oh!\n[PLAYER]!\cGo for it!\nI'm pulling for you!
Sigh…\nBRAWLY…\cOh, no! Wait!\nThat's not right! No, no, no!\cI'm your fan through and through!\cSo make me proud!\nGo for it!
I can't help it, I can only get to\nlike BRAWLY…
Nobody understands the charm of\nBRAWLY…\cI don't care!\cEven if I'm the only one, I'm going\nto keep cheering for BRAWLY!
Whatever anyone says, my favorite\nTRAINER is DEWFORD's GYM LEADER\rBRAWLY!
You've surpassed your own father in\nevery regard!\cI'm telling you, so there's no question\nabout it at all!
Even when things turned bleak,\nyour father never gave up.\cThis I know to be true.\cYou never give up even if you lose!\nSo keep on battling!
NORMAN battled with more power,\ncharisma, and showmanship than you.\cEven though people may say that\nyou're strong…\cYou've still got a long way to go\ncompared to your father.
You're beginning to get the same\nair of awe NORMAN exudes.\cBut there's something conclusively\ndifferent between you and NORMAN.\cI can't tell you what that is.\nYou'll have to find it yourself.
Everyone here, we're all huge fans\nof POKéMON battles.\cWe discuss who we consider to be\nthe strongest of all TRAINERS.\cIf you were to become famous,\nwe might even become your fans!
Oh, woweee! It's [PLAYER]!\nFor real, too!\cPlease, shake my hand, shake my hand!
I'll always cheer for you, [PLAYER]!\nAlways, always!\cI don't want to see you lose ever,\n[PLAYER].\cBecause I know you're really,\nreally strong, [PLAYER]!
[STR_VAR_1] is really cool…\cEveryone thinks so, right, right?
[STR_VAR_1] really is cool, don't\nyou think so?\cEven if it's just me, I'm going to keep\ncheering my favorite TRAINER.
My favorite TRAINER is…\cCool…\cStrong…\cAnd really nice…\cI wish there was a TRAINER like that…
Whoa! It's [PLAYER]!\nWicked!\cWhen I grow up, I want to be strong\nlike you, [PLAYER]!
Even if I'm the only one…\cYou'll always be the only one\nI cheer for, [PLAYER]!\cBecause I believe in you, [PLAYER]!
[STR_VAR_1] is so wickedly cool…\nI want to shake hands with my hero.
Even if I'm the only one…\cI'm never going to stop being\n[STR_VAR_1]'s fan!\cBecause I've heard, [STR_VAR_1]\nnever loses!
[PLAYER]!\nYou are amazing after all!\cEver since I set eyes on you,\nI knew that you were great.\cIt looks like my eyes didn't deceive me.
Who cares about the others.\nI'm in your corner!\cYou don't need to worry. Just get\nout there and battle like always.
You're a pretty decent TRAINER,\nI think.\cBut I also think that [STR_VAR_1]\nis number one right now.\cThat's just my opinion.\nDon't worry about it too much.
Wow, you really are strong.\nMaybe even stronger than [STR_VAR_1].\cBut [STR_VAR_1] needs me.\cIf I don't cheer for [STR_VAR_1],\nwho will?
You've changed my mind!\nYou are strong, aren't you?\cI'd like you to tell me how you managed\nto get so strong!
The tougher the situation, the more\nattractively you battle.\cI can't wait for your next battle!
Among the recently hot TRAINERS,\n[STR_VAR_1] is the standout.\cThat toughness, it's simply not normal.\cYou're doing okay, but you're not in\nthe same class as [STR_VAR_1].
You are really popular…\cYou're strong, and you're caring to\nPOKéMON. No one can knock you.\cBut, you know, I believe in [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_1] is definitely stronger!\nI'm positive!
You…\cImpressive!
Your true worth, it is fine if only\nI recognized it.\cThe others I doubt will understand\nthe hidden power that beats within.
Yes, I see strength in your eyes.\cBut!\cYou still haven't realized your\npotential.
It is true that you are tremendously\npowerful.\cBut!\nI can tell…\cThat strength cannot be considered\ntrue strength yet!\cTrue strength is…!\n… …\cActually, I have no idea, either.
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\cI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present…
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET…\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
BATTLE FRONTIER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
Until they finish making the ferry,\nwe sailors have nothing to do…\cI wish they'd get a move on, the folks\nat the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT.
The ferry S.S. TIDAL is finally in\noperation.\cThe folks at the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT\nmust've worked extra hard.\cWell, it's my turn to get busy now!
Uh…\nOh, yes, I'm the MOVE DELETER.\cI can make POKéMON forget their moves.\cWould you like me to do that?
Which POKéMON should forget a move?
Which move should be forgotten?
[STR_VAR_1] knows only one move\nso it can't be forgotten…
Hm! [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2]?\nThat move should be forgotten?
It worked to perfection!\c[STR_VAR_1] has forgotten\n[STR_VAR_2] completely.
Come again if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
What?\nNo EGG should know any moves.
Hm!\cYour [STR_VAR_1] doesn't seem willing\nto forget SURF.
POKéMON are partners to people.\nThey aren't our tools.\cUnfortunately, there are some people\nwho fail to understand that…
KECLEON: Ruroro?
Huh? What? What's that?\cI'm not near awake yet…\nYou can have this…
Yawn…\cSleep is essential for good health…\nSleep and regain health…
Oh, my, my! Are you traveling alone?\nBut you're so young! Good for you!\cI'm sure my kids could learn a thing\nor two from you!\cMe? I'm a master of [POKEBLOCK]S.\cIf I get serious just a little, why,\nI can concoct great [POKEBLOCK]S.\cWould you like to learn from me,\na master of [POKEBLOCK]S?
Oh? Are you sure?\cYou shouldn't always try to do\neverything by yourself, dear!
Oh, good! You're a smart soul!\nThis is a bit long, so listen up!\cAre you ready?\cIf you look at [POKEBLOCK]S, you should see\nthat they are rated on how they feel.\cThe lower the feel rating,\nthe better it is. Don't forget this!\cA good [POKEBLOCK] has a low feel\nrating and a high level.\cA POKéMON can eat more good\n[POKEBLOCK]S than ordinary ones, too.\cAnd this is important.\cIf you want to make smooth [POKEBLOCK]S,\nuse different kinds of BERRIES.\cDon't be stingy--the kinds of BERRIES\naffect the smoothness of [POKEBLOCK]S.\cAnd another thing.\cThe more people blending BERRIES,\nthe smoother the [POKEBLOCK]S.\cThat's why you should talk to other\npeople and make [POKEBLOCK]S together.\cThat's about all you need to know to\nmake good [POKEBLOCK]S.\cIf everyone had POKéMON they love,\nsmooth [POKEBLOCK]S, and a loving family,\rthe world would be a happier place.\cDon't give up, dear!
When my wife gave birth to quadruplets,\nyou bet I was shocked.\cBut, now, seeing them play together,\nit makes me happy.
We're having MULTI BATTLES, but I know\nI'm going to win.
We like mixing stuff at\nthe RECORD CORNER.\cBut what gets mixed up?
We're going to make super [POKEBLOCK]S\nwith a BERRY BLENDER!
I want to brag about how tough my\nPOKéMON is, so we're going to enter\ra CONTEST together.
This planet's biggest mysteries are\nat the bottom of the sea.\cSomebody said that, but I don't know…
There's a deep underwater trench\nbetween MOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\cThat's what someone told me, anyway.
Welcome to LILYCOVE DEPARTMENT STORE.
Whenever I come to the DEPARTMENT\nSTORE, I always end up buying all sorts\rof things because it's so fun.
Today, my mom is going to buy me some\nnice furniture.
I'm buying something for my AZUMARILL\nas a reward for winning a CONTEST.
AZUMARILL: Maririroo!

Wireless Communication is a\nlot of fun, isn't it?\cI think it lets you do things that\nweren't possible before.\cFor instance, you can now trade\nwith people you couldn't before.\cI think it's going to be exciting!
I want to spread the word about how\nfun Wireless Communication can be.
Learn to use items properly.\nThat's basic, really.
My husband is waiting at home.\nWhat would make a good gift for him?
I'm leaving on a long journey soon.\nI need to stock up on items.
For quickly toughening up POKéMON,\nitems are the best.\cPROTEIN boosts ATTACK,\nand CALCIUM raises SP. ATK.
I want my POKéMON to have more\nendurance.\cI'm trying to decide whether to raise\nDEFENSE with IRON, or SP. DEF with ZINC.
I gave a CARBOS to my POKéMON,\nand its SPEED went up.
Hmm…\cAn attacking move…\nOr a defensive move…\cIt's no easy matter to decide which TM\nmoves should be taught to POKéMON…
There are so many different kinds of\nTM moves.\cA catalog I read said there are fifty\ndifferent kinds.
I'd like to get all the different TMs,\nbut a POKéMON learns only four moves.
This place is full of cute DOLLS.\cI should buy some for me, instead of\njust for my children.
I'm not big enough to raise POKéMON,\nso I'm getting a cute DOLL instead.
They sell many cute MATS here.\cI wonder which one I should get?\nMaybe I'll buy them all…
I think they closed the rooftop\nbecause the weather is wild today.
Don't they have set dates for their\nclear-out sales?\cI watch TV, but they never show any\ncommercials.
Yes! I've been waiting a long time for\nthis clear-out sale.\cThey have items that you can only get\nhere. I'm going to load up, that I am!
Ohh… I'm bone-dry thirsty!
It's a VENDING MACHINE.\nWhich drink would you like?
Clang!\cA can of [STR_VAR_1] dropped down.
Clang!\cScore! An extra can of [STR_VAR_1]\ndropped down!
Not enough money…
Decided against buying a drink.
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-bound\n[PLAYER]?\cThe GYM LEADERS here use\nPSYCHIC-type POKéMON.\cIf you go up against them with\nFIGHTING- or POISON-type POKéMON,\rthey'll inflict horrible damage!\cPlus, they'll come at you with\noutstanding combination attacks.\cIf you want to win, you'll need to show\nthem how tight you are with your\rPOKéMON. Go for it!
Wow, you're astounding!\nYou're one great TRAINER!
Battles hinge on the strength of your\nspirit! The weak-spirited will never win!
I lost!\nI must temper my spirit again!
The indecisive lose.\nThat's my warning to you.
Let me see your talent!
You possess spectacular talent!
If there are prodigies in the world,\nthen our GYM LEADERS are them!\cHowever, you may be even more talented\nthan them…
Fufufufu… Watch me levitate a POKé\nBALL telekinetically!\cWrooooooooaaaar!\n… … … … … … …\cSometimes, I'm out of sync…
My POKéMON battling skills are out\nof sync, too!
A POKé BALL was too heavy to lift\npsychically. But this dust bunny…\cWhoooooooooooooooh!\n… … … … … …\cNo, I'm not cheating!\nI didn't blow on it! Honestly!
When you lose to me, don't be too hard\non yourself.\cIt's not that you're weak--I'm just\ntoo strong!
You're just too strong!
I'm not going to get down on myself for\nlosing. I just need to train harder.\cPositive thinking--that's my strong\npoint!
I see it…\nI see your future…\cIf you can beat me, I will tell you\nyour future!
I surrender!
You will wage a terrifically intense\nbattle with our GYM LEADERS…\cThe result…\nYou won't hear it from me!
The roads you have traveled…\nWhat you have experienced…\cCome at me with everything you've\nlearned!
You've traveled a path of greatness!
A bright future awaits those who have\nworked diligently.\cFor those who lazed idly, there is\nonly despair at the end.\cWhat goes around comes around…
Even at the risk of life, I will win\nthis battle!
What you do…\nIt horrifies me…
How dare you beat me…\cIt won't be my fault if something\nhorrible befalls you…
Hohoho.\cYou need me to show you how tenacious\nthe PSYCHIC type can be.
Oh! My, my!\nYour battle style is fantastic!
I… I don't let defeat rattle m-me,\nhowever b-badly.
Let me show you a perfectly awful,\nhorrifying time!
N-nooooo!
Your vitality is contagious!\nGet away from me quickly!
I may be past my prime, but I suggest\nyou not patronize me.
Ah, you overflow with the power\nof youth!
It seems that I could not overcome\nyour youthful energy.
You're not getting through to the end!\nNot if I can help it!
How could you be so ludicrously\nstrong?
Humph! You may be strong, but you're\nnot suitable for the PSYCHIC type!\cThe way you battle is somehow brutal!
Wroooar! Have a taste of my super\nPOKéMON hard-battling power!
Oh!\nDone in!
All right! I think I'll develop a special\ninvincible POKéMON power next.

TATE: What?! Our combination…\nLIZA: Was shattered!\cTATE: It can't be helped. You've won…\nLIZA: So, in recognition, take this.
[PLAYER] received the MIND BADGE\nfrom TATE and LIZA.
TATE: The MIND BADGE enhances the\nSP. ATK and SP. DEF of POKéMON.\cLIZA: It also lets you use the HM move\nDIVE outside of battle.\cTATE: You should also take this, too.
TATE: That TM04 contains…\nLIZA: CALM MIND!\cTATE: It raises SP. ATK and…\nLIZA: It raises SP. DEF!\cTATE: It's a move that's perfect…\nLIZA: For PSYCHIC POKéMON!\c… … … … … …

TATE: Looks like the bond between you\nand your POKéMON is far stronger than\rthe bond that we share as twins.\cLIZA: You will become even stronger!\nWe've battled you, so we know.
TATE: Hehehe… Were you surprised?\cLIZA: That there are two GYM LEADERS?\cTATE: Oops, you have only one…\nLIZA: POKéMON that can battle.\cTATE: We can't battle that way!\cLIZA: If you want to challenge us,\nbring some more POKéMON.

Hmm!\nYour [STR_VAR_1]…
It likes [STR_VAR_1]S,\ndoesn't it?\cNo, I'm positive of it! It definitely\nlikes [STR_VAR_1]S!
It doesn't appear to like or dislike\nany [POKEBLOCK]S.
My husband can tell what kind of\n[POKEBLOCK]S a POKéMON likes at a glance.
My little sister exchanges MAIL with\nher boyfriend in FORTREE.\cI don't envy her one bit at all.
Even though I can't see my friend in\nFORTREE, my POKéMON carries MAIL\rback and forth for us.\cI'm not lonesome, even though we're\napart.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The GYM LEADERS in this town are\na formidable duo.\cTheir combination attacks are, like,\nexcellent and wow!
Depending on the special abilities of\nPOKéMON, some moves might change\ror not work at all.
If I win a whole lot of link battles\nand show everyone how good I am,\rI might get a fan following!
REVIVE is fantastic!\cGive it to a fainted POKéMON,\nand the POKéMON will arise.\cBut be careful, REVIVE doesn't restore\nthe used-up PP of moves.
MAX REPEL keeps all weak POKéMON away.\cOut of all the REPEL sprays, it lasts\nthe longest.
The NET and DIVE BALLS are rare POKé\nBALLS that are only made in MOSSDEEP.\cA NET BALL is effective against\nBUG-type and WATER-type POKéMON.\cA DIVE BALL works best on POKéMON\nat the bottom of the sea.
Hey there, TRAINER!\nA SUPER ROD really is super!\cSay all you want, but this baby can\ncatch POKéMON off the seafloor!\cWhat do you think?\nYou want it, don't you?
You bet, you bet!\nAfter all, a SUPER ROD is really super!
If there's any water, try dropping in\nyour ROD and see what bites!
Hunh?\nDon't you like to fish?
Go after the seafloor POKéMON with\nyour SUPER ROD.
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN]…\cAs you can see, there's not much here,\nbut this is my home.\cThank you for all that you've done.\cThis is my token of appreciation.\nIt's the HIDDEN MACHINE DIVE.\cNo need to be shy--you've earned\nthis HM.
STEVEN: While you're using SURF, you\nshould notice dark patches of water.\cUse DIVE if you come to deep water\nlike it. You'll drop to the seafloor.\cWhen you want to come back up, use\nDIVE again.\cIn some places, it won't be possible\nfor you to surface, though.
STEVEN: Apparently, there's an\nunderwater cavern between\rMOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\cYou know, the one that CAPT. STERN\nfound in his submarine.
[PLAYER] checked the POKé BALL.\cIt contained the POKéMON\nBELDUM.\cTake the POKé BALL?
[PLAYER] obtained a BELDUM.
There is no space for another POKéMON.
[PLAYER] left the POKé BALL where\nit was.
It's a letter.\c… … … … … …\cTo [PLAYER][KUN]…\cI've decided to do a little soul-\nsearching and train on the road.\cI don't plan to return home for some\ntime.\cI have a favor to ask of you.\cI want you to take the POKé BALL on\nthe desk.\cInside it is a BELDUM, my favorite\nPOKéMON.\cI'm counting on you.\cMay our paths cross someday.\cSTEVEN STONE

My little brother says he likes to go\nfind people's SECRET BASES.
My little brother says he likes to\nvisit people's SECRET BASES and have\rPOKéMON battles.
Was it you who made a SECRET BASE\nnear [STR_VAR_1]?
You should make a SECRET BASE\nsomewhere. I'll go find it!
SKITTY: Miyaan?
The rocket's launch is imminent!
The rocket launched safely!\nThat's successful launch no. [STR_VAR_1]!
I know that things are a little\nhaywire right now, but…\cThe rocket's launch is imminent!
I know that things are a little\nhaywire right now, but…\cThe rocket launched safely!\nThat's successful launch no. [STR_VAR_1]!
A rocket launch demands perfection.\nNot even a 1% margin of error is allowed.\cEven if it's 99% okay, the whole thing\nis useless if 1% happens to be no good.\cDespite that, we never stop trying.\nWhy? It's a dream that never ends.
Those MAGMA thugs have their sights\nset on our SPACE CENTER.\cBut we can't allow anything that minor\nto interfere with our rocket launch!
I was taking a stroll down the beach\nwhen I found this.\cIt's not anything I need, so you can\nhave it.
The HOENN region has been famous for \nits meteor showers for a long time.
TEAM MAGMA can't be allowed to steal\nthe rocket fuel.\cOh, by the way, you can have this stone\nI found on the beach.
With TEAM MAGMA around, I guess\nstrolls on the beach aren't safe.
Some people claim that POKéMON came\nfrom space. Could it be true?
TEAM AQUA should take care of\nTEAM MAGMA!\cBut if they did that, TEAM AQUA will\nbecome bold and brazen, won't they?
A giant chunk of metal bursts through\nthe skies and flies into space…\cIt boggles my mind!
A giant chunk of metal bursts through\nthe skies and flies into space…\cBut TEAM MAGMA wants to spoil\nthat dream of mine!\cI'm not having any of that!
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN], have you read that\nproclamation already?\cTEAM MAGMA is coming after the rocket\nfuel on this island.\cI don't know what they'd need it for,\nbut they can't be allowed to take it.\cI'll keep an eye on things for\na while longer.\cIn the meantime, why don't you go\ncheck out the town?
As promised, we've come for\nthe rocket fuel!
Ran out of fuel…
Don't think you're on a roll just\nbecause you've beaten me!
We gave you fair warning!\nThere's nothing sneaky about us!
Grrr…\nWe should've used sneaky treachery…
Okay, I get it already! The next time,\nwe'll come unannounced.
The rocket fuel the SPACE CENTER has\nin storage--that's what we're after.\cWe mean to take every last bit of it!
Please, can you spare some fuel?\nEven a chintzy cup will do!
What are we going to do with\nthe rocket fuel?\cHow would I know?\nAsk our leader upstairs!
Our leader said no one, but no one,\ngets past me!
Ack! Ack! Aaack!
Please, tell our leader that\nI never abandoned my post.\rThat I stayed to the bitter end…
This is…\nAn intent-to-steal notice?\c“To the staff of the SPACE CENTER:\nHow are you? We are doing fine.\c“We will soon visit you to take your\nrocket fuel.\c“Please don't try to stop us.\nWe will take the fuel no matter what.\c“Let there be more land!\n                                          TEAM MAGMA”
MOSSDEEP has mainly sunny weather,\nand its winds are stable.\cIt's an ideal location for launching\nrockets.
Why would TEAM MAGMA want to steal\nour rocket fuel in the first place?
If only I was a little younger, I would\nhave liked being an astronaut…\cNo… It's not too late!\nI can and will try!
If TEAM MAGMA takes the rocket fuel,\nI won't be able to go to space!\cThey can't be allowed to get away\nwith such an outrage!
I wish ordinary people could go into\nspace one day…
TEAM MAGMA…\nDo they want to go to space, too?
What's wrong with you?\cYou're outnumbered three to one,\nbut you still want to take us on?
Good answer!\nThat's what a smart person'll do!
A reckless go-getter, are you?\nOkay, I'll go first!
I lost!\nBut!
It's too soon to be relieved!\nI'm up next!
I lost, too!\nBut!
I bet you want to take a break.\nBut I'm not about to let you do that!
We should've taken a break…\nThat's what we should've done…
Three of us here, and look at the sorry\nmess we got ourselves into.
We three losing like this…\nWe look worse than usual by triple!
Are we being useful to our leader\nat all?
Hehehe!\cWe come all the way here to get some\nfuel, and we're interfered with again!\cIf you're going to mess with us too,\nwe'll take care of you at the same time!
MAXIE: Clear out of the way!\nDon't you dare interfere!
STEVEN: TEAM MAGMA…\cWhat's the point of stealing rocket\nfuel?
MAXIE: Fufufu… Since you're so\ncurious, you deserve an explanation.\cWe're going to jettison the entire\nload into MT. CHIMNEY!\cWith GROUDON gone, we have no need\nfor that slag heap of a mountain!\cSo we'll use the fuel's power to make\nthe volcano erupt!\cIt will be savage!
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou're going to help me?\cLet's go into battle together!\nAre you ready?
STEVEN: Then, hurry!\nGet ready quickly!
All I want…\nI just want to expand the land mass…
I'm with our leader…
MAXIE: We failed to make the volcano\nerupt…\cWe failed to control GROUDON after\nwe had awoken it…\cIs our goal to expand the land\nmisguided?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cIf…\nIf we, TEAM MAGMA, are wrong…\r… … … … … …\cThen might TEAM AQUA's goal to expand\nthe sea also be equally misguided?
MAXIE: All right…\nWe will give up on the fuel…\cThere appear to be more important\nmatters that I must examine…
STEVEN: Whew, that was too tense.\n[PLAYER][KUN], thank you.\cI have something to give you as\nthanks for your support.\cPlease come see me at home\nafter this.\cOh, yes, I don't live in RUSTBORO CITY.\nI live right here on this island.
When I was young, I traveled the world\nas a POKéMON TRAINER.\cNow that I've become an old buzzard,\nmy only amusement is watching young\rTRAINERS battle.
The door appears to be locked.
A TRAINER named [STR_VAR_1] is\nvisiting my home.\cWould you like to challenge\n[STR_VAR_1]?
You won't battle? I'm disappointed\nthat I can't see you battle…
Oh, good, good!\cBut my house isn't all that sturdy.\cCould I ask you to keep it down to\na 3-on-3 match?
Before you two battle, you should\nsave your progress.
I hope to see a good match!
So, it became a standoff.\cIt was a brilliant match in which\nneither side conceded a step!
That was superlative!\cWhy, it was like seeing myself in\nmy youth again!
Ah, too bad for you!\cBut it was a good match.\nI hope you can win next time.
Yo! How's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound [PLAYER]?\cSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER JUAN is\na master of WATER-type POKéMON.\cAnd, to get to JUAN, an icy floor\nwill hamper your progress…\cListen, I'm sorry, but that's all the\nadvice that I have for you.\cThe rest of the way, you have to\ngo for it yourself!
Yow! You've beaten even JUAN, who\nwas supposedly the best in all HOENN!\cOkay! Check out your TRAINER CARD.\cIf you've gotten all the BADGES, you're\nset for the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge!
Let me ask you.\nDid you know?\rAh, I should not be so coy.\cIt was I who taught WALLACE everything\nthere is to know about POKéMON.\cOnce, I had given up my position as\nthe GYM LEADER.\cIn my place, I had entrusted WALLACE\nwith the GYM.\cHowever, a compelling reason arose for\nme to make a comeback.\cAh, but enough chatter.\nLet us begin our match, shall we?\cPlease, you shall bear witness to\nour artistry.\cA grand illusion of water sculpted\nby POKéMON and myself!
Ahahaha, excellent!\nVery well, you are the winner.\cFrom you, I sense the brilliant shine\nof skill that will overcome all.\cHowever, compared with me or even\nWALLACE, you are lacking in elegance.\cPerhaps I should make you a loan\nof my outfit?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cHahaha, I merely jest!\cRather than my clothes, I shall reward\nyou with this, the RAIN BADGE!
[PLAYER] received the RAIN BADGE\nfrom JUAN.
Having the RAIN BADGE shall assure you\nthe full obedience of all your POKéMON\rto your every command.\cThe RAIN BADGE also allows the use\nof the HM move WATERFALL to scale\rwalls of cascading water.\cAnd, so that you never forget the\nbattle we shared, take this…
The TECHNICAL MACHINE I handed you\ncontains WATER PULSE.\cIn use, it will occasionally confuse\nthe target with ultrasonic waves.\c… … … … … …
Registered GYM LEADER JUAN\nin the POKéNAV.
The TRAINERS who have gathered all\nthe GYM BADGES of HOENN should make\rway to the ultimate destination.\cThe POKéMON LEAGUE.\cTravel to the easternmost reaches\nof HOENN, to the island EVER GRANDE.\cThere, you shall find the POKéMON\nLEAGUE.
There remains but one BADGE to\nobtain in HOENN.\cIf you wish to challenge the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you must obtain the last\rBADGE from the GYM in FORTREE.

JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its\nusual state of serenity…\cBut our young typhoon has returned\nto put us to the test again!\cWell, my friend, most certainly!\cI shall be delighted to dance with you\nas often as you wish!
Ahahaha, you are the winner!\nYou have defeated me again!
JUAN: If I told you to become my\napprentice, you will refuse, I am sure.\cI would like to make a gift of my coat\nto you.\cBut again, you will refuse.\nI imagine that to be so.\cAnd that, my friend, is a certain sign\nof nobility!
JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its\nusual state of serenity…\cBut our young typhoon has returned\nto put us to the test again!\cWell, my friend, most certainly!\nI shall be delighted to dance with you…\cAh, no, no, no.\nYou have with you but one POKéMON.\cI wish that you would return with\ntwo, perhaps more, POKéMON, please.
I'll show you the sublime techniques\nI learned from our LEADER JUAN!
Please forgive me, JUAN…
Watch what happens if you crack all\nthe floor tiles.
You came all the way here, but you won't\nget to see JUAN.\cNot if you lose to me, you won't!
You're strong!\nI was fooled by your cute looks!
You might be good enough to avoid\nbeing wiped out in one hit by JUAN.
The sight of JUAN conducting\na battle…\cThe very beauty of it compelled me to\nbecome a TRAINER.
You battled with more beauty than\nI could muster…
The grace you bring to battle is\nfabulous.\cOh… I'm so fortunate to have found\nPOKéMON.
I should teach you how harsh battles\ncan be.
Oh.\nYou're strong.
I'll tell you something good.\cIf you want to reach JUAN, you\nneed to walk on each floor tile once.
The POKéMON GYM of the highest level\nin the HOENN region…\cThat's the SOOTOPOLIS GYM.
What a high level you are!
Rather than being satisfied by being\nin a strong GYM, I imagine training in\rother places will make you stronger.\rBut above all, it looks more fun.
I train my POKéMON together with\nJUAN.\cDon't think I'm a pushover.
I was beaten…
I think you have potential.\nWhy don't you stay and train with us?
A graceful glide across the ice while\ncrossing no lines…\cA TRAINER putting on that performance\nwould be elegantly beautiful!
Well, excuse me?!
This is really obvious, but how strong\nyou are as a TRAINER has nothing to do\rwith how young or old you are.
When I'm with my POKéMON, the time\nflies by before you can say, “Oops!”
Oops!
I wish I could forget about lost causes\nbefore I can manage an “Oops!”
I can battle with really rare POKéMON\nif you'd like.
Oh, there now! Did you have a good look\nat my POKéMON?
I came to this GYM because JUAN\npraised me for my darling POKéMON.\cOh, if only I'd met JUAN years ago\nwhen I was younger…
Giggle…\nYour grim look is so charming.
Oh, dear.\nI went much too easy on you.
You couldn't lay a finger on JUAN,\nI'm sure. Giggle…
WALLACE is rumored to be the toughest\nTRAINER in the whole HOENN region.\cThis town's GYM is led by the TRAINER\nwho taught WALLACE.\cBut the ELITE FOUR… They're said to be\neven stronger than WALLACE's mentor.\cHow strong could they be?
Everyone in town has taken refuge\nand won't come out of their homes.\cEven I would rather not venture\noutside.
Whenever, wherever, and whatever\nhappens, I will always be friends with\rPOKéMON.\cBecause it's fun to be with POKéMON!
Aren't POKéMON our friends?\cWhy are they going wild this way?
PP UP is great!\cIt raises the POWER POINTS, the PP,\nof a POKéMON move.
What…\nWhat is happening?\cI really want to know, but it's too\nscary to go outside.
Do you know FULL RESTORE?\cFull restoration of HP!\nEradication of all status problems!\cIt's truly an item of your dreams!
This weather…\nDid something awaken?
For thirty years I've remained in\nSOOTOPOLIS honing my skills.\cI developed a shattering TM.\nI bequeath it to you!
TM31 contains BRICK BREAK! It's a move\nso horrible that I can't describe it.
KECLEON: Puu puhyaah.
MT. PYRE…\cAt its peak are two orbs placed side\nby side. Did you know?
Yes, two orbs side by side…\cThe sight of them together…\nIt is somehow soothing…
Is that so?\nPerhaps you ought to visit and see…
You're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\cSOOTOPOLIS's JUAN has many fans.\nEven more than his student WALLACE!\cDo you have any?
Oh, then you must be pretty strong.
Oh, dear…\nThat's a little lonesome.\cTry working a little harder to get\na fan following.
Dedicated fans come over from even\noutside of HOENN.\cIt was really wild when I went to the\nTRAINER FAN CLUB in LILYCOVE.
Listen up, and I'll tell you something\ngood.\cThere's supposed to be an ancient\nruin in the sea around here.\cThere could be treasures just waiting\nto be discovered down there.
Ancient treasures…\cIt would be nice if they existed, but\neven if they didn't, it would be so\rbeautiful to take an underwater\rstroll with my POKéMON.
AZUMARILL: Marurii.
There appears to be some connection\nbetween SOOTOPOLIS and MT. PYRE.\cMy friends and I did some research on\nit at the lab where I used to work.
My big brother used to study the sea.
Hello! You're our first guest in\na good while.\cYou've brightened up my day, so I'll\ngive you a big WAILMER DOLL.
Take good care of it!
Oh, you want it, but not right now?\nOkay, then I'll hold it for you.
Are you sure?\nYou don't want this DOLL?
I love plush DOLLS!
An underwater volcano erupted and\nforced itself up from the depths.\cIts crater emerged from the sea and\nbecame filled with rainwater.\cThat's how SOOTOPOLIS CITY came into\nbeing.
The cave that links SOOTOPOLIS and\nthe outside world…\cIt seems as if the cave was made to\nkeep something from getting out.\cOr am I just imagining things?
Do you know the POKéMON SEEDOT?\nIt's hardly ever seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\cAnyway, I love big SEEDOT.\nThe bigger the better.\cBut my younger brother, he says that\nLOTAD is bigger.\cThat's silly.\nSEEDOT has to be bigger than that!\cHuh? Do you have a SEEDOT with you?\nP-p-please, show me!
[STR_VAR_2] inches!\nOh, my gosh, this is a big one!\cIt might even beat the big LOTAD\nmy younger brother saw!\cThanks for showing me.\nThis is my thanks!
[PLAYER] received a POTION.
Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.
[STR_VAR_2] inches, is it?\cHmm… I've seen a bigger SEEDOT\nthan this one.
Oh, now this is quite something…\nBut it's not a SEEDOT!
You don't have a big SEEDOT?\nThat's too bad…\cIf you get a big SEEDOT, please\ncome show me.
The biggest SEEDOT in history!\n[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]-inch giant!\cA SEEDOT bigger than a LOTAD\nalways wanted!
Do you know the POKéMON LOTAD?\nIt's rarely seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\cI love, I mean love, big LOTAD!\cMy big brother says that SEEDOT is\nbigger.\cBut that's wrong! Everyone knows that\nLOTAD is a lot bigger.\cHunh? Do you have a LOTAD?\nP-p-please show me!
[STR_VAR_2] inches!\nWow, that is big!\cIt might be even bigger than the huge\nSEEDOT my big brother saw.\cThanks for showing me!\nThis is my thanks!

Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.
[STR_VAR_2] inches?\cHmm… I've seen a bigger LOTAD\nthan this one here.
Well, isn't this something!\nBut it's no LOTAD!
Don't you have a big LOTAD?\nHow disappointing…\cIf you get a big LOTAD, please\ncome show me!
The biggest LOTAD in history!\n[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]-inch colossus!\cA LOTAD bigger than a SEEDOT\nalways wanted!
When I was young, I traveled the world\nas a POKéMON TRAINER.\cNow that I've become an old buzzard,\nmy only amusement is watching young\rTRAINERS battle.
The door appears to be locked.
A TRAINER named [STR_VAR_1]\nis visiting my home.\cWould you like to challenge\n[STR_VAR_1]?
You won't battle? I'm disappointed\nthat I can't see you battle…
Oh, good, good!\cBut my house isn't all that sturdy.\cCould I ask you to keep it down to\na 3-on-3 match?
Before you two battle, you should\nsave your progress.
I hope to see a good match!
[STR_VAR_1]
The match ended up a draw.
So, it became a standoff.\cIt was a brilliant match in which\nneither side conceded a step!
[STR_VAR_1]
That was superlative!\cWhy, it was like seeing myself in\nmy youth again!
[STR_VAR_1]
Ah, too bad for you!\cBut it was a good match.\nI hope you can win next time.
Welcome, challenger!\nI'm SIDNEY of the ELITE FOUR.\cI like that look you're giving me.\nI guess you'll give me a good match.\rThat's good! Looking real good!\cAll right! You and me, let's enjoy\na battle that can only be staged\rhere in the POKéMON LEAGUE!
Well, how do you like that? I lost!\nEh, it was fun, so it doesn't matter.
Well, listen to what this loser has\nto say.\cYou've got what it takes to go far.\nNow, go on to the next room and enjoy\ryour next battle!
Ahahaha!\cI'm PHOEBE of the ELITE FOUR.\nI did my training on MT. PYRE.\cWhile I trained, I gained the ability\nto commune with GHOST-type POKéMON.\cYes, the bond I developed with POKéMON\nis extremely tight.\cSo, come on, just try and see if you can\neven inflict damage on my POKéMON!
Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.
There's a definite bond between you\nand your POKéMON, too.\cI didn't recognize it, so it's only\nnatural that I lost.\cYup, I'd like to see how far your bond\nwill carry you.\cGo ahead, move on to the next room.
Welcome, my name is GLACIA\nof the ELITE FOUR.\cI've traveled from afar to HOENN\nso that I may hone my ice skills.\cBut all I have seen are challenges by\nweak TRAINERS and their POKéMON.\cWhat about you?\cIt would please me to no end if I could\ngo all out against you!
You and your POKéMON…\nHow hot your spirits burn!\cThe all-consuming heat overwhelms.\cIt's no surprise that my icy skills\nfailed to harm you.
Advance to the next room.\cAnd there, confirm the truly fearsome\nside of the POKéMON LEAGUE.
I am the last of the POKéMON LEAGUE\nELITE FOUR, DRAKE the DRAGON master!\cIn their natural state, POKéMON are\nwild living things. They are free.\cAt times, they hinder us.\nAt times, they help us.\cFor us to battle with POKéMON as\npartners, do you know what it takes?\cDo you know what is needed?\cIf you don't, then you will never\nprevail over me!
Superb, it should be said.
You deserve every credit for coming\nthis far as a TRAINER of POKéMON.\cYou do seem to know what is needed.\cYes, what a TRAINER needs is a\nvirtuous heart.\cPOKéMON touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and learn good from wrong.\cThey touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and grow strong.\cGo! Go onwards!\nThe CHAMPION is waiting!
WALLACE: Welcome, [PLAYER][KUN].\cThat incident in SOOTOPOLIS CITY…\nThat was superb work, putting an end\rto that crisis all by yourself.\cOops!\cIt wouldn't be fair to say that you\nalone ended the crisis.\cYou overcame that difficult situation\nby working as one with your POKéMON.\cWe TRAINERS raise POKéMON by giving\nthem items and by teaching them new\rtechniques for battle.\cBut we ourselves also learn many\nthings from POKéMON.\cAnd this is where your achievements\nare put to the test against what\rothers like you have achieved.\cNow!\cWho can most elegantly dance with\ntheir POKéMON in HOENN?\cShow me right here and now!
I, the CHAMPION, fall in defeat…\cThat was wonderful work.\nYou were elegant, infuriatingly so.\rAnd yet it was utterly glorious!\cKudos to you, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou are a truly noble POKéMON\nTRAINER!
WALLACE: The POKéMON you sent into\nbattle…\cAt times they danced like a spring\nbreeze, and at times they struck\rlike lightning.\cIt was with light, yet surefooted,\nelegance that you led your POKéMON.\cEven I felt bedazzled by your\nmasterful performance!\cYou now stand at the glorious peak\nof the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cI now proclaim you to be the new\nHOENN region…
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHere's some advice before you challenge\nthe CHAMPION…
MAY: Huh?\nWhat, what, what?\c[PLAYER][KUN]…\nCould it be that…\rIt's already over?
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]!\cHow would you like some advice before\nyou challenge the CHAMPION?…
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]…\cAre you trying to tell me…\nYou've beaten the CHAMPION?
PROF. BIRCH: See?\nWhat did I tell you, [RIVAL]?\cDidn't I tell you that you don't need\nto worry about [PLAYER][KUN]?\c… … … … … … … …\n[PLAYER][KUN], you've finally done it.\cWhen I heard that you defeated your\nown father at the PETALBURG GYM,\rI thought perhaps you had a chance…\cBut to think you've actually become\nthe CHAMPION!\cAh, yes!\cWhat became of your POKéDEX?\nHere, let me see.
PROF. BIRCH: Anyways,\ncongratulations!\cNow, go proudly into the final room!
WALLACE: [PLAYER][KUN]…\cNo, let me rephrase that properly.\cThe new CHAMPION!\cCome with me.
WALLACE: I'm sorry, but…\cFrom here on, only those TRAINERS who\nhave become CHAMPIONS may enter.\cYou'll have to wait outside with\nPROF. BIRCH.
MAY: Groan…\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cI'm just joking! That's okay!\nThat's the rule!\c[PLAYER][KUN]!\nHonestly, congratulations!
BRENDAN: Whaaaat?! … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cIt can't be helped if that's the rule.\c[PLAYER], way to go!\nCongratulations!
Beyond this point, only those TRAINERS\nwho have collected all the GYM BADGES\rare permitted to enter.\cTRAINER, let us confirm that you have\nall the GYM BADGES.
You haven't obtained all the BADGES.\cIf you're bound for the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you must return with them.
TRAINER! Believe in yourself and your\nPOKéMON, and go forth!
WALLACE: This room…\cThis is where we keep records of\nPOKéMON that prevailed through\rharsh battles.\cIt is here that the LEAGUE CHAMPIONS\nare honored.
WALLACE: Come on, let's record your\nname as a TRAINER who triumphed over\rthe POKéMON LEAGUE, and the names of\rthe partners who battled with you.
The POKéMON LEAGUE is only a short\ndistance after the VICTORY ROAD.\cIf you've come this far, what choice\ndo you have but to keep going?
The long and harrowing VICTORY ROAD…\cIt's like reliving the path one has\ntraveled in life…\cBelieve in your POKéMON and give it\nyour very best!
SCOTT: [PLAYER][KUN], you've clawed your\nway up to face the POKéMON LEAGUE!\cI'm happy for you!\nYou made my cheering worthwhile!\c[PLAYER][KUN], if you were to become\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION…\cI'll get in touch with you then.\cOkay, [PLAYER][KUN].\nGo for greatness!
MR. BRINEY: Hold on, lass!\nWait up, PEEKO!
Hm? You're [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou saved my darling PEEKO!\rWe owe so much to you!\cWhat's that?\nYou want to sail with me?\cHmhm…\cYou have a LETTER bound for DEWFORD\nand a package for SLATEPORT, then?\cQuite the busy life you must lead!\cBut, certainly, what you're asking is\nno problem at all.\cYou've come to the right man!\nWe'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: DEWFORD it is, then!\cAnchors aweigh!\nPEEKO, we're setting sail, my darling!
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?\nYour deliveries can wait?\cYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail!
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nI know exactly what you want to say!\cYou're to deliver a LETTER to DEWFORD\nand a package to SLATEPORT.\cWhat you need me to do is no problem\nat all--I'm the man for the job!\cFirst, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nI know exactly what you want to say!\cYou're to deliver a package to\nCAPT. STERN in SLATEPORT.\cWhat you need me to do is no problem\nat all--I'm the man for the job!\cFirst, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!\nFor you, I'll go out to sea anytime!\cNow, my friend, where are we bound?
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?\nWell, PEEKO owes her life to you.\cYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail!
PEEKO: Pii piihyoro!
You're the first TRAINER I've seen who\ndeploys POKéMON so masterfully.\cBut, I should tell you--my son is\nstronger than you.\cHe even took the POKéMON LEAGUE\nchallenge, I'll have you know.
We use this MACHO BRACE to more\neffectively strengthen our POKéMON\rin training.\cSince you've beaten all of us here,\nI don't know if you need it, but we\rwould like you to have our MACHO BRACE.
When it comes to POKéMON battles,\nwe tend to be pretty passionate.
Mommy is stronger than Daddy.\cI'm stronger than Mommy.\cAnd Grandma's stronger than me!\cBut my big brother is even stronger\nthan Grandma.
There's no question that you're strong.\cBut if you were to battle my grandson,\nyou'd end up crying in frustration.\cHe's much stronger than any TRAINER\nour family knows.\cHe must be challenging the POKéMON\nLEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\cKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!
My grandson must be challenging the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\cKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!
Oh, dear, dear.\nAren't your POKéMON exhausted?\cIf you'd like, rest up here.\nThat's a fine idea! You should do that.
That's right.\nTake your time and rest up!
Oh, dear, dear.\nAre your POKéMON still tired?\cYou should take another rest here.\nThat's a fine idea. You should do that.
Is that so?\nYou don't need to be shy about it.
The CABLE CAR is ready to go up.\nWould you like to be on it?
Please step this way.
Please ride with us another time.
The CABLE CAR is ready to go down.\nWould you like to be on it?

My big brother's the FOSSIL MANIAC…\nHe's a nice guy who loves FOSSILS…\cHe loves digging holes, too…\nHe dug this hole by himself…\cYou can have this, so you can DIG\nholes just like my big brother…
If you make a POKéMON DIG inside a\ncave, you're returned to the entrance…
Rocks in peculiar shapes fill\nthe display case…
THE COMPOSITION OF STRATA…\nHOW RAIN SHAPES THE LAND…\rSTONES, SOIL, AND ROCK…\cIt's crammed with books.
I'm the FOSSIL MANIAC…\nI'm a nice guy who loves FOSSILS…\cDo you want a FOSSIL?\cBut the FOSSILS around these parts all\nbelong to me… None for you…\cIf you can't bear to go without\na FOSSIL, look in a desert where there\rare boulders and sand that may hide\rFOSSILS…
You found a FOSSIL, didn't you?\nThat's so nice… It's so dreamy…\cWhat are you going to do with that\nFOSSIL?\cFrom what I've heard, DEVON is doing\nresearch on reviving POKéMON from\rFOSSILS…\cI love my FOSSILS, so I would never\ndo anything like that…
FOSSILS are so… Wonderful…\nIt's so dreamy…
Oh…\nIt's not safe that way…\cI was digging away, you see…\nWhen the whole wall collapsed…\cI think there's a giant cavern\nunderneath now…\cBut I've left it alone because I don't\nthink there are any FOSSILS there…
LANETTE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI'm sorry everything is so cluttered…\nWhen I get engrossed in research,\rthings end up this way…\cThis is embarrassing… Please keep\nthis a secret in exchange for this.
May I offer advice about my POKéMON\nStorage System?\cYou should organize your BOXES so you\ncan tell which POKéMON are in them.
It's LANETTE's research notes.\nThere's information about BOXES.\cDesign BOXES to hold 30 POKéMON each.\cEach TRAINER should be able to store\n420 POKéMON on the PC system.\cKeep reading?
A marking system should be added to\nmake POKéMON easier to organize.\cThe name and wallpaper design of each\nBOX will be made changeable to please\rthe stored POKéMON.\cKeep reading?
When storing a POKéMON, it should be\nsent to the BOX inspected last.\cIf that BOX is full, the received\nPOKéMON is stored in the next BOX.\cIn other words, when a BOX is examined,\nit is automatically selected as the BOX\rto which POKéMON are sent.
[PLAYER] closed the notebook.
There's an e-mail from someone on\nthe PC.\c“… … … … … … …\c“Your Storage System offers more\nconvenience than mine.\c“It has a lot of user-friendly features\nthat make it fun and useful, too.\c“It makes me proud that I played\na part in its development.\c“Here's hoping that you'll continue\nresearch in Storage Systems.\c“From BILL\n… … … … … … … …”
That RUSTURF TUNNEL there…\cAt first, we had a huge work crew boring\nthrough rock with the latest machinery.\rBut, we had to stop.\cIt turns out that we would have had\na negative effect on wild POKéMON in\rthe area.\cSo, we've got nothing to do but loll\naround here doing nothing.
There's a man digging his way to\nVERDANTURF all by his lonesome.\rHe's desperate to get through.\cHe says that if he digs little by little\nwithout using machines, he won't\rdisturb POKéMON, and he'll avoid\rharming the natural environment.\cI wonder if he made it through yet.
To get to VERDANTURF without using\nthis TUNNEL, you'd have to cross the\rsea to DEWFORD, sail on to SLATEPORT,\rthen travel through MAUVILLE.
Did you hear? The TUNNEL to VERDANTURF\nhas gone through!\cSometimes, if you hope strongly enough,\ndreams do come true.
Hehehe!\cWith this METEORITE, that thing in\nMT. CHIMNEY will…
Heh?\cI don't know who you are, but if you get\nin the way of TEAM MAGMA, don't\rexpect any mercy!
Hold it right there, TEAM MAGMA!\cYou're badly mistaken if you think you\ncan have your way with the world!
Hehehe!\nEven TEAM AQUA joins us!\cBut it's too much trouble to deal with\nyou all…\cHeh, it doesn't matter!\cWe've got the METEORITE, so off to\nMT. CHIMNEY we go!\cHehehe! Be seeing you, you TEAM\nAQUA dingbats!
ARCHIE: Didn't I see you before?\nAt SLATEPORT's MUSEUM?\cAh, so your name is [PLAYER].\cAt the time, I thought you were one\nof TEAM MAGMA's goons.\cHumph…\nYou're one odd kid.\cTEAM MAGMA is a dangerous group of\ntotal fanatics.\cThey engage in destruction, claiming\nto expand the land mass.\cThey are the rivals to us,\nthe sea-loving TEAM AQUA!
BOSS, we should give chase to\nTEAM MAGMA…
ARCHIE: Yes, yes, we must!\nWe've got to hurry.\cThere's no telling what TEAM MAGMA\nwill do at MT. CHIMNEY!
ARCHIE: [PLAYER], you should keep\nan eye out for TEAM MAGMA, too.\cFarewell!
I… I'm COZMO…\nI'm a PROFESSOR…\cTEAM MAGMA asked me to guide them\nto METEOR FALLS…\cBut they tricked me.\nThey even took my METEORITE away…\cAnd then another similar bunch,\nTEAM AQUA showed up.\cAfter that…\nI don't understand any of it.\cBut that TEAM MAGMA…\cWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
PROF. COZMO: But that TEAM MAGMA…\cWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
This is where we DRAGON users do our\ntraining.\cThe CHAMPION even visits.\nNow do you see how special it is here?
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!
The road ahead remains long and harsh.\cWhen will my POKéMON and I become\nthe best?
I want to know more about your power.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.
Since we met, we have trained hard\nwith our sights on number one.\cHelp us see how much stronger we've\nbecome!
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!
You've obviously kept up your\nPOKéMON training.\cSo long as you remain strong, I, too,\ncan become stronger!
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\rWe've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.\nWe've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cCome to think of it, I've yet to beat\nmy dear wife in a battle.
JOHN: Well, well, what a young TRAINER!\cWill you battle with us? If so, you'll\nhave to return with more POKéMON.
JOHN: Young TRAINER, if the chance\narises, will you battle with us again?
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cThe bond we share as a couple could\nnever be broken.
JAY: Oh, dear.\nWe've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage…\cIf we ever argued, we always settled\nit with a POKéMON battle…
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young\nTRAINER?\cIf you'd care to battle with us, you'll\nhave to come back with more POKéMON.
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\rWe've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.\nWe've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: Married for fifty years…\cOn reflection, the dear wife and I,\nwe battled day in and day out…
JOHN: Well, well, what a young TRAINER!\cWill you battle with us? If so, you'll\nhave to return with more POKéMON.
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\cWe've supported each other all that\ntime. We've made ourselves strong.
JAY: Oh, dear.\nWe've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage…\nMany things have happened.\cI hope that we will continue to make\nhappy memories together.
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young\nTRAINER?\cIf you'd care to battle with us, you'll\nhave to come back with more POKéMON.
What, are you coming?\nCome and get some, then!
PEEKO: Pii pihyoh!
Grah, keelhaul it all!\cThat hostage POKéMON turned out to\nbe worthless!\cAnd to think I made a getaway…\nIn this tunnel to nowhere!\cHey! You!\nSo you want to battle me?
Urrrggh! My career in crime comes to\na dead end!
This is plain not right…\cThe BOSS told me this would be a\nslick-and-easy job to pull.\cAll I had to do was steal some package\nfrom DEVON.\cTch!\nYou want it back that badly, take it!
PEEKO!\nAm I glad to see you're safe!
PEEKO owes her life to you!\cThey call me MR. BRINEY.\nAnd, you are?\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cAh, so you are [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI sincerely thank you!\cNow, if there's anything that troubles\nyou, don't hesitate to tell me!\cYou can usually find me in my cottage\nby the sea near PETALBURG WOODS.\cCome, PEEKO, we should make our way\nhome.\cPEEKO: Pihyoh!
… …\cWhy can't they keep digging?\nIs the bedrock too hard?\cMy beloved awaits me in VERDANTURF\nTOWN just beyond here…\cIf RUSTBORO and VERDANTURF were\njoined by this tunnel, I could visit\rher every day…\cBut this…\nWhat am I to do?
To get from RUSTBORO to VERDANTURF,\nyou need to go to DEWFORD, then pass\rthrough SLATEPORT and MAUVILLE…
Wow! You shattered that boulder\nblocking the way.\cTo show you how much I appreciate it,\nI'd like you to have this HM.
That HM contains STRENGTH.\cIf a muscular POKéMON were to learn\nthat, it would be able to move even\rlarge boulders.
WANDA!\nNow I can see you anytime!\cWANDA: That's…wonderful.\cPlease, take some rest at my home.
On the other side of this rock…\nMy boyfriend is there.\cHe… He's not just digging the tunnel\nto come see me.\cHe works his hands raw and rough\nfor the benefit of everyone.
What do you call a wild man up in the\nmountains? A mountain man, right?\cSo why don't they call a POKéMON in\nthe mountains a mountain POKéMON?
My POKéMON…\nRan out of power…
They halted development here to\nprotect POKéMON, right?\rThere's a feel-good story!
Hey, you.\nIt gets awfully dark ahead.\rIt'll be tough trying to explore.\cThat guy who came by earlier…\nSTEVEN, I think it was.\cHe knew how to use FLASH, so he ought\nto be all right, but…\cWell, for us HIKERS, helping out those\nthat we meet is our motto.\cHere you go, I'll pass this on to you.
Teach that hidden move FLASH to\na POKéMON and use it.\cIt lights up even the inky darkness\nof caves.\cBut, to use it, you need the GYM BADGE\nfrom DEWFORD's POKéMON GYM.
My name is STEVEN.\cI'm interested in rare stones,\nso I travel here and there.\cOh?\nA LETTER for me?
STEVEN: Okay, thank you.\cYou went through all this trouble to\ndeliver that. I need to thank you.\cLet me see…\nI'll give you this TM.\cIt contains my favorite move,\nSTEEL WING.
STEVEN: Your POKéMON appear quite\ncapable.\cIf you keep training, you could even\nbecome the CHAMPION of the POKéMON\rLEAGUE one day. That's what I think.\cI know, since we've gotten to know each\nother, let's register one another in\rour POKéNAVS.\c… … … … … …
Registered STEVEN\nin the POKéNAV.
Now, I've got to hurry along.
Oh, your BAG is full…\nThat's too bad, then.
Hmmm…\nNot a one to be found…
Hello, have you seen any POKéMON\ncalled SHROOMISH around here?\cI really love that POKéMON.
I was going to ambush you, but you\nhad to dawdle in PETALBURG WOODS\rforever, didn't you?\cI got sick of waiting, so here I am!
You! DEVON RESEARCHER!\cHand over those papers!
Aiyeeeh!\cYou're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\nYou've got to help me, please!
Hunh? What do you think you're doing?\nWhat, you're going to protect him?\cNo one who crosses TEAM AQUA\ngets any mercy, not even a kid!\cCome on and battle me!
You're kidding me! You're tough!
Grrr… You've got some nerve\nmeddling with TEAM AQUA!\rCome on and battle me again!\cI wish I could say that, but I'm out of\nPOKéMON…\cAnd, hey, we of TEAM AQUA are also\nafter something in RUSTBORO.\cI'll let you go today!
Whew…\nThat was awfully close!\cThanks to you, he didn't rob me of\nthese important papers.\cI know, I'll give you a GREAT BALL as\nmy thanks!
Didn't that TEAM AQUA thug say\nthey were after something in\rRUSTBORO, too?
Uh-oh! It's a crisis!\nI can't be wasting time!
You're loaded with items.\nI can't give you this GREAT BALL.
I caught a whole bunch of POKéMON!\cGo, go, go!\nMy BUG POKéMON team!
I have all these POKéMON,\nbut I couldn't win…
I caught a bunch of POKéMON.\nNow I'm out of POKé BALLS.
If you take BUG POKéMON to school,\nyou get to be instantly popular!
I can't be popular if I lose.
If you have a big BUG POKéMON,\npeople respect you for it.
I want a rematch when my BUG\nPOKéMON grow up!\cI'm registering you in my POKéNAV!
I want a rematch when my BUG \nPOKéMON grow up!\cI'm registering you in my POKéNAV!
My BUG POKéMON have grown.\nI'll be popular again.
I can't be popular if I lose.
You get to be popular if you have\nstrong POKéMON, right?\rSo, I've been training hard.
Yo, there!\nYour POKéMON doing okay?\cIf your POKéMON are weak and you want\nto avoid battles, you should stay out\rof tall grass.
Sometimes, there are things on the\nground even if you can't see them.\cThat's why I always check where I'm\nwalking.
Oh, neat!\nThat's the BADGE from RUSTBORO GYM!\cYou must be a TRAINER.\nYou should try using this item.
It's a MIRACLE SEED.\nIf a POKéMON holds that item, its\rGRASS-type moves become stronger.\cBesides MIRACLE SEED, I think there are\nother convenient items for POKéMON\rto hold.
TRAINER TIPS\cAny POKéMON that appears even once\nin a battle is awarded EXP Points.\cTo raise a weak POKéMON, put it at the\nleft of the team list.\cAs soon as a battle starts, switch it\nout. It will earn EXP Points without\rbeing exposed to any harm.
TRAINER TIPS\cIn addition to Hit Points (HP), POKéMON\nhave Power Points (PP) that are used to\rmake moves during battle.\cIf a POKéMON runs out of PP, it must be\ntaken to a POKéMON CENTER.
The power contained in the METEORITE…\cBy amplifying its power with this\nmachine, MT. CHIMNEY's volcanic\ractivity will instantly intensify…\cIts energy will grow deep inside\nthe crater and…\rFufufu…
MAXIE: Hm?\nWho are you?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cI'd heard ARCHIE bemoaning a child\nwho's been meddling in TEAM AQUA's\raffairs.\cIt must be you he meant.\cHumph! So you're thinking of\ninterfering with us, TEAM MAGMA?\cNow you listen.\nLong ago, living things used the\rland to live and grow.\cThat is why land is all important!\nIt is the cradle of all!\cThat is why TEAM MAGMA is dedicated\nto the expansion of the land mass.\cIt is for further advancement of\nhumankind and POKéMON!\cAnd for that, we need the power of\nwhat sleeps within this mountain…\cOh! There was no need for you to\nlearn that much.\cBut, no matter!\nI'll teach you the consequences of\rmeddling in our grand design!
What?!\cI, MAXIE, was caught off guard?!
MAXIE: But, enough.\nI will back off this time.\cBut don't think that this is the last\nyou've seen of TEAM MAGMA.\cFufufu…\cEven without the METEORITE, if we\nobtain that ORB… Fufufu…
Hehehe!\cSo you've come all the way here!\cBut you're too late!\nI've already delivered the METEORITE\rfrom METEOR FALLS to the BOSS!
Hehehe…\cEven though I've lost, if our leader\nawakens that thing…
BOSS, hurry!\nGive it the METEORITE's energy!\cHehehe…
We of TEAM MAGMA are working hard for\neveryone's sake.\cLike, if that thing's power made more\nland, there'd be more places to live.\cEveryone'd be happy!
Hunh?\nWhat do you mean I lost?
Our BOSS says, “It will make everyone\nhappy.”\cBut why does everyone keep getting\nin our way?
If there were more land, I'd be able\nto get a big house of my own!\cI'm going to build it on hardened lava!
My dream of a big house…
A kid like you, you ought to be\nsplashing about in the waves!
That annoying TEAM AQUA…\nThey always mess with our plans!
METEORITES pack amazing power!
You'd better not mess with us!\cWe're trying to awaken that thing\nfor the benefit of everyone!
We're TEAM MAGMA!\cThey're TEAM AQUA!\cIt totally annoys me that they'd\nuse a name like ours!
Yeah!\nDouse them in fire!
We're going to keep making more land!
Bufoh!
ARCHIE: Grr, [PLAYER]!\nI should've guessed you'd show up!\cSee for yourself what the fanatics\nof TEAM MAGMA are up to!\cThey're trying to inject the stolen\nMETEORITE's power into the volcano!\cDoing something like that will cause\nthe volcano's eruption!
ARCHIE: Grrr…\cI want to stop that MAXIE,\nbut I can't!\cNot when I have my hands full battling\nthree opponents at once!
ARCHIE: [PLAYER]!\nThank you!\cWith your help, we thwarted TEAM\nMAGMA's destructive plan!\cBut… You…\nWhose side are you on?\cAh, it doesn't matter.\cWe will remain vigilant and keep up\nour pursuit of TEAM MAGMA.\c[PLAYER], we shall meet again!
Darn… TEAM MAGMA outnumbers us!\nWe can't keep up with them!
If they expand the land, there'll be\nless habitats for WATER POKéMON!
We're TEAM AQUA!\cThey're TEAM MAGMA!\cIt burns me up that they'd use such\na confusing name!
Bushaa!
LAVA COOKIES are MT. CHIMNEY's local\nspecialty.\cTry one. It's just $200.
Thank you, dear!
Oh, dear. You can't buy a thing if\nyou've not got the money.
Oh, fine then.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious\nmachine…\cThe machine seems to be storing\nenergy in the METEORITE.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious\nmachine…\cDo you want to remove the METEORITE?
[PLAYER] removed the METEORITE from\nthe mysterious machine.
[PLAYER] left the METEORITE where\nit was.
This mysterious machine…\nIt makes no response whatsoever.
[DOWN_ARROW] JAGGED PATH\nLAVARIDGE TOWN AHEAD
I've been to the hot springs and\nrefreshed my tired bones.\rRight now I'm feeling strong!
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!
Well, well, I've lost. I can't call\nmyself an EXPERT now, can I?
Thank you, child. It was fun, as if\nI were battling my own grandchild.\cPlease, come see me again for\na rematch.
If you can mesh your heart with those\nof your POKéMON, why, you should be\rable to achieve great things.
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!
Perhaps your heart has become one\nwith the hearts of your POKéMON.
I've got the fire in me, baby.\nI can't stand it! I have to battle!
Ooh, that was a scorching-hot match!
The heat of MT. CHIMNEY warms\nme up, baby!
I've finally made it to MT. CHIMNEY.\nI want to make my POKéMON battle!
The way you battle…\nIt's like a MT. CHIMNEY eruption!
Like I said, I've finally made it to\nMT. CHIMNEY. It would be a shame if\rI only do a little sightseeing…\cI want to get in some battles and buy\nCOOKIES as souvenirs.
Since I bathed in the hot springs,\nI've been feeling great!\rI'm sure I'm going to win!
Yowch!\nI'm getting a chill out of the water.
I'll have to take another dip in the\nhot springs. Want to join me?\cJust joking!
This is one fine mountain! Plenty of\nhot people around for company!
Oh, you're a real firebrand, too!
I think I need a dip in LAVARIDGE\nHOT SPRING with the locals!
I like little fireballs like you.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.
I'm happily surrounded by hot people\naround these parts. I won't lose!
Gosh, you're still the same\nfirebrand as before!
Actually, it really is hot here.\nI'm overdressed for these parts.
MT. CHIMNEY's JAGGED PASS…\cNow this is what I've always wanted\nin a mountain.\cThis jagged bumpiness…\nIt rocks my soul!
Losing left me bitter!
Yes, I did lose at POKéMON…\cBut, when it comes to the love of\nthe mountains, I have you beat!
This place isn't your casual hike.\nIt's not suited for a picnic.
Ohhh, no!\nThe ground is too bumpy…
Did you know?\cSome people cleverly ride their\nbicycles up this horribly bumpy pass.
Will you ever be back in this area?\nIf you do return, I'd like a rematch.
Picnics are fun wherever you go.\nJust like POKéMON!
I only lost because the ground is\ntoo bumpy!
I'll forget about losing and just\nenjoy this bumpy hike.
JAGGED PASS is hard to walk on.\nIt's a good place for training.
It was all over while we were still\ntrying to find a good footing…
If I had an ACRO BIKE, I'd be able to\njump ledges.
When I get more used to this bumpiness,\nI'll be sure to win!\cCan you register me in your POKéNAV?
I got used to this bumpiness.\nI sing while I climb now.
It's still not easy to battle on this\nbumpy ground…
I should get an ACRO BIKE from RYDEL\nin MAUVILLE CITY…
Wah!\nWhat are you doing here?\cWhat am I doing in a place like this?\cWhat business is it of yours?
Urrrgh…\cI should've ducked into our HIDEOUT\nright away…
Okay, oh-kay!\nI admit it--you're strong!\cDon't worry about me.\nGo wherever you want!
Oh! This boulder is shaking in response\nto the MAGMA EMBLEM!
Aiyeeh! It's awfully scary to shoot\ndown the mountain in one go!
I feel like I'm falling apart…
My bicycle bounced around so much,\nmy rear end's sore…
I climb this hill every day.\nI have confidence in my strength!
Hmm…\nWhat went wrong?
What is that odd rock protrusion\na little up the hill from here?
All sorts of beings wander the slopes\nof MT. PYRE…\cThere is no telling what may happen.\nTake this. It's for your own good.
Have a POKéMON hold that\nCLEANSE TAG.\cIt will help ward off wild POKéMON.
Did you come to pay your respect\nto the spirits of departed POKéMON?\cYou must care for your POKéMON a lot.
This is the final resting place of my\nZIGZAGOON. I cherished it…
Memories of my darling SKITTY…\nMy eyes overflow thinking about it.
Ooch, ouch… There are holes in the\nground here and there.\cI didn't notice and took a tumble from\nthe floor above.
Hey! Are you searching for POKéMON?\nYou came along after me! You're rude!
Ayieeeeh!\nI'm sorry, forgive me, please!
People don't come here often, so\nI thought there'd be rare POKéMON.
LUKE: We're here on a dare.\cHeheh, if I show her how cool I am,\nshe'll fall for me. I know it!\cI know! I'll cream you and show her\nhow cool I am!
LUKE: Whoopsie!
LUKE: Well, we lost but that's okay!\nI'm right here by your side.\rWe'll make it through this dare!
LUKE: If you want to take me on,\nbring some more POKéMON.\cIf you don't, I won't be able to show\noff to my girl how cool I am!
DEZ: I came here on a dare with my\nboyfriend.\cIt's really scary, but I'm with my\nboyfriend. It's okay.\cI know! I'll get my boyfriend to look\ncool by beating you!
DEZ: Waaaah! I'm scared!
DEZ: We're lovey-dovey, so we don't\ncare if we lose!
DEZ: If you want to challenge us, you\nshould bring at least two POKéMON.\cMy boyfriend's strong.\nJust one POKéMON won't do at all.
You are an unfamiliar sight…\nDepart before anything befalls you!
Hmm…\nYou're durable.
Our family has been TRAINERS here\nsince my great-grandmother's time…\cIt is my duty to protect this\nmountain…
Kiyaaaaah!\nI'm terrified!
Nooooooo!\nI lost my wits!
I get freaked out every time I see\nanything move…\cI shouldn't have come here to train…
The rich atmosphere of the mountain\nhas elevated my psychic power!\cA mere child like you…\nYou dream of winning?
I drown in self-pity…
My psychic powers have surely\ngrown several times, but…
Ahahahaha!\cThis is no place for children, least\nof all you!
I lost that cleanly…
This means my training is still not\nenough…\cI've got to keep working toward the\nsummit…\cGo, me!
Why have you come here?
That was amazing!\nYou're a very special TRAINER.
POKéMON no longer of this world.\nPOKéMON that are with you now.\cAnd the POKéMON that you will meet\nin the future…\cThey are all to be equally cherished.\nPlease remember that.
I would like to see your POKéMON\nwhen they grow up some more…\cPlease, I need to see your POKéNAV.
Oh, it's you…\cHave you come to show me your grown\nPOKéMON?
How amazing!\nYou are a special person.
POKéMON no longer of this world.\nPOKéMON that are with you now.\cAnd the POKéMON that you will meet\nin the future…\cThey are all to be equally cherished.\nI see that you've remembered that.
Teacher…\nPlease watch over my progress!
Teacher…\nPlease forgive me!
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests\nhere, will never find true peace…
I love all things horrifying…\nIt's like a disease…\cWhen I'm here…\nI shiver with fear…
Losing, I dislike…
I want to see dreadful things…\nI can't leave…\cStay…\nWon't you stay with me?
When I'm here…\nA curious power flows into me…
The power is ebbing away…
Perhaps the power is from the spirits\nof POKéMON in fitful sleep here…
Fufufu… I lost the match, but…\nI have this little ability…\cWithout ever laying my hands on\nyour POKéNAV… Hiyah!
Behind you…\nWhat is it…
Something faded away…
The POKéMON at rest here…\nSometimes, they play…
Have you lost your bearings?\nHave no fear for I am here!
Weren't you lost?
I had this feeling that a lost TRAINER\nwould be panicked and easy to beat.\cIt's dirty and I won't try it again…
No! Those TEAM MAGMA goons got\nhere ahead of us!\cWe can't fall behind!
I thought you were one of the MAGMAS\nwho happened to come back…
Yeah, so you are strong…\nBut there're a lot of us!
Hah!\nToo bad for you!\cIf you came earlier, you only would've\nhad to battle the wimpy TEAM MAGMA.\cBut since you arrived now, you have\nto take on us toughies!
Urgh… I should've let you take on\nTEAM MAGMA first…
You don't know anything!\nSo why are you messing with us?
You…\nWe saw you at MT. CHIMNEY.\cYou don't belong to either TEAM,\nso why would you be here?
If you're going to mess with anyone,\nlet it be TEAM MAGMA…
Heh, it doesn't matter!\nWe bought ourselves some time!\cThe BOSS should have snatched what\nhe was after!
Oh, I know!\nYou tried to join TEAM MAGMA,\rbut they wouldn't have you!\cWell, don't think that we'll let you\njoin our TEAM AQUA!
If you want to join TEAM AQUA that\nbadly, we can consider it…
We have a great combination going\nwith us members and our leader.
ARCHIE: TEAM MAGMA's MAXIE got ahead\nof us, but we also got what we wanted.\cThe RED ORB preserved at MT. PYRE…\nI, ARCHIE, now have it in my possession!\cFufufu… Now we can bring our ultimate\nobjective to fruition!\cOkay, TEAM!\nWe're pulling out!
Oh, no…\nThis cannot happen…\cNot only the BLUE ORB, but even\nthe RED ORB has been taken…\cThe BLUE ORB and RED ORB must never\nbe separated. They belong together.\cWhat are those men trying to do with\nthe two ORBS?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cOh, yes. Was it TEAM MAGMA who came\nand took the BLUE ORB first?\cWell, in their haste, they left this\nbehind.\cI couldn't imagine what exactly it\ncould be.\cI would like you to have it.\nPerhaps it will be useful in some way.
The BLUE ORB and RED ORB taken by\nthose sinister men…\cThey must never be apart…\nI fear something terrible will happen…
Oh, my goodness…\cYou say that both GROUDON and KYOGRE\nhave been awakened?\cIt is said that the BLUE ORB and\nthe RED ORB quelled the rage of\rthe two POKéMON…\cIt is also said that the true owner\nof the ORBS still exists.\cHowever, no one knows who, or what\nexactly, the ORBS belong to.\cIt could be a human, or perhaps\na POKéMON, but no one knows.
The two men who took the ORBS came\nback to return them on their own.\cThose men…\nPerhaps they are not so evil after all…
The embodiments of the land, sea,\nand the sky…\cThat is said to be the identities of\nthe super-ancient POKéMON…\cIn the same way that we humans and\nPOKéMON have life, our world, too,\ris alive…\cThe super-ancient POKéMON have\ntaught us that…
MT. PYRE is where we calm the spirits\nof POKéMON that have passed on…\cThis is a high place where one can\nsee all of HOENN…\cThe disembodied spirits of POKéMON\nmust find solace here…\cIs it coincidence that you are here…\cWill you hear out my tale? A tale long\ntold in the HOENN region?
It happened long, long ago…\cThe world was wracked by a ferocious\nclash between the POKéMON of the land\rand the POKéMON of the sea…\cThe POKéMON of the land raised\nmountains and created continents…\cThe POKéMON of the sea raised huge\nwaves and carved out oceans…\cTheir fierce duel raged without end.\cThe world was engulfed in massive\ninfernos and vicious storms.\cThe BLUE ORB and the RED ORB brought\nan end to the calamity.\cLight poured from the two ORBS and\nbecalmed the enraged adversaries.\cThe pair, made docile, dove deep into\nthe sea where eventually they\rdisappeared…
I see…\nWell, that, too, is fine…
MAXIE: [PLAYER]…\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …
It is my role to pass on the legends\nof HOENN to future generations.\cAnd the crisis that just ended in\nSOOTOPOLIS rewrote a legend…\cHave you the time to hear the new\nlegend of HOENN?
It happened long, long ago…\cThe world was wracked by a ferocious\nclash between the POKéMON of the land\rand the POKéMON of the sea…\cThe POKéMON of the land raised\nmountains and created continents…\cThe POKéMON of the sea raised huge\nwaves and carved out oceans…\cTheir fierce duel raged without end.\cThe world was engulfed in massive\nfires and vicious storms.\cIt was then that the POKéMON of\nthe sky descended from a storm.\cThe POKéMON, shining a vivid green,\nbecalmed the two enraged POKéMON.\cThen, its duty done, the green POKéMON\nflew off into the wild blue yonder…
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\cOur BOSS isn't here! He's gone off to\nsnatch something important!\c… …\nWhere did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What?\nAre you a TEAM MAGMA grunt?\cI hear that TEAM MAGMA is trying to\nawaken an awesome POKéMON at their\rHIDEOUT.\cBut where might their HIDEOUT be?
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\cOur BOSS isn't here!\nHe's gone off to jack a submarine!\c… …\nWhere did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\cOur BOSS isn't here! He's on his way to\nMT. PYRE on ROUTE 122!\c… …\nWhy did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What?\nAre you a TEAM MAGMA grunt?\cI hear that TEAM MAGMA is after\nan awesome POKéMON at MT. CHIMNEY.\cBut what is that POKéMON like?
What? What? What do you want with\nTEAM AQUA?\cOur BOSS isn't here!\nHe's on his way to SLATEPORT CITY!\c… …\nWhy did he go?\cWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?
Ayiyiyi!\nSuspicious character spotted!
Grrrrr…\nI lost it!
I took the loss for the TEAM,\nbut I did my job…
If you want to know the secret about\nour HIDEOUT, you have me to beat!
I can't win at all…
Our HIDEOUT's secret?\cWell, let's just say…\nThere's a submarine at the far end!\cBut, by now…\nKekekeke…
Fuel supply loaded A-OK!\nIn-cruise snacks loaded A-OK!\cNothing left to do but KO a pesky\nmeddler!
I took a serious licking!
Humph!\nThis was supposed to happen!\cMy mission was to just hold you up!
Yawn… Keeping watch over the\nHIDEOUT bores me. I'll take you on.
Yawn…\nOh, I lost…
If you scurry too much, other TEAM\nAQUA members might get you.
Hey!\nYou there!\cWhich do you think is cooler?\nTEAM AQUA's uniform or TEAM MAGMA's?
I lost in a cool way…
If you have a cool uniform, you look\ngood even in a loss, don't you think?
Hehehe…\cGot here already, did you?\nWe underestimated you!\cBut this is it!\cI'm a cut above the GRUNTS you've seen\nso far.\cI'm not stalling for time.\nI'm going to pulverize you!
Hehehe…\nSo, I lost, too…
Hehehe!\cWhile I was toying with you, our BOSS\ngot through his preparations!
Hehehe!\cOur BOSS has already gone on his way to\nsome cave under the sea!\cIf you're going to give chase, you'd\nbetter search the big, wide sea beyond\rLILYCOVE.\cBut will you find it then?\nHehehe!
Wahahah, I grew weary of waiting!\nYou owe me a battle, too!
Tired of waiting…\nLost and dazed…
BOSS…\nIs this good enough?
Warp panels, the HIDEOUT's pride\nand joy!\cYou're clueless about where you are,\naren't you?\cFluster and tire out the enemy, then\nlower the boom! That's our plan!
What's wrong with you?\nYou're not tired at all!
That reminds me… I can't remember\nwhere I put the MASTER BALL.\cIf I fail to guard it, our BOSS will\nchew me out…
When I joined TEAM AQUA, the first\nthing I had to learn was how these\rwarp panels connected.
I was too occupied thinking about\nthe warp panels…
I'll have to learn about how I can\nbattle more effectively…
“SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1” is painted\non the hull.\cThis is the submarine TEAM AQUA\nstole in SLATEPORT!\cTEAM AQUA must have gone\nashore here.
Hey!\nI remember your face!\cIf you're here, it must mean that\nyou're about to mess with us again!\cA punk like you, do you really think\nyou can take on TEAM AQUA?\cI'd say you're too early by about\na trillion years!\cYou're a perfect fit for the likes of\nTEAM MAGMA!\cSpeaking of TEAM MAGMA, I hear they\nwere spotted near MOSSDEEP.\cThat bunch of goons, they sure don't\nlook good near the sea!
A punk like you, do you really think\nyou can take on TEAM AQUA?\cI'd say you're too early by about\na trillion years!\cYou're a perfect fit for the likes of\nTEAM MAGMA!\cSpeaking of TEAM MAGMA, I hear they\nwere spotted near MOSSDEEP.\cThat bunch of goons, they sure don't\nlook good near the sea!
We don't need a kid around!\nGo on home already!
I want to go home…
I want to get a promotion so I can\nboss around the GRUNTS…
That submarine… It's tiny inside.\nI'm sore all over!
Losing makes me sore!
That submarine we jacked, man,\nit's brutal as a ride.\rIt's way too tight in there!
Ahahahaha!\cHow did you manage to get here without\na submarine?\rWhat an impressive child!\cBut… It won't do to have you\nmeddling about here.\cAnd, I do want payback for what\nhappened at the WEATHER INSTITUTE…\cI'm going to give you a little taste\nof pain! Resign yourself to it!
Ahahahaha!\cOuch!
Ahahahaha!\nYou're so darn strong.\cIt's terribly disappointing that you're\nnot a TEAM AQUA member.\cYou could have enjoyed the fabulous\nworld our BOSS has promised as\rone of us…
For our dream to become real, we need\nthe power of POKéMON.\cBut meddlers like you use the power of\nPOKéMON to mess with us even at\ra place like this!\cLife just doesn't work the way we\nneed it to!
Gwah!
You know, we don't dare question\nthe motives of our leader.\cBut here you are, just some punk,\ngoing up against our BOSS.\cMaybe…\nYou must be something…
Who are you?\nWhere did you come in from?
Lost it…
I can't find the way out!\cI'm not afraid. Don't get me wrong!
Who are you?\nWhere do you think you're going?
I failed to win!
My partner forgot the map in that\nsubmarine!\cHow's that for being useless?
ARCHIE: Hold it right there.
ARCHIE: Fufufu…\nSo it was you, after all.
ARCHIE: Behold!\cSee how beautiful it is, the sleeping\nform of the ancient POKéMON KYOGRE!\cI have waited so long for this day to\ncome…
ARCHIE: It surprises me, how you've\nmanaged to chase me here.\cBut that's all over now.\cFor the realization of my dream,\nyou must disappear now!
What?!\nI lost to a mere child like you?!
ARCHIE: Fufufu…\cI commend you. I must recognize that\nyou are truly gifted.\cBut!\nI have this in my possession!\cWith this RED ORB, I can make KYOGRE…
The RED ORB suddenly began shining\nby itself!
ARCHIE: What?!\cI didn't do anything.\nWhy did the RED ORB…\cWhere did KYOGRE go?
ARCHIE: Hm? It's a message from our\nmembers outside…
ARCHIE: Yes, what is it?\cHm…\nIt's raining heavily?\cGood… That should have happened.\nThat is why we awakened KYOGRE,\rto realize TEAM AQUA's vision of\rexpanding the sea.\cWhat?!\cIt's raining far harder than we\nenvisioned? You're in danger?\cThat can't be…\nThat's just not possible…\cHold your position and monitor\nthe situation!
ARCHIE: There's something wrong…\cThe RED ORB is supposed to awaken\nand control KYOGRE…\cBut… Why?\nWhy did KYOGRE disappear?\cWhy?!
MAXIE: What have you wrought?\cARCHIE… You've finally awoken KYOGRE,\nhaven't you?\cWhat will happen to the world if this\ndownpour continues for all eternity?\cThe world's landmass will drown in\nthe deepening sea…
ARCHIE: W-what?!\nDon't get all high and mighty with me!\cWasn't it you, TEAM MAGMA, that\ninfuriated GROUDON?\cSo long as I have this RED ORB,\nI should be able to control KYOGRE…\cI should be able to control it…
MAXIE: We don't have the time to\nargue about it here!\cGet outside and see for yourself!\cSee if what you've wrought is the\nworld that we desired!
MAXIE: [PLAYER], come on, you have\nto get out of here, too!
Ah, so you are [PLAYER][KUN]?\nI've heard tales of your exploits.\cMy name is WALLACE.\cI was once the GYM LEADER of\nSOOTOPOLIS, but something came up.\cSo now, I've entrusted my mentor JUAN\nwith the GYM's operation.\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cGROUDON and KYOGRE, the two POKéMON\nwreaking havoc here, are considered\rto be super-ancient POKéMON.\cBut there aren't just two super-\nancient POKéMON.\cThere is one more somewhere.\cSomewhere, there is a super-\nancient POKéMON named RAYQUAZA.\cIt's said that it was RAYQUAZA that\nbecalmed the two combatants in\rthe distant past.\cBut even I have no clue as to\nRAYQUAZA's whereabouts…
WALLACE: [PLAYER][KUN], do you perhaps\nknow where RAYQUAZA is now?\cIf you do, please tell me.
WALLACE: The CAVE OF ORIGIN?\cBut that's right here!\nI need you to do better than that!\cPlease, I need you to think about\nwhere RAYQUAZA might be right now.
WALLACE: MT. PYRE?\cBut when I met the old lady there\nearlier, she made no mention of it.\cI very much doubt that the old lady\nwould try to hide something from me…\c[PLAYER][KUN], could you think about this\nmore carefully for me?
WALLACE: Huh? You don't remember?\nHmm… That's a problem…\cCan't you remember somehow?
WALLACE: The SKY PILLAR?\cThat's it!\nIt must be the SKY PILLAR!\c[PLAYER][KUN], there's not a moment to lose!\nWe'll head to the SKY PILLAR right away!
WALLY: Hi! [PLAYER]!\cI bet you're surprised to see me here!\cI made it all the way here, and it's\nall thanks to you!\c[PLAYER], losing to you that time\nmade me stronger!\cBut I'm not going to lose anymore!\cI'm going to win! For the POKéMON who\ngave me courage and strength!\cOkay… Here I come!
Wow!\n[PLAYER], you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you today,\n[PLAYER], but one of these days, I'll\rcatch up to you!
WALLY: Hi! [PLAYER]!\cI've gotten stronger since that last\ntime! I wanted to show you, [PLAYER]!\cOkay… Here I come!
Wow!\n[PLAYER], you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you this time,\ntoo… But one of these days, [PLAYER],\rI'm going to catch up to you…\cAnd challenge the POKéMON LEAGUE!
I've made it this far a couple times,\nbut the last stretch is so long…
My dream ends here again…
You've made it this far. Keep the\nmomentum going and become the\rCHAMPION! If anyone can, it's you!
I didn't come all this way to lose now.\nThat possibility doesn't exist!
Impossible…\nI lost?
I lost here…\cThat means I lack the qualifications\nto become the CHAMPION…
This seemingly infinite and harsh road\nlives up to its name of VICTORY.
Your battle style is fantastic…
You seem to have the potential for\nbecoming the CHAMPION.
What is the VICTORY ROAD?\nI'll tell you if you win!
Okay!\nWell done!
Getting through here safely--that's\nthe final test for any TRAINER aiming\rto become the POKéMON CHAMPION.\cThat's why it's called the VICTORY\nROAD.
I have nothing to say to anyone\nthat's come this far. Come on!
This is a disgrace…
Humph, go right on ahead.\nSee if I care.
The thought that I'm getting closer to\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE…\cI'm getting stage fright…
I couldn't do a thing…
The POKéMON LEAGUE became distant\nagain… What a letdown…
To win your way through the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you need the trust of your\rPOKéMON.
Your relationship is based on\nsolid trust.
By being together all the time, trust\ngrows between POKéMON and TRAINERS.
This isn't the goal. It's only a place\non the way to the POKéMON LEAGUE.
That's the way!
You'll do fine, for sure!\nYour POKéMON are all eager to go!
My POKéMON are cosmically\nawe inspiring!
I've never met anyone like you before.
Even outside of battle, I sense\nincredible power emanating from you\rand your POKéMON.
Okay, no need to get your back up!\nRelax, let's take it easy!
Whoa!\nWonderful!
Sure, this is VICTORY ROAD.\cBut it's not all that different from\nthe path you've taken so far.\cTry to enjoy things the rest of\nthe way!
I trained together with my whole family,\nevery one of us!\rI'm not losing to anyone!
Better than my family?!\nIs that possible?!
I was better than everyone in my\nfamily. I've never lost before…\cI've lost my confidence…\nMaybe I'll go home…
I'd heard that there was a tough\nlittle kid around. Do they mean you?
The little shrimp is tough!
The rumors I heard, that tough little\nkid is from PETALBURG CITY.
You must be getting a little tired.
No signs of tiring at all!
VICTORY ROAD and the POKéMON LEAGUE\nare long and grueling challenges.\rBeware of fatigue!
You shouldn't get complacent just\nbecause you have a lot of GYM BADGES.\cThere's always going to be someone\nwho's better than you!
You're better than me!
Gaze on your collected BADGES and\nremember the TRAINERS you've faced.
I've come this far, but the tension's\ngiving me awful stomach pain…
Ooh…\nIt hurts…
I can't help getting all tense knowing\nthat I'm nearing the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cIt's all I can do to feign calm.
The elite among the elite gather in\nthis cave.\cHow are you finding it?
Not rattled in the least bit!
You do have guts! I like that!\nKeep it going!
The penetrating cold around these\nparts is an impediment to training.\cBut with focus, one can overcome!\cWith this FOCUS BAND, buckle down and\nwithstand the cold!
Everything starts with focus!
The door is locked.
Use the BASEMENT KEY?
[PLAYER] used the BASEMENT KEY.\cThe door opened!
The generator is radiating heat that\ncan be felt even at a distance.\cIt looks like it should be turned off\nas soon as possible.
The generator quieted down.
[PLAYER] stepped on the switch.\cClick…\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cThe generator appears to have\nstopped…
What's so funny about having my inner\ntube aboard the ship?
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!
It's not easy throwing POKé BALLS\nwhile hanging on to an inner tube!
Isn't it fun here?\nI get excited just being here!
Ships of this sort are rare, so I'm\ntaking a look around.\cHmhm…\nThere appear to be other cabins…
What on earth would compel you to\ncome here? You must be curious!
Not just curious, but also strong…
The man next door…\cHe says he's just sightseeing,\nbut I don't know about that.
You're such a tough TRAINER!\nLet me register you as a memento!
What on earth would compel you to\ncome back? You must really be curious!
Aren't you too strong?
I'm sure that man's up to something!\nHe just acts so suspiciously!
Waaah!\nI've been found! …Huh?
Oh, you're not my mom.
I'm in trouble with my mom, so I ran.\nKeep it a secret where I am!
When we go out to sea, we SAILORS\nalways bring our POKéMON.\rHow about a quick battle?
Whoops, I'm sunk!
The ship's bottom has sunk into the\ndepths.\cIf a POKéMON knew how to go underwater,\nwe might make some progress…
Yay!\nIt's a ship!
The door is locked.\c“STORAGE” is painted on the door.
[PLAYER] inserted and turned the\nSTORAGE KEY.\cThe inserted KEY stuck fast,\nbut the door opened.
The door is open.
Urrrrppp…\cI'm getting queasy just being aboard\nthis ship…\cIt's not even moving, but…
This is a perfect place to go exploring!\nIt's exciting here!\cI bet there're amazing treasures on\nboard.
DAN: While searching for treasures,\nwe discovered a TRAINER!
DAN: We couldn't win even though\nwe worked together…
DAN: We can't find any treasures…\nI wonder if someone got them already?
DAN: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.
KIRA: Oh?\nWe were searching for treasures.\rBut we discovered a TRAINER instead!
KIRA: Ooh, so strong!
KIRA: Where could the treasures be?\cI've already decided what I'm buying\nwhen we find the treasures!
KIRA: Oh, you don't have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle some other time!
KIRA: Oh, you make me so angry!\nI'm going to register you for that!
DAN: We've been searching for\ntreasures all this time.\cOur POKéMON have grown stronger, too.\nLet us show you, okay?
DAN: You're strong, as usual!
DAN: We can't find any treasures,\nwe lose at POKéMON…\cI want to go home… But if I say that,\nshe gets all angry with me…
DAN: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.
KIRA: Oh? We meet again!\cJust like us, you still haven't given up\nsearching for treasures, have you?\cWant to make it so the loser has\nto give up searching?
KIRA: Oh, we lost again…
KIRA: We're not leaving until we raise\nour POKéMON some more and we find\rthe treasures here!
KIRA: Oh, you don't have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle some other time!
I'm not good at swimming,\nbut I am good at battles!
Oops.\nThat didn't go very well.
Walking around barefoot in this ship\nis kind of gross.
Strength and compassion…\nThose are a TRAINER's treasures!
Ah, there is something about you\nthat sparkles.
In a cabin somewhere on board,\nI saw something sparkle.
I'm investigating this ship on behalf\nof CAPT. STERN.\cHe also asked me to find a SCANNER,\nbut I haven't had any success…
Oh! That's a SCANNER!\cListen, can I get you to deliver that\nto CAPT. STERN?\cI want to investigate this ship a\nlittle more.
This ship is called S.S. CACTUS.\nIt seems to be from an earlier era.
The door is locked.\c“RM. 1” is painted on the door.
The door is locked.\c“RM. 2” is painted on the door.
The door is locked.\c“RM. 4” is painted on the door.
The door is locked.\c“RM. 6” is painted on the door.
[PLAYER] inserted and turned the\nKEY.\cThe inserted KEY stuck fast,\nbut the door opened.
It's bright and shiny!\nBut it's just trash…
The door is closed.
WALLACE: Oh, my, I'm terribly sorry!\cIn my haste, I didn't notice that\nI'd left you behind!\cI've opened the locked door of\nthe SKY PILLAR.\c[PLAYER][KUN], let's be on our way!
WALLACE: It's an earthquake!\cThere's not a moment to waste!\nWe've got to hurry!
WALLACE: Hmm…\nThe situation is getting worse…
WALLACE: This isn't good…\cThe weather distortion is spreading\neven here…\c[PLAYER][KUN].\cRAYQUAZA should be farther up\nfrom here.\cI'm worried about SOOTOPOLIS.\nI've got to go back.\cEverything is in your hands now.\nDon't fail us!
The awakened RAYQUAZA flew off…
When TEAM MAGMA has roll call, we get\nimportant guarding assignments in\rthe order that we line up.\cThat's why I'm stuck off in this corner.\nI'm always late to roll call!
I'm always late for training sessions,\ntoo!\cI hate to say it, but I'm wimpy…
Okay, I'll try to put a little more\neffort into things from now on…
Our leader told us to dig into\nMT. CHIMNEY, so we dug and dug.\cAnd in the course of digging, we came\nacross something that blew our minds!\cWhat did we find?\cFuhahaha!\nI'll tell you if you beat me!
Arrgh!\nTaken down!
I won't tell you after all.\nYou'll find out when you get there!\cIt'd be better if you saved surprises\nto the end, don't you think?
What, what, what?\cOnly TEAM MAGMA members are supposed\nto be in here!\cBut you're not dressed in TEAM MAGMA's\nuniform…\cYou rouse my suspicion!\nBattle with me!
Aiyiyi…\nMy pride as a TEAM MAGMA member…
If you suffer from chills, you should\njoin TEAM MAGMA.
Hold it right there!\cYou don't really expect me to keep\nmy trap shut and let you waltz by me?
Ooh wow!\nI concede!
Maybe it would've been better if I did\njust let you go unchallenged…
Ahah!\nAn intruder!
Graaah!
I've already lost.\cDo I really need to keep running\naround in a circle?
Oh, oh!\nAn intruder!
Mutter…
Actually, I'm no expert at battling…
I don't have a bone to pick with you.\nI'm just following orders!
I may have lost, but…
We dug up something beyond belief!\nAnd, we got the BLUE ORB!\cAll that's left is for our leader to…\nFufufu… Fwahahaha!
I can't stand heat. Maybe I should've\njoined TEAM AQUA instead…
Yeah, I really may not be right for\nTEAM MAGMA…
Don't you get lonely for the sea\nbeing in a place like this?
You can hear tremors here sometimes.\cCould it be the volcano rattling?\nOr is it GROU…\cWhoops!\nNo, no, never mind!
You're a fiery battler.\nJust like a volcano!
You just happened to win this time,\nbut that doesn't matter.\cTEAM MAGMA's goal is about to be\nreached!
One of our guys was freaking out that\nhe lost his MAGMA EMBLEM…\cWait a minute!\nWas it you who found it?
I'm having trouble believing this…
I'm getting this feeling that our plan\nis going to end in failure…
What did I do to deserve this guard\nposting?\cMy left ear is burning up!
I'm getting heat exhaustion…
Do you think it's odd that we're wearing\nhoods in this magma-filled volcano?
We joined so we can help our leader\nachieve his fantastic vision.\cI don't care if you're with TEAM AQUA\nor if you're just some kid passing by.\cNo one interferes with us and gets\naway with it!
Oh, no!\nYou're not to be trusted at all!
Listen to me.\nTEAM MAGMA is right!\cDon't listen to TEAM AQUA.\nDon't believe their lies!
I understand everything our leader\nsays. But you know what?\cDoing stuff like digging up a super-\nancient POKéMON and ripping off\rsomeone's METEORITE…\cI think we're going a little too far.\nWhat do you think?
Yeah, I think we are doing something\nwrong somehow.
You know, losing to you cleared my mind.\cThe next time I see our leader,\nI'm going to ask him about what we do.
I want to see GROUDON, too, but they\nwon't let me see even its tail…\cIt's got me feeling really frustrated.\cOh, no!\nI blabbed about GROUDON!
I guess it's impossible to win if one\ndoesn't have a calm mind…
I wonder if GROUDON even has a tail?
Fuhahaha!\nSoon! Very soon!\rOur grand objective will be achieved!
Grrr…\nI've come so far, but now this?
MAXIE, sir!\nAn intruder is headed your way!
You're not finished yet!\nYou're not getting by me easily!
Was I that easy to knock down?
C-come on, one more match…
Hehehe!\nYou made it this far, so I'll tell you!\cThat's right!\nUp ahead, GROUDON is sleeping!\cMAXIE went to GROUDON just seconds\nago!\cIt's going to awaken real soon!\nHehe! Hehehe!
Taken down again…\nHehe…
…And while you wasted time with me,\nMAXIE should have awakened GROUDON…
MAXIE: GROUDON…\cNothing could awaken you from your\nsleep bathed in magma…\cThis BLUE ORB is what you sought.\nWasn't it?\cI have brought you the BLUE ORB.\nLet its shine awaken you!\cAnd show me…\nShow me the full extent of your power!
MAXIE: GROUDON!\nWhat's wrong?\cWasn't the BLUE ORB the key?\cGROUDON!\nWhere have you gone…
MAXIE: Oh, so it was you?\cI've seen you poking around uninvited\nhere and there…\cI get it now!\nYou must have pulled a cheap stunt!
What makes you so adept at handling\nPOKéMON?
MAXIE: There has to be some reason\nwhy GROUDON fled…\cThat's what you're trying to say,\naren't you?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cHumph…\nYou think I didn't know that?\cWith GROUDON gone, there is no longer\nany need for this blasted volcano.\cI am going after GROUDON, so this\nis where we part!
You found the ROOT FOSSIL.\cIf this FOSSIL is taken, the ground\naround it will likely crumble away…\cTake the ROOT FOSSIL anyway?
[PLAYER] left the ROOT FOSSIL alone.
You found the CLAW FOSSIL.\cIf this FOSSIL is taken, the ground\naround it will likely crumble away…\cTake the CLAW FOSSIL anyway?
[PLAYER] left the CLAW FOSSIL alone.
[PLAYER] found the ROOT FOSSIL.
[PLAYER] found the CLAW FOSSIL.
STEVEN: Oh, wow, [PLAYER][KUN].\nI'm amazed you knew where to find me.\cDo you, uh…maybe think of me as\njust a rock maniac?\cNo, that can't be right.\cWe battled alongside each other at\nthe SOOTOPOLIS SPACE CENTER.\cYou should have a very good idea\nabout how good I am.\cOkay, [PLAYER][KUN], if you're going to mount\na serious challenge, expect the worst!
You…\nI had no idea you'd become so strong…
STEVEN: Come to think of it, ever since\nour paths first crossed in GRANITE\rCAVE in DEWFORD, I had this feeling.\cI thought that you would eventually\nbecome the CHAMPION.\cMy predictions usually come true.\cAnd where will you go from here?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cFufufu, even I couldn't tell you that.
There's a small indent in the wall.
There's a small indent in the wall.\cUse the SECRET POWER?
Discovered a small cavern!
Want to make your SECRET BASE here?
The box is printed with a POKéMON logo.\cIt's a POKéMON brand moving and\ndelivery service.
SCOTT: Well, hi, hi!\n[PLAYER][KUN], [PLAYER][KUN]!\cSomething's come up, so I have to\ndisembark, but am I glad to see you!\cCongratulations, LEAGUE CHAMPION!\cThere's a place I'd like to invite\nsomeone like you.\cIt's the…\nBATTLE FRONTIER!\cWhat's the place like?\nYou'll understand when you see it!\cI've spoken with the ship's CAPTAIN\nabout this.\cThe next time you take a ferry,\nyou should be able to sail to\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\cOkay, [PLAYER][KUN], I'll be waiting for you\nat the BATTLE FRONTIER!
This ferry is built to plow through\nfast-running currents.\cWe hope you enjoy your voyage with us.\nFeel free to explore the ship.
We hope you enjoy your voyage on\nour ferry.
We have made land in SLATEPORT CITY.\nThank you for sailing with us.
We have made land in LILYCOVE CITY.\nThank you for sailing with us.
It'll be some time before we make land,\nI reckon.\cYou can rest up in your cabin if you'd\nlike. Your cabin's No. 2.\cThe bed in there is soft and plushy.\nI can attest to how comfy it is!
We've arrived!
Go visit other cabins.\nTRAINERS bored of the boat trip will\rbe itching to battle.
Enjoy your cruise!
The horizon spreads beyond\nthe porthole.
MR. BRINEY: Welcome aboard, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cThey made me honorary captain of\nthe S.S. TIDAL!\cYou can call me CAPTAIN BRINEY now!\cYou know, I retired once before,\nbut when I saw this majestic ship…\cLet me just say, it stirred my sleeping\nsoul as a sailor!
PEEKO: Pihyo pihyohyo…
Cabin 1
Cabin 2
Cabin 3
Cabin 4
Arrrgh! I'm fed up and dog-tired of\ncleaning this huge place!\cLet's have a quick battle!
Little bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!\cThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
This is the bottom of the ship's hull.\nThere's plenty of room.\rIt'll be alright for a POKéMON battle.
Big bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!\cThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
There's a bed…\nLet's take a rest.
I often sail to LILYCOVE CITY.\cI enjoy attending CONTESTS,\nyou see.
That was an enjoyable match!
I get so excited imagining what kinds\nof POKéMON I'll get to see in the next\rCONTEST. The anticipation of it thrills!
Are your friends strong?
Your friends are, indeed, strong.
Friends need not be human.\nFor me, POKéMON are treasured friends!
Child…\nDid you knock on the door?
A loss is to be accepted without haste\nor panic.
To be never ruffled in any situation is\nthe GENTLEMAN's code of conduct.
JED: I feel a little shy about this, but…\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
JED: Sigh…
JED: It's the first time that our lovey-\ndovey power couldn't prevail!\rYou must be an awesome TRAINER!
JED: You only have one POKéMON?\nIsn't that just too lonesome?
LEA: I feel a little silly, but…\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
LEA: Oh, boo!
LEA: I can't believe it!\nOur lovey-dovey power failed…\rYou must be an awesome TRAINER!
LEA: I wanted to battle…\nBut you don't even have two POKéMON…
Ah, you've come just in time.\cI'm bored, you see.\nYou may entertain me.
…That will do.
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire\na yacht for me.\rA yacht for me and POKéMON!
Oh, you're such an adorable TRAINER.\nWould you like to have tea?\rOr would you rather battle?
I see.\nYou're the active sort.
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its\ncharms, I must say…\cBut, I will admit there is an appealing\nside to touring HOENN by ferry.
Uh… Hi! I… I'm not acting suspicious!\nUh… You can have this! For free!\cIt… Honestly, I didn't SNATCH it from\nsomeone! I'd never do such a thing!\rIt's clean! You can use it!
SNATCH steals the beneficial effects\nof certain moves before they can be\rused by a foe or ally.
This is the BATTLE DOME!\nYour path to the invincible superstar!
This is the BATTLE FACTORY!\nSeek out the toughest POKéMON!
This is the BATTLE PIKE!\nChoose one of three paths!
This is the BATTLE TOWER.\cTRAINERS bring their best-raised\nPOKéMON for elimination-style matches.
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?
[PLAYER] doesn't have the TICKET…\cI'm terribly sorry.\cYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.
[PLAYER] flashed the TICKET.\cPerfect! That's all you need!\cAnd where would you like to go?
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
Please sail with us another time!
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.
Then, where would you like to go?
I'm the best out of all my friends.\nBut here…\rI've been useless!
I want to go to the BATTLE TOWER,\nbut I can't find it even though I have\ra map of the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cThis place is just too big!
I wanted to take a challenge as soon\nas I arrived here.\cBut on the way, I got seasick…\nUrrrrp…
It's not as if just anyone can come\nhere, you know?\cOnly those TRAINERS who've been\nrecognized as tough are brought here.\cThat's why many TRAINERS don't even\nknow about the BATTLE FRONTIER.
Hey, bro…\cAre you sure we can make challenges\neven if we don't have any POKéMON?
Uh…\nI'm sure it'll be okay.\cI think…\cBut remember that big scary guy?\nHe said, “I'll lend you POKéMON!”
That's the BATTLE FACTORY.\nYou can rent strong POKéMON there.\cBut it makes me wonder.\nWho's raising those rental POKéMON?
I'm scared of going into the BATTLE\nPIKE because of SEVIPER…\cB-but I came all the way here, so I will\ntry to conquer everything!\r…Shudder…
Let's play rock, paper, scissors!\nOne, two, three!\c… … … … … …
Yay! I won!\nI will take the BATTLE PIKE challenge!
Oh, no…\nI lost.\cI guess I'm not very lucky today.\nI'll put off my BATTLE PIKE challenge\runtil tomorrow.
I believe I'm the only person here who,\nfor some unknown reason, would choose\rfishing over battling.\cHuh? You can't catch anything here?\nThat's disappointing…
Today, I'm going to keep battling, no\nmatter what, until I get a Symbol.
Oh? You're off to challenge\nthe BATTLE DOME?\cI'll wish you the best of luck.\nLet us both win our way up and meet\rin challenges.
Grandpa, over here!\nThe BATTLE DOME is here!\rGo get 'em, Grandpa!
Ah, so this here is the BATTLE DOME?\nI won't let GENTLEMEN beat me!\cBut where is the entrance?
There used to be nothing here not all\nthat long ago.\cBut, now look at this place! Amazing!\nI'll bring my mother out to see this.
I've finally arrived at the BATTLE\nFRONTIER!\cI'm sure to grab attention with\nmy looks and ability!
Munch, munch…\cIt looks like this square's filled with\ntough people.\cMunch, munch…
Crunch, munch…\cA while back, I met this older girl\nat the BATTLE PIKE.\cShe had these eyes that were scary\nin a real ornery way.\cCrunch, munch…\cShe got all furious: “Will you quit\neating!” Then she whaled on me.\cIt was a hair-raising kind of\nscary experience, sure enough.\cCrunch, munch…
Huh? Will you listen to yourself?\nThat's nothing!\cWhy, the last time I cheered for him,\nour eyes met and sparks flew!
Whaaaaaat?!\nPfft!\cThat only happened because\nI happened to be sitting next to you!\cThe DOME ACE only looked our way\nbecause my cheering was so loud!
Oh, shush!\nKeep that racket down!\cYou fair-weather fans should stick\nto cheering for some GYM LEADER!\cThe DOME ACE is mine!\nThe only idol for me!
Those people squabbling over there…\cIt's hard to believe, but they once\nwere TRAINERS, and good ones, too.\cThey used to be incredibly tough,\nand they were famous, too.\cBut they were obliterated by this\ncertain TRAINER at a tournament.\cThey were so thoroughly whipped,\nthey became smitten by the TRAINER.\cNow they're just fans of the TRAINER.\nThey go cheer for their idol at the\rBATTLE DOME every day now.
I heard a rumor that someone saw\na POKéMON with an unusually long tail\rsomewhere in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cIt must be adorable. I'm sure of it…\cOh, challenges can wait. I feel driven\nto find the delightful creature!
I'll direct you to your BATTLE ROOM now.
Excuse me!\cYou didn't save before you quit your\nchallenge last time.\cBecause of that, your challenge so far\nhas been disqualified. Sorry!

That was fun…\cI have never had a POKéMON battle\nso enjoyable before…\cI wish I could battle with you again…
This is the BATTLE TOWER!\nKeep the win streak as the toughest\rTRAINER!
This is the BATTLE PALACE!\nKeep your eyes on POKéMON battles!
This is the BATTLE ARENA!\nLet the toughest teams gather!
This is the BATTLE PYRAMID!\nAdvance through the Battle Quest!
BATTLE FRONTIER RANKING HALL\nSet your sights on new records!
BATTLE POINT EXCHANGE SERVICE CORNER\nExchange your Battle Points!
Wow!\nIt's huge!\cThe BATTLE TOWER feels special.\nIt's different from the others.
My grand ambition is to conquer both\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER and the POKéMON\rLEAGUE.\cAnd if my dream comes true…\cI… I'm going to ask MIMI next door\nif she will be friends with me!
The BATTLE PYRAMID's too harsh!\nI just can't make it to the top!\cSince I'm out of options, maybe I can\nclimb the outside…
I thrive in darkness…\nYes… What is worthy of me?\rNone other than the BATTLE PYRAMID…\cWhat say you to wandering in darkness\nand in utter and total desperation?
I didn't sleep for a week, but then\nI put together the ultimate team!\cI can't see myself losing, no joke.\nWe're storming the BATTLE ARENA!
Did SCOTT bring you here, too?\nWhat is it with that guy?\cIt sounds like he really does know\nhow to spot talented TRAINERS, but…\cI've never seen him battling in person\never.
ZIGG!\nI believe in you, little buddy!\cI'll make my little ZIGG any favorite\ntasty treats you like if you win!
ZIGZAGOON looks vacant…
People call me a busybody,\nbut I can't help it.\cYour hat's on crooked!\nOh, no, trash on the ground!\rOops, it's almost dinnertime!\cI don't know if I can stand to just\nwatch at the BATTLE PALACE…
I may not look that impressive now,\nbut I once beat a GYM LEADER.\cWho knows, maybe I should give it\nanother shot at glory.
I'm fast on my BIKE, and that goes for\nthe way I battle, too.\cI win matches in the blink of\nan eye!
I'm better than my daddy\nat POKéMON.
Go on, my baby sweetie!\nGo rack up some wins for Daddy!\cYou're just like your mother,\nso you'll be dominating!
It wasn't easy getting here,\nbut I'd heard about this knockout\rpretty girl at the BATTLE ARENA.\cInstead of her, do you know what\nI found?\cA whole teeming mob of sweaty,\nstinky, and primitive martial artists!
I sometimes see this really important-\nlooking old man going in there.\cHe has these really awesome POKéMON.\nHe seems really nice, though.
Do you know it?\nThe legend of the BATTLE PYRAMID?\cWhen there comes a confident TRAINER\nreaching for the golden pinnacle,\rthere shall appear a man among men.\cDon't know that legend?\nWell, of course not!\rI just made it up!\cWhat's it supposed to mean?\nThat, my friend, I can't say!
Man! Oh man!\nI've never lost once before!\cBut I got wiped out with no saving\ngrace at all!\cAnd then I'm told I don't have any\ntalent?! Man!
This guy ran into a horribly tough\nTRAINER while he was on the BATTLE\rTOWER challenge.\cNow look at him…\cYou need to be cautious if you ever\ndecide to go to the BATTLE TOWER.
Yes!\nI've finally got enough Battle Points!\cI guess I'll trade for another giant\nplush DOLL!
Oh, yeah, okay!\nSo this is the RANKING HALL!\cI'd like to go down in history as\na super champ and have my name\rrecorded here for posterity.
With you by my side, I can do anything.
Ooh, darling, you are so wonderful!\cOoh, I just can't wait anymore!\cLet's go to a MULTI BATTLE ROOM\nright this instant!\cIf we get together in the BATTLE SALON,\nthe power of our love will overcome\reveryone we meet.\cWhy, before us, darling, everything\nwill topple like dominoes!
The BATTLE FRONTIER isn't exclusively\nfor tough TRAINERS.\cMany people with special abilities\nhave been invited, it seems.\cThat man SCOTT…\cHe may have built this place to serve\na bigger objective…
Excuse me, young one.\nHave you good eyesight?\cThere is an odd tree past here, and to\nmy tired eyes it seems to wiggle.
Excuse me, young one.\nHave you a good memory?\cI have this feeling there once was\nan odd tree past here.
I…\nI saw it!\cThere was a sticky sort of a POKéMON\nwith a long tail up ahead!\cIt was hiding under a boulder, and\nit kept staring at me!
Please find a partner from out of\nthe TRAINERS gathered here.
[PLAYER], you have not found a partner\nfor your tag team.\cWould you like to quit looking and\nreturn to the reception counter?
Then, please find a partner from\nthe TRAINERS gathered here.

What do I have with me?\nOne [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1] and
one [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1]!\cHey?\nYou'll team up with me, right?
Okay!\cI'll go register!\nLet's be excellent together!
My POKéMON are tough for sure…\nIt's too bad you don't want to team up.
Yay-hey!\nCall me GUITARIST [STR_VAR_1]!
Check out my entourage!\nOne [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1] and
one [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1]!\cYay-hey! Pretty wild, huh?\nWe'll have to do a duet in a tag team!
Yay-hey! Right on!\nI'll do that registration stuff now!
My POKéMON rock hard!\nYou'll be sorry, I tell you!
Pleased to meet you.\nI am [STR_VAR_1], a GENTLEMAN.
I am accompanied by my trusted\n[STR_VAR_1]-using [STR_VAR_2] and
one [STR_VAR_1]-using [STR_VAR_2].\cMay I ask you to join me in a tag-team\npartnership arrangement?
Ah, I thank you for your trust.\nI shall be done with the registration.
That is most unfortunate…\cI shall look forward to the next\nopportunity…
Hello, I'm [STR_VAR_1],\nand I'm a POKéFAN.
I have with me now one [STR_VAR_2]\nthat knows the move [STR_VAR_1] and
one [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1].\cDo you like what you see?\nWhy don't you be my tag partner?
Thank you!\nI'll look after the registration!

Hm!\nI am [STR_VAR_1], and an EXPERT am I!
The POKéMON that I've toughened up are\none [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1] and

You're not going to find many tougher\npartners than me!
I'm BIRD KEEPER [STR_VAR_1]!
What POKéMON do I have?\nOne [STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1] and

Great, thanks!\nI'll look after the registration!

I'm NINJA BOY [STR_VAR_1]!
My POKéMON team consists of one\n[STR_VAR_2] with [STR_VAR_1] and

Where the hearts of TRAINERS\nare put to the test.\cI welcome you to the BATTLE PALACE.\cI accept challenges to the SINGLE\nBATTLE HALLS.
Do you wish to take\nthe SINGLE BATTLE HALL challenge?
In the BATTLE PALACE, there are\nseveral auditoriums for SINGLE BATTLES\rthat are named SINGLE BATTLE HALLS.\cThe SINGLE BATTLES are conducted in\nthe usual way, except with one crucial\rrule that must be obeyed.\cTRAINERS are permitted only to switch\ntheir POKéMON in and out.\cTRAINERS are otherwise forbidden to\ncommand their POKéMON.\cThe POKéMON are to behave according\nto their nature and battle on their own.\cYou must put your trust in your\nPOKéMON and watch over them.\cIf you achieve the honor of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\rwe will present you with Battle Points.\cIf you want to interrupt your\nchallenge, you must save the game.\cIf you don't save before interrupting,\nyou will be disqualified.
When you have fortified your heart\nand POKéMON, you must return.
There are two BATTLE HALLS,\nLevel 50 and Open Level.\rWhich is your choice of a challenge?
Sigh…\cYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for the challenge.\cTo enter, you must provide three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\cThese POKéMON must all be of\nLevel 50 or lower.\cThey also must not be holding\nthe same kinds of items.\cEGGS[STR_VAR_1] ineligible.\cCome back when you have made\nyour preparations.
Sigh…\cYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for the challenge.\cTo enter, you must provide three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\cThey also must not be holding\nthe same kinds of items.\cEGGS[STR_VAR_1] ineligible.\cCome back when you have made\nyour preparations.
Good. Now, you must select your\nthree POKéMON.
I must save before I show you to\nthe BATTLE HALL. Is that okay?
Good.\nNow, follow me.
I feel privileged for having seen\nyour POKéMON's exploits.\cThe results will be recorded.\nI must ask you to briefly wait.
To achieve a 7-win streak…\cThe bonds that bind your heart with\nyour POKéMON seem firm and true.
Your feat will be recorded.\nI must ask you to briefly wait.
For the feat of your 7-win streak,\nwe present you with Battle Point(s).
You seem to have no space for\nour prize.\cYou should return when you have\norganized your BAG.
We have been waiting for you…
I must save before I show you to\nthe BATTLE HALL. Is that okay?
Sigh…\cYou failed to save before you ended\nyour challenge the last time.\cAs a result, your challenge has been\ndisqualified. It is most unfortunate.
[PLAYER] received the prize\n[STR_VAR_1].
For a hardy fellow like me,\nhardy POKéMON are the best.\cOffense is the best defense!\nA relentless attack is the ultimate!\cBut that's not what I wanted to chat\nabout.\cEvery so often a really cute lady\nswings by here.\cShe says that she can tell what\nPOKéMON are thinking.\cI don't know about that part,\nbut she is really cute.\cHuh?\nWhy are you looking at me like that?
Hmm…\cIt appears that the nature of POKéMON\nand the moves that they have been\rtaught are the keys to battle here.\cTo be more precise, it's how well\nthe moves match the nature of\rthe POKéMON.\cIf your POKéMON is in trouble and\nunable to live up to its potential,\ryou may need to examine how well\rits moves match its nature.
My POKéMON is usually very docile.\cBut when it's in a BATTLE HALL,\nit sometimes seems to become\rtransformed into something wicked!\cIt becomes totally intimidating.\nIt's shocking, even.
I wonder what sort of nature a POKéMON\nwould have if it favored enfeebling its\ropponents and chipping away slowly.\cI'd be surprised if it was a LAX nature.\cBut, nah, that can't be right.
Where the hearts of TRAINERS\nare put to the test.\cI welcome you to the BATTLE PALACE.\cI accept challenges to the DOUBLE\nBATTLE HALLS.
Do you wish to take\nthe DOUBLE BATTLE HALL challenge?
In the BATTLE PALACE, there are\nseveral auditoriums for DOUBLE BATTLES\rthat are named DOUBLE BATTLE HALLS.\cThe DOUBLE BATTLES are conducted in\nthe usual way, except with one crucial\rrule that must be obeyed.\cTRAINERS are permitted only to switch\ntheir POKéMON in and out.\cTRAINERS are otherwise forbidden to\ncommand their POKéMON.\cThe POKéMON are to behave according\nto their nature and battle on their own.\cYou must put your trust in your\nPOKéMON and watch over them.\cIf you achieve the honor of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\rwe will present you with Battle Points.\cIf you want to interrupt your\nchallenge, please save the game.\cIf you don't save before interrupting,\nyou will be disqualified.
To defeat the PALACE MAVEN\nand seven TRAINERS in a row…
In honor of the bond you share with\nyour POKéMON, we present you with\rthese Battle Point(s).
Would you like to record your latest\nBATTLE PALACE match on your\rFRONTIER PASS?
The BATTLE HALL rules are listed.
Which heading do you want to read?
Here, POKéMON are required to think\nand battle by themselves.\cUnlike in the wild, POKéMON that live\nwith people behave differently\rdepending on their nature.
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON\nmay prefer to attack no matter what.\cAnother POKéMON may prefer to protect\nitself from any harm.\cYet another may enjoy vexing or\nconfounding its foes.\cDue to its nature, a POKéMON\nwill have favorite moves that it is good\rat using.\cIt may also dislike certain moves that\nit has trouble using.
There are offensive moves that inflict\ndirect damage on the foe.\cThere are defensive moves that are\nused to prepare for enemy attacks or\rused to heal HP and so on.\cThere are also other somewhat-odd\nmoves that may enfeeble the foes with\rstat problems including poison and \rparalysis.\cPOKéMON will consider using moves in\nthese three categories.
When not under command by its TRAINER,\na POKéMON may be unable to effectively\ruse certain moves.\cA POKéMON is not good at using any\nmove that it dislikes.\cIf a POKéMON only knows moves that\ndo not match its nature, it will often\rbe unable to live up to its potential.
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON may\nstart using moves that don't match its\rnature when it is in trouble.\cIf a POKéMON begins behaving oddly\nin a pinch, watch it carefully.
People and POKéMON, they are but\nthe same…\cTheir individual nature makes them\ngood at certain things, and not good\rat others.
Rather than trying to make a POKéMON\ndo what it dislikes, try to let it do\rwhat it likes and is good at doing.\cPut yourself in the POKéMON's position\nand consider what moves it would like.
A POKéMON's nature is a remarkable\nthing…\cSome POKéMON behave in a completely\ndifferent way when they are cornered.
Are you beginning to understand how\na POKéMON's nature makes it behave?
Ah… I see a strong, heartfelt bond\nbetween you and your POKéMON…
Excellent…\nLet me restore your POKéMON.
The 2nd opponent is next.\nAre you prepared?
The 3rd opponent is next.\nAre you prepared?

Now, when you are ready, take courage\nand step forward.
Where the battling spirit of TRAINERS\nis put to the test!\cI welcome you to the BATTLE ARENA!\cI am your guide to the Set KO Tourney!
Now, do you wish to take\nthe BATTLE ARENA challenge?
We await your challenge on\nanother occasion!
In the BATTLE ARENA, we undertake\nthe Set KO Tourney.\cAll participants enter with a team of\nthree POKéMON.\cThe three POKéMON must be lined up in\nthe order in which they are to appear.\cDuring battle, the POKéMON will appear\none at a time in the preset order.\cOnce a POKéMON enters battle, it must\nremain out until the match is decided.\cIf a match remains undecided in\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\cIf you wish to interrupt your challenge,\nplease save the game.\cIf you don't save, you will not be able\nto continue with your challenge.\cIf you pull off the feat of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\rwe will present you with Battle Points.
Before showing you to the BATTLE\nARENA, you must save. Is that okay?
The BATTLE ARENA offers two levels\nof challenge, Level 50 and Open Level.\rWhich is your choice?
Very well, now select your\nthree POKéMON, please.
My dear challenger!\cYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for entry.\cTo qualify, you must bring three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\cThey also must not hold the same\nkinds of items.\cEGGS[STR_VAR_1] ineligible.\cWhen you have made your preparations,\nplease do return.
My dear challenger!\cYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for entry.\cTo qualify, you must bring three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\cThe three different POKéMON\nmust all be Level 50 or lower.\cThey also must not hold the same\nkinds of items.\cEGGS[STR_VAR_1] ineligible.\cWhen you have made your preparations,\nplease do return.
I shall now guide you to\nthe BATTLE ARENA.
My dear challenger!\cYou did not save the game before\nshutting down, did you?\cIt is unfortunate, but that has\nresulted in your disqualification\rfrom your challenge.\cYou may, of course, start with a fresh\nchallenge.
We congratulate you for your splendid\nstring of wins over seven TRAINERS!
Your achievement will be recorded.\nPlease wait while I save the game.
In commemoration of your 7-win streak,\nwe present you with this prize.
[PLAYER] received the prize\n[STR_VAR_1].
Oh?\nYour BAG seems to be full.\cI urge you to clear space and\nreturn for your prize.
Thank you so much for participating!\cPlease wait while I save the game.
We await your challenge on\nanother occasion!
We have been looking forward to\nyour arrival.\cBefore I show you to the BATTLE\nARENA, I must save the game.\rPlease wait.
Shall I record your last BATTLE ARENA\nmatch on your FRONTIER PASS?
I lost on the REFEREE's decision…\cI don't think it was a good idea to only\nuse defensive moves and not attack…
I won in judging!\cLanding hits consistently on\nthe opponent's POKéMON worked!
Our match was declared a draw.\cWhen we ran out of time, both my\nPOKéMON and the opponent's had about\rthe same amount of HP left.
In the BATTLE ARENA, the order of\nPOKéMON is totally important.\cFor example, if your first POKéMON\nhas certain type disadvantages,\rtry making your second POKéMON one\rwith moves that are super effective\ragainst the first one.\cI think that will be a good way of\nmaking an effective team.
The Set KO Tourney's rules are listed.

The Set KO Tourney has special rules,\nunlike standard battles.\cFirst, one battle lasts only\nthree turns.\cIf the outcome is not decided after\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\cThe REFEREE will choose the winner\nbased on how the POKéMON battled.\cAlso, a POKéMON cannot be switched out\nuntil its battle's outcome is decided.
The first judging factor is “Mind.”\nThis factor evaluates how aggressive\rthe battlers were.\cThe judging is based on how often\nthe TRAINERS ordered the use of\roffensive moves.
The second judging factor is “Skill.”\nThis factor evaluates how effectively\rPOKéMON moves were used.\cIf a move worked successfully,\nthe Skill rating goes up.\cIf a move failed, the Skill rating\nis lowered.\cIf it was an offensive move, the Skill\nrating goes up if the move was “super\reffective” and goes down if it was\r“not very effective.”\cThe Skill rating will not go up for\nmoves such as PROTECT and DETECT.\cIf the opponent used PROTECT or\nDETECT, and your POKéMON failed to\rhit with a move, its Skill rating will not\rgo down.
The third judging factor is “Body.”\nThis factor is based on how much HP\rremained at the end of a battle.\cThe rating takes into account how much\nHP a POKéMON had at the start of\rbattle, and what remained at the end.
A victory snatched from the ARENA\nTYCOON, and a seven-TRAINER sweep!\cWe congratulate you on your most\nsplendid challenge!

Would you like to record your last\nBATTLE FACTORY match on your\rFRONTIER PASS?
Hi!\nYou, there!\cAre you thinking that the events here\nare easy since you don't need to have\ra raised team of POKéMON?\cI wouldn't be too sure about winning\nthat easily.\cIf you don't have thorough knowledge\nabout POKéMON and their moves,\rit will be tough to keep winning.
I swapped for a weak POKéMON…\nI thought it was a good kind to have…\cThey wiped the floor with us…
Things haven't been going my way\nat all.\cYou need to check your opponent's\nPOKéMON during battle to see if\rthey're any good.
You know how the staff here give you\na few hints about your next opponent?\cWell, I'm a full-grown man, but I have\ntrouble figuring out their hints.
Like, I'm really tough, but I get bored\nreally easily, so I just kept swapping\rand battling over and over.\cSo anyway, when I kept entering\nBattle Swap events, I noticed they\rvaried the rental POKéMON.
The Battle Swap rules are listed.
Which heading do you want to read?
In a Battle Swap event, you may use\nonly three POKéMON.\cWhether you are renting or swapping,\nyour team may not have two or more\rof the same POKéMON.
You may swap POKéMON only with\nthe TRAINER you have just defeated.\cYou may swap for only those POKéMON\nused by the beaten TRAINER.
After every battle you win, you may\nswap for one of your defeated\ropponent's POKéMON.\cYou will not be able to swap POKéMON\nwith the seventh TRAINER in the event.
There are two key points to be aware\nof when swapping POKéMON.\cFirst, when swapping, you can't check\nthe stats of the POKéMON you are\rabout to receive.\cSecond, the POKéMON on your team\nare lined up in sequence, depending on\rthe order in which you rented them.\cThis sequence remains unchanged\neven when swaps are made.
In the Open Level, the rental POKéMON\nand the opposing TRAINERS' POKéMON\rare all Level 100.
First, we will hold your POKéMON for\nsafekeeping.\cYou may then choose from our\nselection of POKéMON.
Thank you for competing!\nLet us restore your POKéMON!

Sure, there are several places where\nyou can enter DOUBLE BATTLES.\cBut the DOUBLE BATTLE ROOMS of\nthe BATTLE TOWER are, like, basic!\cThey're where you should learn about\nhow DOUBLE BATTLES are played here\rin the BATTLE FRONTIER.
Watch yourself in the battles here.\cI hear there are TRAINERS that have\nstrategies they developed just for\rDOUBLE BATTLES.
Once you're confident and comfortable\nwith DOUBLE BATTLES here, you should\rthink about challenging other places\roffering DOUBLE BATTLES.
All sorts of TRAINERS gather in\nthe BATTLE SALON.\cJust think--you may run into your\nfriends or followers!\rYou should look carefully!
If you're with a friend, head for the\nLINK MULTI BATTLE ROOM.\cIf you play with a strong friend,\nyou can expect to see tough foes!
What amazing news-gathering power!\nMy mentor's like none other!

…What is this place?\nIt's scaring me…

…Huh?\nYou look to me like a tough TRAINER.\cHeheh…\nListen, I have this proposition.\cWe have a little group going here,\nand we play a little game with what\rgoes on in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cThe rules are really simple.\cFirst, we pick one of the facilities\nin the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cThen, we each pick a different TRAINER\nwho's taking that facility's challenge,\rand bet with our Battle Points.\cThe guy who bet on the TRAINER with\nthe best record takes all the Battle\rPoints in the pool.\cSounds simple, huh?\nSo, anyway…
What I'm looking for is a TRAINER who's\ngoing to be challenging the BATTLE\rTOWER's SINGLE BATTLE ROOMS.\cBut so far, I haven't seen a TRAINER\nthat has that winning quality.

Great, great!\nSo, how much can you spot me?

Oh, it's you…\nNice try…\cI hate to break it to you, but I can't\nreturn your Battle Points…\cI guess we'll have to let it motivate\nus to try harder next time!
Oh, yes!\nHello there, champ!\cI knew you could!\nI knew you would!\rWe're both big winners!\cI'll return your Battle Points and,\nof course, a little extra from me!
[PLAYER] obtained\n[STR_VAR_1] Battle Points.
If you're up for another challenge,\nplease do think of me!
Not interested?! You shouldn't be\nso afraid to take a chance!
Oh…
I backed the wrong TRAINER again!\cMaybe I should be battling normally\nlike everyone else…
That TRAINER…\cHe's good, but he gets rattled too\neasily to survive the BATTLE DOME…
Giggle!\nI know a winner when I see one!
Those TRAINERS…\nWhat are they doing?\rThey should be taking challenges.
I wonder if they'll be airing interviews\nwith tough TRAINERS today?
If I opened a restaurant here,\nit'd make money for sure.
Whew…\cI need to take a breather after\nsome intense battles…\cBut even now, I never take a break\nfrom plotting strategy and combos.
SCOTT: Well, hello and welcome!\nHeheh… Sorry about the cramped space.\cAnyway, [PLAYER][KUN], let me formally\nwelcome you to the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cThis is my dream come true.\nIt took me years and years, but I've\rfinally given shape to my dream.
On reflection, it was a terribly long\njourney…\cI left home alone on a quest to find\nstrong TRAINERS.\cNo one can imagine how much effort\nor time it took to make this real.
But that's all in the past.\nNo point dwelling on that!\cAll I want for you is to enjoy battling\nto your heart's content here.\c[PLAYER][KUN], I want you to have this\nas a memento for all the time our\rpaths crossed on our journeys.
[PLAYER] obtained\n[STR_VAR_1] Battle Point(s).
SCOTT: You can check your Battle\nPoints on your FRONTIER PASS.\cThe more success you have here at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER, the more Battle\rPoints you will collect.\cUse your Battle Points the way you\nsee fit, like trading them for items.
I'm expecting great things from you!
SCOTT: Every TRAINER is an individual.\nThey all lead lives of their own.\cBut when they're in a battle,\nit doesn't matter who they are.\cThey're all the same!\cI love the purity of battle,\nwhere everyone is equal.\cThat's why I go everywhere seeking\nTRAINERS who are serious about\rbattling, and invite them here.
SCOTT: Have you met any of\nthe FRONTIER BRAINS?\cBetter yet, have you obtained any\nsymbols from them?\cI handpicked the FRONTIER BRAINS\nas the toughest TRAINERS anywhere.\cBut I'm sure that seeing how tough\nyou are will startle even them!
SCOTT: You don't just train for battle,\nright?\cI think I remember you working on\na POKéDEX as well.\cWell, guess what?\cYou may run into wild POKéMON in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER somewhere…\rFufufu!
SCOTT: Are you enjoying things in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER?\c…Wait a second…\nOh!\cYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've collected the full set\rof silver symbols!\cThat's more than impressive!\nYou are tough, just as I suspected!\cNormally, I wouldn't do something\nlike this, but this is a special time!\cI want you to have this.\nI'm sure you can put it to proper use.
SCOTT: I hope you're enjoying\neverything in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\c…Wait a second…\nOh, my disbelieving eyes!\cYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've gathered up the full set\rof gold symbols!\cThat's more than stupendous!\nYou're incredible, just as I suspected!\c… … … … … …\c[PLAYER], you've got to accept this!\cI think you will be able to\nappreciate the value of my gift!
I must say I have the gift of knowing\na good TRAINER when I see one.\cI'm so glad I had the foresight to\nbring you here!
Your BERRY POCKET seems to\nbe stuffed.
SCOTT: Oh, I heard about you!\nHow you ruled the BATTLE TOWER!\rYou beat over 50 TRAINERS in a row?\cThat's fantastic!\nI want you to have this!
SCOTT: Oh, my! I heard about you!\nHow you overwhelmed the BATTLE TOWER!\rYou beat over 100 TRAINERS in a row?\cThat's ridiculously spectacular!\nYou've got to have this!
I'll be expecting to hear even greater\nthings about you now!
Oops, well, if you have too much\nstuff, come back for this later.
Ehehe!\nI can tell what POKéMON are thinking!\cPlease!\nCan I see your POKéMON?
Boo!\nCheapie!

That's silly! An EGG is asleep!\nI can't talk to it!
How charming!\nThat little lady claims she can\runderstand POKéMON!
I have this feeling that the little girl\nis saying something profound.
I know something!\cThat little girl plays at the red house\na lot!
My POKéMON is a [STR_VAR_2].\nDo you know it?\rIt's quite cute and rather nice.\cThis little one, I could trade with\npride!\cWould you like to trade me a [STR_VAR_1]\nfor my [STR_VAR_2]?
Oh, it's adorable!\nThank you!\rI promise I'll be good to it!\cOh! I hope you'll be good to\nmy [STR_VAR_2], too!
Oh, I'm sorry!\nI don't intend to trade for anything\rbut a [STR_VAR_1].
Oh, you won't?\nWell, that's fine, too.\rPlease come visit us again.
Giggle!\nA SKITTY is so much cuter than I had\rimagined. I'm delighted!
Buhahaha!\cYou couldn't tell it from looking now,\nbut I used to be one tough TRAINER.\cI had a reputation as the toughest\nBEAUTY around, I tell you!\c… … … … … …\cWhat is it now?\nYou don't believe me.\cI'm not like that blowhard woman over\nthere.

Buhahaha!\cAre you back to learn special and\nyet cute POKéMON moves?
Fine, fine, look here!\nWhich move should I teach?
The move [STR_VAR_1], is it?\nThat will be [STR_VAR_2] Battle Points, okay?
Fine, fine, now pick the POKéMON\nI should teach the move to.
What the…\nYou haven't got enough Battle Points!
Do you see how skilled I am now?\nI'll take your Battle Points, thanks!
What's that?\nYou don't want to…\cIf you want to see how skilled I am,\nyou come see me anytime!
Ihihihi!\cI know it's hard to see now, but I used\nto be one fantastic TRAINER.\cI had a reputation as the most\ninvincible SWIMMER around, I tell you!\c… … … … … …\cWhat's wrong?\nYou don't believe me.\cI'm not like that buffoonish woman over\nthere.

Ihihihi!\cHave you come to learn hard and\nyet pretty POKéMON moves?
Those ladies, the way they bad-mouth\neach other, you probably think that\rthey don't get along.\cBut if that were true, they wouldn't\nstay out here together, would they?
When I was just a wee YOUNGSTER,\nthose ladies were strong and beautiful.\cThey were idols among us TRAINERS.\cEven now, age hasn't dulled their\nabilities.\cIn fact, their POKéMON moves have\ngrown even more polished.\cBut… For some reason, I can't help\nbut feel this…\cTime is so cruel…

The front lines of POKéMON battling!\nWelcome to the BATTLE FRONTIER!
For a first-time visitor, we issue\nthe FRONTIER PASS.\cIt's for use at all the facilities\nin the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cHere you are!
[PLAYER] obtained\nthe FRONTIER PASS.
[PLAYER] placed the TRAINER CARD\nin the FRONTIER PASS.
We hope you enjoy all that the BATTLE\nFRONTIER has to offer!
???: Well, if it isn't [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou came out here!
GUIDE: Oh! MR. SCOTT, sir!\nGood day to you, sir!
SCOTT: It's great to see you here,\nit really is!\cI hope you'll take your time and\nexplore everywhere.\cNaturally, I hope you'll also experience\nthe pure essence of battling.\cI also have my quarters here, so feel\nfree to visit if you have time.
I'm your guide to the various facilities\nhere in the BATTLE FRONTIER.
Which would you like to learn about?
It is the gigantic tower considered\nto be the BATTLE FRONTIER's symbol.\cThere are four kinds of BATTLE ROOMS\nin the tower for SINGLE, DOUBLE, MULTI,\rand LINK MULTI BATTLES.
The BATTLE DOME is the large building\nshaped like a huge egg.\cEvents named Battle Tourneys are held\nin this facility.\cThe Battle Tourneys are offered in\ntwo courses--for SINGLE and DOUBLE\rBATTLES.
The BATTLE PALACE is the red building\non the right of the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cThere are two kinds of BATTLE HALLS\nfor SINGLE and DOUBLE BATTLES.
The BATTLE ARENA is the dojo-like\nbuilding at the center-right of\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\cAn event called the Set KO Tourney\ntakes place at the BATTLE ARENA.
The BATTLE FACTORY is the large\nbuilding that is the closest to us.\cAn event called the Battle Swap\nis conducted there.\cThe Battle Swap event is offered in\ntwo courses for SINGLE and DOUBLE\rBATTLES.
The BATTLE PIKE is the building shaped\nlike a POKéMON at the center-left of\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\cAn event called the Battle Choice\nis conducted there.
The BATTLE PYRAMID is the enormous\npyramid.\cAn event called the Battle Quest\nis conducted there.
The RANKING HALL is located near\nthe BATTLE TOWER.\cThere, you may see the most fantastic\nrecords left by the TRAINERS that\rtook on the many challenges of\rthe BATTLE FRONTIER.
The EXCHANGE SERVICE CORNER is near\nthe BATTLE TOWER.\cThe Battle Points you have earned in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER may be exchanged\rfor fabulous prizes there.
I'm your guide to the basic rules that\nare common to all the challenges\roffered by the facilities in the BATTLE\rFRONTIER.
What would you like to learn about?
All the challenges at the BATTLE\nFRONTIER's facilities come in\rtwo courses--Level 50 and Open Level.
The Level 50 course is open to POKéMON\nup to and including Level 50.\cPlease keep in mind, however, that\nno TRAINER you face will have any\rPOKéMON below Level 50.\cThis course is the entry level for\nbattles at the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cTo begin, we hope you will challenge\nthis course.
The Open Level course places no limit\non the levels of POKéMON entering\rchallenges.\cThe levels of your opponents will\nbe adjusted to match the levels of\ryour POKéMON.\cHowever, no TRAINER you face will\nhave any POKéMON below Level 60.
Virtually any kind of POKéMON may take\non the challenges at all facilities.\cEGGS and certain kinds of POKéMON,\nhowever, are not permitted.\cThe numbers of POKéMON required for\nchallenges will depend on the facility.\cAt all facilities, however, two or more\nof the same kind of POKéMON are not\rpermitted.
When entering a challenge at a BATTLE\nFRONTIER facility, POKéMON may not\rbe holding the same kind of item.\cPlease make sure that all POKéMON\nentering a challenge are holding\rdifferent items.
I'm your guide to the FRONTIER PASS.
Which would you like to learn about?
There are seven facilities at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\cTRAINERS who gain recognition for\ntheir abilities may be rewarded with\rsymbols from each of the facilities.\cTo earn a symbol, TRAINERS may need\nto defeat other TRAINERS in a row,\rand may need to win events repeatedly.\cIt's certainly not easy to win symbols.\nI wish you the best of luck!
It is possible to record one battle\non your FRONTIER PASS.\cYou may record a battle you had with\na friend or friends.\cOr you may record a battle conducted\nat the BATTLE FRONTIER excluding\rmatches at the BATTLE PIKE or\rthe BATTLE PYRAMID.\cYou may choose to record your match\nat the end of a battle.
Battle Points are rewards given to\nTRAINERS who battled outstandingly\rat the BATTLE FRONTIER.\cYou may trade in your Battle Points\nfor prizes at the EXCHANGE SERVICE\rCORNER.
What a TRAINER needs…\cKnowledge…\nStrategy…\rLuck…\rGuts…\rSpirit…\rBravery…\rAnd ability…\cWell, I'm all set in every way!\nI'll be unstoppable at every building!\cHuh? POKéMON?\nWhat's that?
Do you know about the FRONTIER\nBRAINS?\cThat's what SCOTT calls the seven\nspecial TRAINERS that run the seven\rfacilities in the BATTLE FRONTIER.
At the BATTLE TOWER, an older girl\ntold me that I have a lot of talent\rfor battling!\cI like POKéMON CONTESTS more!\cBut I'm no good at CONTESTS!\cI guess having talent and liking\nsomething aren't the same.
There was someone here using a \nPOKéMON I've never seen before.\cI never learned about it at\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL at least.\cI wonder where you can catch POKéMON\nlike that.
Okay! Next stop, the BATTLE ARENA!\nI'd better get the right POKéMON from\rthe PC Storage System.
Giggle… I'm going to go through every\nchallenge with just this baby!
SKITTY: Mya myaaah!
We came here to chaperon our\ngrandson.\cBut since we're here, we thought\nwe should get some souvenirs.
Dear, what do you think of this?\nWouldn't this make a nice gift?\cIt's…PRO…TE…IN?\nIt sounds delicious, doesn't it?
A lot of the BATTLE FRONTIER's\nfacilities don't allow the use of items\rduring battles.\cThat rule makes things tougher than\nthey already are!
The feeling of being watched faded…
This is the TRAINER HILL where\nyou may enjoy tag battles with many\rTRAINERS.\cUnfortunately, we're still getting\nthings ready. Please come back later!
Welcome!\cThis is the TRAINER HILL where\nyou may enjoy tag battles with many\rTRAINERS!

Would you like to challenge the\nwaiting TRAINERS?
I will time your progress.\nBest of luck!\cOn your marks…\cGet set…\cGo!
Please do visit us again!
That was too bad.\cI think you put in a tremendous\neffort in your battling.\cPlease come back and try again!
I hope you give it your best.
When the TRAINERS switch places,\nthe movement can be hectic.\cTo avoid the stampede, we moved\nthe reception counter here.\cI'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you for playing!
Here at the TRAINER HILL, we conduct\nan event called the Time Attack.\cIt is a race that measures how long\nyou take to reach our owner on\rthe rooftop from this counter.\cThe fastest times are posted on\nthe Time Board--try competing with\ryour friends.\cIn TRAINER battles along the way,\nneither Exp. Points nor money will\rbe awarded.
Oh, I'm sorry, but you appear to have\nonly one POKéMON with you.\cYou will need at least two POKéMON\nto enter this event.
Hm! Hm!\cYou finally came!\nYes, you have arrived!\cWait! Don't say it!\nI know why you came all the way\rhere by yourself!\cYou wanted to see me, the owner\nof the TRAINER HILL, because…\cYou want to form a tag team with me!\nWa-hoo!\c…Uh?\nThat's not it?\cAnyway, I watched you on your way up.\nMarvelous battling! Bravo, indeed!
For a marvelous someone like you,\nI have the most marvelous gift!
Oh, no, full up with things!\nYou'll be back later for this!
Oh, hold on here! Did you possibly get\nhere marvelously quickly?\cHow splendid! You needn't have\nhurried so to see me!\cThat is so delightful. I'll have the Time\nBoard at the reception updated!
But, oh…\nYou weren't very quick getting here.
Perhaps it would please me more if you\narrived zippier next time.\cThen, I should be pleased to form\na tag team with you!\cUntil we meet again, amigo!
I had the TRAINER HILL built for but\none reason and one only!\cTo find the most suitable partner\nwith whom I may form a tag team!
[STR_VAR_1] min. [STR_VAR_2].[STR_VAR_3] sec.
Who knows what sort of TRAINERS\nand POKéMON combos are ahead?\cAll I know is that I'll knock aside\nanyone that stands in my way!
I heard tough TRAINERS come to this\nTRAINER HILL from all over.\cI can't wait to test the waters!\cI'll knock aside anyone that stands\nin my way!
Do you see the Time Board over there?\cMy friends and I are trying to see who\ncan reach the top in the least time.
Do you know when they're opening\nthis place up?\cI'm waiting here to be the first\nchallenger ever!
Would you like to return to\nthe reception counter?
I'm the owner of the SEASHORE HOUSE.\nBut you can call me MR. SEA!\cWhat I love above all is to see hot\nPOKéMON battles.\cLet me see that your heart burns hot!\cIf you can defeat all the TRAINERS\nhere, I'll reward your efforts.
Show me some hot matches!\cI run this SEASHORE HOUSE just for\nthat reason alone!
You're scorching hot!\nThose battles blazed!\rI'm more than just satisfied!\cAs thanks for showing me your hot\nstreak, I want you to take these.\cIt's half a dozen bottles of SODA POP!
Oh, but hey, your BAG's jammed full.\nI'll hang on to these for you.
Want to buy some SODA POP?\nPOKéMON love it!\cJust $300 a bottle!\nBuy some!
Here you go!
You don't have the money.
No?\nThat's too bad.
If you're looking for a battle in the\nSEASHORE HOUSE, you'll find no\rhotter TRAINER than me, matey!
That was a hot battle!\nI can accept that loss, matey!
Whenever I'm in SLATEPORT, I enjoy\nhot battles and ice-cold SODA POP!
Boring battles aren't worth the effort.\cFiery hot battles are what toughen up\nTRAINERS and POKéMON!
That's hot!
Whew, I'm all thirsty.\nMaybe I'll have a SODA POP.
I'm going to show you how great\nmy POKéMON are, but don't cry!
…I lost, but I won't cry…
If one of my POKéMON knew the move\nfor carrying me across water on its\rback, I could get rid of this inner tube.
You're being watched…
Hah? Grrr…\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nbeneath this desk? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr…\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nbehind this tree? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr…\cHow did you know I concealed myself\nin this dresser? You're sharp!

Behold!\cFor I am the greatest living mystery\nof a man in all of HOENN!\rThey call me…\cThe TRICK MASTER!\nWahahaha! Glad to meet you!
You, you've come to challenge\nmy TRICK HOUSE, haven't you?\cThat's why you're here, isn't it?\nYes, it is!\cConsider your challenge accepted!\cEnter through the scroll there,\nand let your challenge commence!\cI shall be waiting in the back!
It's a scroll.
There is a big hole behind the scroll!\cWant to go in?
There is a note affixed to the scroll…\c“I am leaving on a journey.\nDon't look for me. TRICK MASTER”
For the next time, I'll use this trick,\nand that scheme, and those ruses…\cMufufufu… If I may say so, it's\nbrilliantly difficult, even for me!
Hah? What?!\nOh, it's you!\cI'm in the midst of devising new tricky\nchallenges!\cIt's not too much to ask for a bit more\ntime for me to think, is it now?\rYou wouldn't begrudge me that?\rCome back in a little while!
Ah, it's you! You're here to accept the\nreward from before, isn't that right?\rYes, right I am!\cHere!\nI'll give it to you now!
Hah?\nDid you not come to claim your reward?
MECHADOLL 5 I AM!\nIF REWARD IS NOT TAKEN BY YOU,\rTHEN TRICK MASTER YOU CANNOT FOLLOW.\cRED TENT OR BLUE TENT,\nWHICH DO YOU PREFER?
THEN FAREWELL.
YOUR PC STATUS: FULL AGAIN.\nMEAN, YOU ARE.
[PLAYER] found a scroll.
[PLAYER] memorized the secret code\nwritten on the scroll.
A secret code is written on it.
The door is locked.\c…On closer inspection, this is written\non it: “Write the secret code here.”
Aak!\nYou've made it to me?\rHmmm… You're sharp!
It took me all night to plant all those\ntrees…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four, five, six places!
It took me all night to make the maze…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four, five places!
It took me all night to prepare\nthe wall panels…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three, four places!
It took me all night to shove in those\nboulders…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two, three places!
It took me all night to make MECHADOLLS\nand another to think up the quiz…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness by\none, two places!
It took me all night to install\nthe doors…\cYou're almost my equal in greatness!
It took me all night setting up arrows…\cYou're my equal in greatness!
It took me all night polishing floors…\cYou're above me in greatness!\nPossibly…
Wh-what should I do?\nMy fountain of ideas for tricks has\rrun dry…\cPerhaps it is time I toured the country\non a quest to devise new tricks…
I hate to admit defeat, but you have\nbested me!\cStill, you must have been reeled in by\nmy charisma for you to visit me again\rand again. Yes, you must have!\cBut that has nothing to do with my\nlosing!\cIn recognition of the friendship\nbetween you, the driven, and the genius\rthat is myself, I demand that you take\rthis keepsake!\cActually there are two--\na RED TENT and a BLUE TENT.\rWhich do you prefer?
What? No room in your PC?\nWhat am I to make of that?\cI wish I could say that, but I am much\ntoo kind and caring, so come back later!
… … … … … …\cI am leaving on a journey of discovery.\nA quest in search of new tricks.\cI wish that you will one day visit and\nentertain me again.\cAnd now, farewell!
Fine!\nYou have earned this reward!
What? Have you no room for this?\nWhat manner of items do you carry?\cBut fine, since you've reached me,\nyour reward will be with me till later.
Scrub that smug smirk from your face!\nIt's much too early to think you've won!\cI'll make new tricks to stump you, I will.\nYou may mock me only when you're done.\cCome back for the next exciting\ninstallment!
Now, now! You're ignoring me now?\nNow that, I consider heartbreaking!
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is fabulous.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
I'll hack and slash my way to victory\nwith the CUT we just learned!
Why are you so serious?
I never get tired of hacking\nand slashing!
I wandered into this weird house\nby accident…
And now I've lost…
I lost my way, I lost a battle, and I'm\nnow even more lost… I can't get out…
Just who is the TRICK MASTER?
I lost while I was lost in thought!
You're strong!\nJust who are you?
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is smart.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
Which switch closes which hole?
After that battle, I'm even more\nconfused!
Can I get you to push all the buttons\nfor me?
Oh! You're on your second TRICK HOUSE\nchallenge!
You're good at battling too?
The TRICK MASTER rigged all the tricks\nin this house all by himself.
I want to make my own GYM one day.\nSo, I'm studying how to set traps.
I didn't study battling enough!
You're strong, aren't you?\nMaybe even enough to be a GYM LEADER!
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is coveted.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
I keep coming back to this same place!
I'm already having trouble, and then\nyou have to beat me? It's not fair!
It's full of doors here!\nIt's too small and dark in here! Help!
I don't know what's going on here.\nI'm starting to feel sad…
You… You're awful!
I know I'm weak!\nAnd, I have no sense of direction!
I don't get it. What would anyone want\nwith a house this bizarre?
I don't get it.\nHow did I lose?
I don't get it.\nHow many traps are in this house?\cYou may be the one to solve that.
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is cool.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
It's too much bother to think this out.\nI only wanted to battle!
Even though I lost, I still like battling\nthe best!
Wouldn't you agree? You would go\nanywhere if TRAINERS were there.
Heh! Boulders like this, I can brush\naside with one finger!
I can push boulders, but I can't solve\nthe puzzle…
It's not good enough to be brawny…\nYou have to use your head. Be brainy!
The TRICK HOUSE is getting trickier,\nisn't it?
Aaak!
Has anyone made it to the end?
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is a genius.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!

When I heard there was a strange\nhouse, I had to check it out.
I've discovered a tough TRAINER!
I'm sure having a good time checking\nthis place out.\cIt's a challenge I've found worth\nrepeating!
Maybe I could get my BIRD POKéMON\nto fly over the wall…
Gwaaah! I blew it!
Ehehehe… I guess I lost because\nI was trying to cheat.
I'm getting dizzy from these rotating\ndoors…
Everything's spinning around and\naround. I can't take this anymore…
You don't seem to be affected at all.\nOr do you have your poker face on?
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER is huggable.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
The TRICK MASTER always vanishes\nlike smoke. How does he do it?
Aiyeeeh! You're much too strong!\nHow do you do it?
I wish I could appear and disappear as\nif I were smoke, too.
Going around the same spot…\nIt begets ill fortune…
Defeated!\nIt's a bad sign…
I've circled the same spot over ten\ntimes now… It's ill fortune…
Whoever wins will get through here\nfirst. That's the feeling I get.
Oh!\nWell, go ahead, then!
You're solving all the puzzles in the\nTRICK HOUSE. That's the feeling I get.
Nufufufu, here at last!\nLet's get right with it!
You're so casual about winning!
Humph! I'm not upset!\nNot me!
I ever so closely watched you coming!
This outcome I didn't see coming…
Well, anyway, we both picked a weird\nplace to get acquainted.\cAs one weirdo to another,\nlet's do our best!
It's awfully cramped in here…
Oh, yes, strong you are.
I was hoping to switch places with you\nwhen I beat you, but…
[PLAYER] wrote down the secret code\non the door.\c“TRICK MASTER I love.”\n… … … … … … … …\cThe lock clicked open!
Not many TRAINERS have made it\nthis far.
That must mean you're tough, too…
You've beaten the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION? That's too much!
Consider yourself lucky to be\nbattling me!
This isn't right!\nI can't lose!
It's a miracle that you beat me.\nYou can brag about it.
You've been slugging through the TRICK\nHOUSE challenge, too.
I see…\nYou possess an extraordinary style.
Seeing someone like you should please\nthe TRICK MASTER.
On CYCLING ROAD, you can go all out\nand cycle as fast as you'd like.\cIt feels great to go that fast, but try\nnot to crash into anyone!
Sorry, you can't walk on CYCLING\nROAD. It's too dangerous.\cPlease come back with a BIKE.

This area is covered in volcanic ash,\nhuff-puff!\cI'm specially gifted, huff-puff.\cI make glass out of volcanic ash\nand make items, huff-puff.\cGo collect ashes with this, huff-puff.
Just take that SOOT SACK and walk\nthrough piles of ash, huff-puff.\cAnd it will fill up with the volcanic ash,\nhuff-puff.\cOnce you think you've collected a good\namount, come see me, huff-puff.
Have you collected ashes, huff-puff?\nLet me see, huff-puff.
Hmmm…\nThere's not enough ash here, huff-puff.\rI can't make glass with this, huff-puff.\cLet's see… [STR_VAR_1] is the number of steps\nyou'll need to walk for me to make you\ra BLUE FLUTE, huff-puff.
Oh!\nYou've got a lot of ashes, huff-puff!\cI'll make you a glass item, huff-puff!\nWhich one would you like, huff-puff?
A [STR_VAR_1], huff-puff?\nIs that the one for you, huff-puff?
Which one would you like, huff-puff?
A [STR_VAR_1] it is, then, huff-puff!\cOkay! I'll make it for you, huff-puff.\nJust wait a little while, huff-puff.
A [STR_VAR_1], huff-puff?\cThere's not enough ash here to make\nthat, though, huff-puff.\cLet's see… [STR_VAR_2] is the number of steps\nyou'll need to walk through volcanic ash\rfor me to make that item, huff-puff.\cWhich item would you rather have me\nmake instead, huff-puff?
You've collected all that ash, but you\ndon't want anything, huff-puff?
Ah, I've finished your [STR_VAR_1].\nTake it, huff-puff.
Oh?\nYou've no room in your BAG, huff-puff.\cI'll hold on to it, so come back later,\nhuff-puff.
Oh?\nYou've no room in your PC, huff-puff?\cI'll hold on to it, so come back later,\nhuff-puff.
Hah? You haven't got your SOOT SACK\nwith you, huff-puff.\cYou have to keep it with you to collect\nvolcanic ash, huff-puff.
It's fun to blow a glass flute while\nmy boss is talking.\cHuff-huff! Puff-puff!
The BOSS got interested in\nthe research they have going here,\rso he sent us out.\cYou quit meddling!
Blast it…\nBlasted by a kid…
Our BOSS knows everything.\cBut I'm just a GRUNT. What would I know\nabout what he's thinking?
Huh?\nWhat's a kid doing here?
Huh?\nI lost?!
Oh, no…\nI'll catch an earful for losing to a kid…\cI should just take a nap in the bed…
While I was sleeping, everyone went\nupstairs!
Wow, you're really strong!\cI wish I could be a POKéMON TRAINER\nlike you!
The PROFESSOR loves rain.\nThat's a fact.\cBut if it keeps raining, people will be in\ntrouble. That's another fact.\cAnd thus, the PROFESSOR is studying\nif the rain can be put to good use.
On the 2nd floor of the INSTITUTE,\nwe study the weather patterns over\rthe HOENN region.\cWe've been noticing temporary and\nisolated cases of droughts and\rheavy rain lately…
Hello!\nWe've been saved by your actions!\cWhat I don't understand is what on\nearth the AQUAS were up to.
There's a bed…\nLet's take a rest.
The INSTITUTE created a type of\nPOKéMON that has something to do with\rthe weather. We're here to take them!
Our plan's being spoiled by a kid?
If the POKéMON they made here can\ncontrol the weather freely, then we of\rTEAM AQUA definitely need it!
We're TEAM AQUA!\nWe appear wherever anything rare is\rfound!
You got me!
You don't have any idea what we of\nTEAM AQUA are working towards!\rYou stay out of our way!
Don't tell me you're looking for that\nweather POKéMON, too?\cThat's a no-no!\nWe were here to get it first!
Oh, will you look at my POKéMON?
Humph, so what?\nWhat we want…\cWhat we really want isn't here…\nIhihihihi…
Ahahahaha!\cYou're going to meddle in TEAM AQUA's\naffairs?\cYou're either absolutely fearless,\nsimply ignorant, or both!\cYou're so cute, you're disgusting!\nI'll put you down, kiddy!
Ahahahaha!\nYou're disgustingly strong!
It's bad enough to have TEAM MAGMA\nblunder about, but now there's you!\cWhat makes you want to sniff around\nin our business, anyway?
We have a situation here!\cA TEAM MAGMA mob just passed\nthe WEATHER INSTITUTE.\cThey appear to be headed for\nMT. PYRE!
What?!\cWe can't waste any more time here!\nWe have to hurry to MT. PYRE, too!\cAhahahaha!\nTEAM MAGMA, just you wait!
Thanks!\nThanks to you, we're safe!\cIt might be an odd way of thanking you,\nbut take this POKéMON.
Hm? You don't seem to have any room\nfor this POKéMON.
[PLAYER] received CASTFORM!
That POKéMON changes shape according\nto the weather conditions.\cThere're plenty of them in the\nINSTITUTE--go ahead and take it.
I've been researching rain for many\nyears, but it's ridiculous to think that\rhumans can freely change the weather.
I track weather patterns over\nthe HOENN region.\cPresently, a drought has been recorded\nin [STR_VAR_1].\cCould that mean, somewhere near\n[STR_VAR_1]…
I track weather patterns over\nthe HOENN region.\cPresently, heavy rainfall has been\nrecorded over [STR_VAR_1].\cCould that mean, somewhere near\n[STR_VAR_1]…
Abnormal weather conditions are\nno longer being reported.\cThe occasional rainfall is a blessing,\nreally.
I heard about a cave called the CAVE\nOF ORIGIN.\cPeople rumor that the spirits of\nPOKéMON are revived there. Could\rsomething like that really happen?
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
I'm the DIVING TREASURE HUNTER!\cI'm the awesome dude who makes\ndeep-sea dives to gather treasures\rresting at the bottom.
Tell me, have you seen any SHARDS of\ntools made in ancient times?
You haven't got any treasures\nfor me…\cIf you see any SHARDS, like the RED\nSHARD, you've got to trade it with me!
Oh, hey! That…\nThat's a SHARD! I'm looking for those!\cOh, man, you've got to trade that\nwith me! I'll give you something good!
What do you want to trade?
You'll trade your [STR_VAR_1] for\nmy [STR_VAR_2], then?
It's a done deal!\nUse that wisely!
Do you want to trade something else?
Whoops, your BAG's full.\nGet rid of some items, friend!

Oh, you will?\nThank you.\cBriefly, how would you describe the\nCONTEST you just entered?
Ah, I see.\nThat's a very edifying comment.\cYou get a good feel for what\nthe CONTEST was like.\cI've got one last question.\cWhen you hear the word “[STR_VAR_2],”\nwhat image do you get?
I see!\cSo that's how you imagine the concept\nof “[STR_VAR_2]” to be.\cThank you!\nYou've given me some good ideas.\cI think I can write a good story on\nPOKéMON CONTESTS now.\cMaybe, just maybe, this story will even\nmake it to television.\rI hope you'll look forward to it!
Oh, too bad…\cWell, if you come across a good story,\nplease do share it with me.
I'll be looking forward to your next\nPOKéMON CONTEST.
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\cToday, we're going to profile a POKéMON\nbelonging to [STR_VAR_1].\cNow, this POKéMON boasts a [STR_VAR_3]\nRank in the [STR_VAR_2] Category.
Introducing [STR_VAR_2] the\n[STR_VAR_1]!\cThe nickname [STR_VAR_2]…\cEven the nickname exudes an air that\nproclaims “[STR_VAR_3]”!
Anyway, when the TRAINER [STR_VAR_1]\nentered the POKéMON in a CONTEST,\rwe managed to get a few impassioned\rquotes about the trusty partner.
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n[STR_VAR_1] happily replied with a huge\rgrin, “[STR_VAR_2]!”\cWell, sure, [STR_VAR_1]'s POKéMON came in\nnumber [STR_VAR_3] in the CONTEST.\cThat line perfectly suits [STR_VAR_1]\nright now, I'd say!
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n[STR_VAR_1] replied with a tinge of\rbitterness, “[STR_VAR_2].”\cWell, sure, [STR_VAR_1]'s POKéMON came in\nnumber [STR_VAR_3] in the CONTEST.\c[STR_VAR_1]'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!
Wouldn't you also like to know what\n[STR_VAR_1] imagines [STR_VAR_2] to be?\cYou bet we did!\nSo we asked, of course!\cThe answer is all perfectly condensed:\n“[STR_VAR_3]!”\cThat's what the concept of [STR_VAR_2]\nrepresents to [STR_VAR_1]!
The last move [STR_VAR_2] used by\nthe [STR_VAR_1] is entirely about\r“[STR_VAR_3]”!
Bravo, [STR_VAR_1]!\nBravo, [STR_VAR_2]!\cI hope we can count on seeing\n[STR_VAR_1] scale even greater heights!\cThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!
Introducing the TRAINER's [STR_VAR_1]!
Hello! You're the TRAINER who just had\na battle, right?\cI'm gathering interviews with TRAINERS\nall over the place.\cMay I get a few words from you about\nyour impressions on battling?
You will? Really?\nThank you!\rThen, uh…\cHow did things turn out in\nthe BATTLE TOWER today?\cWere you satisfied with the battle?\nOr are you unhappy?
Oh…\nSorry we disturbed you.\cPlease give us an interview the next\ntime you visit the BATTLE TOWER.
Well, of course!\cThat unmistakable look of satisfaction\non your face…\cIt's obvious that you've had a great\nbattle.
Oh, I see…\cWell, it certainly is difficult to make a\nbattle turn out exactly as planned.
Oh, oh, may I ask one more question?\cIf you were to describe your\nimpressions about this battle with\rone saying, what would it be?
Oh, that is stunningly cool!\cThat's a great line!\nI hope you'll do great next time, too.\cI hope to see you again!
Oh, I see…\cStill, being the silent type is also\ncool, isn't it?\cI hope you'll give me the opportunity\nto share your thoughts again!
I'll be looking forward to your\nnext battle!
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\cToday, we're going to profile [STR_VAR_1],\nwho took the BATTLE TOWER challenge!\cFor the challenge, [STR_VAR_1] entered\none wicked [STR_VAR_2].
The pair set a new record of [STR_VAR_2] wins\nin a row in [STR_VAR_1] competition!\rBravo, TRAINER!
The twosome finally succumbed to\n[STR_VAR_1] in match number [STR_VAR_2].\rNice try, TRAINER!\cBut, hey, it's just bad luck to run into\n[STR_VAR_1] so early in the challenge.\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the match with [STR_VAR_1].
The twosome won it all by defeating\n[STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2] thoroughly.\rBravo, TRAINER!\cKnocking off even [STR_VAR_1]…\nIt defies belief! Simply astounding!\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the moment of glory.
After a string of wins, the pair finally\nsuccumbed to [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2],\rtheir final hurdle.\cNice try, TRAINER!\cStill, you have to give credit.\nYou don't see many famous combinations\rlike [STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2].\cWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non battling the celebrity pair.
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm satisfied!”\cNow isn't that a refreshing reply?\nBravo, TRAINER!\cIsn't it out-and-out awesome to be\nable to battle to full satisfaction?\cI found out exactly how satisfied\nwhen I heard the TRAINER say this:
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm not satisfied…”\cOur TRAINER was obviously a little down\nwhen that was uttered.\cStill, it's not easy to be able to battle\nwith complete satisfaction, am I right?\cAnyway, I found out how dissatisfied\nour TRAINER was when I heard this:
None
None
None
None
“[STR_VAR_1].”
“[STR_VAR_1].”\nNow isn't that great?\cIt really expresses [STR_VAR_2]'s joy,\nI'd say.\cThat battle with [STR_VAR_3] at the\nend… It really was what you'd call\r“[STR_VAR_1]”!
“[STR_VAR_1].”\nNow isn't that fitting?\cThat battle with [STR_VAR_3] at the\nend… You can't describe it as anything\relse but “[STR_VAR_1]”!\c[STR_VAR_2]'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!
Bravo, [STR_VAR_1]!\nBravo, [STR_VAR_2]!\cI hope we can count on seeing\n[STR_VAR_1] scale even greater heights!\cThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!
Wow!\cIt's plain to see that you lavish your\nlove on your [STR_VAR_1].\cOkay, it's named [STR_VAR_2].\cCan I ask you a favor?\cI'm a TV reporter, and I'm running\na survey on POKéMON.\cWould you be willing to answer a few\nsimple questions for me?

Hello, it's time for RECENT HAPPENINGS.\cFor POKéMON TRAINERS, every day\nis a storybook tale.\cWhat we want to do is to introduce you\nto some of these POKéMON tales.\cToday, we bring you the story\nof the TRAINER [STR_VAR_1].\cWhat did [STR_VAR_1] experience recently?\nLet's find out.\cLet's see…
Wasn't that enlightening?\cThe story gives you a clear idea of what\n[STR_VAR_1] has experienced recently.\rIt's as if we were there as witnesses!
“[STR_VAR_3].” That\naccents the tale and gives it depth.
“[STR_VAR_3].”\nThat gives the tale a sense of place.\rIt lets us envision the tale's setting.
The “[STR_VAR_3]”\nsection of the tale is very expressive.
[STR_VAR_1] has recounted a wonderful\ntale involving POKéMON.\cAnd now [STR_VAR_1]'s tale is indelibly\netched into your soul, too.\cThat's it for today.\nPlease tune in next time.
Greetings!\nIt's time for POKéMON NEWS.\cWe've just received word of a very\nrare occurrence.\cThere have been reports of a mass\noutbreak of [STR_VAR_2] in the vicinity\rof [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_2], as you're probably aware,\nis known as a POKéMON that's rare\rand hard to find.\cIt sounds like a rare opportunity to\nsee the mystifying outbreak of\r[STR_VAR_2] in the wild.\cThat's the news on POKéMON NEWS.
MC: We hope you're in good cheer,\n“3 CHEERS FOR [POKEBLOCK]S” is here!\cToday, we examine the [POKEBLOCK] blended\nby [STR_VAR_1] and associates.\cWithout any delay, let me feed it\nto my gourmet POKéMON GULPIN.\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …
GULPIN: Gubi! Gubii!\cMC: And the verdict is very [STR_VAR_1]!\nGULPIN says it tastes “[STR_VAR_2]!”\cThank you so much, [STR_VAR_3]!
[STR_VAR_1]'s blending performance\nleft something to be desired.\cIf this TRAINER could blend better,\nthe [POKEBLOCK] would be much tastier.
GULPIN: Gubi! Gubii!\cMC: Hmm… It's too [STR_VAR_1].\nGULPIN says it tastes “[STR_VAR_2]!”\cIt looks like [STR_VAR_3]'s errors\nhurt the blending quality…
It's too bad that [STR_VAR_1]'s\nleading effort went to waste.\cLet's hope [STR_VAR_2] can turn in\na better showing next time!
Tune in next time!\nOur slogan is “3 CHEERS FOR [POKEBLOCK]S!”

Have you completely forgotten\nabout [STR_VAR_1]?
I'm a big fan of [STR_VAR_1].\nWhat's your opinion of [STR_VAR_1]?

Have you completely forgotten\nabout [STR_VAR_1]?
Oh, I see!\nYou should meet [STR_VAR_1] sometime.\rI'm sure you'll become a fan, too!
I see, I see.\cThank you!\nThat's very useful to know.\cI'll share this information with other\n[STR_VAR_1] fans and discuss it.
There's going to be a TV special on\n[STR_VAR_1] very soon.\cI hope you catch it!
TRAINER FAN CLUB\n[STR_VAR_1] SPECIAL!\cThis is a special presentation for\nthe fans of [STR_VAR_1] all over HOENN!\cToday, we ask the question, “What do\npeople think of [STR_VAR_1]?”\cWe posed the question to [STR_VAR_2]\nas the TRAINER representative.\cWe asked, “In one word, how would\nyou describe [STR_VAR_1]?”\cThe reply: “[STR_VAR_3].”\cKudos to [STR_VAR_2]!\nWhat a perceptive opinion!\c“[STR_VAR_3] [STR_VAR_1].”\nIt has such a nice ring to it!\c[STR_VAR_2] also scored [STR_VAR_1]'s\nstrength from 0 to 100.
The score was [STR_VAR_3] points!\nThat is a very high score indeed!\c[STR_VAR_2] must obviously hold\n[STR_VAR_1] in very high esteem.
The score was [STR_VAR_3] points!\nThat is quite a good score.\c[STR_VAR_2] must consider\n[STR_VAR_1] to be a rival.
The score was [STR_VAR_3] points!\nThat's a rather weak score.\c[STR_VAR_2] must consider\n[STR_VAR_1] to be a mere sidekick.
The score was [STR_VAR_3] point(s)!\nThat's a terrible score.\c[STR_VAR_2] must consider\n[STR_VAR_1] to be an underling.
There you have it, folks!\cI think we all learned something\nnew about [STR_VAR_1].\cIn closing, I'll leave you with\n[STR_VAR_2]'s words.\c[STR_VAR_3] [STR_VAR_1]!
And now, it's time for…\nTHE NAME RATER SHOW.\cI tell your POKéMON's fortune from\nthe nickname you've bestowed.\cAdvice is what I have to give, and it is\nhelpful advice that I offer.\cToday, I shall do a reading of\nthe nickname [STR_VAR_3] of [STR_VAR_1]'s\rPOKéMON [STR_VAR_2].\cHmhm…\cHmm…\nThis nickname is…
A nickname that hints at talent in many\ndifferent ways.\cI urge this TRAINER to take courage\nand take on many challenges.
A nickname that perfectly complements\n[STR_VAR_1], the TRAINER's name.\cIt suggests that you will forge a fine\npartnership with precise timing.
A nickname fit for a unique individual\nof a POKéMON!\cIf raised properly, this POKéMON's\nuniqueness will bloom excessively!
A nickname that will nurture the caring\nand compassionate side of POKéMON.\cIf raised properly, this POKéMON will\ncome to exhibit real warmth!
A very fine nickname that hints at\ngreatness to come.\cI am intrigued about what the future\nholds in store for this POKéMON.
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON hale and hearty!\cThat POKéMON should remain fit and\nrobust for a long, long time.
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON very active!\cI should think that this POKéMON will be\na strong performer in battles.
An appealing nickname that should make\nthe POKéMON very charming!\cI don't doubt that this POKéMON will be\nquite the charmer in POKéMON CONTESTS.
The nickname [STR_VAR_1] is rooted by\nthe letter “[STR_VAR_3].”\cThat letter is supported by the first\nletter “[STR_VAR_2],” which gives it a solid sense\rof presence as a nickname.
The nickname [STR_VAR_1] is very\nshapely in a pleasing manner.\cThe presence of the letters “[STR_VAR_2]” and\n“[STR_VAR_3]”--now that is remarkably good!
The nickname [STR_VAR_1]--it has a\nsublime, flowing feel to it.\cThe flow from the initial letter “[STR_VAR_2]” to\n“[STR_VAR_3]” is especially wonderful.
Let's examine other examples of fine\nnicknames, shall we?
Try this example. Take a part of the\nTRAINER name of [STR_VAR_1], and end\rup with the fine nickname [STR_VAR_2][STR_VAR_3].
The nickname [STR_VAR_2][STR_VAR_3] would also work\nquite well.
The POKéMON's species name of\n[STR_VAR_2] could be used as the basis\rfor making the nickname [STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3].
[STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3] would also be an effective\nnickname.
What should always be avoided is using\nanother POKéMON species name.\cFor instance, avoid taking the name of\n[STR_VAR_2] to make the nickname [STR_VAR_1][STR_VAR_3].\rThat is unacceptable.
I must say that [STR_VAR_1] is quite\na good nickname.\cI hope that the TRAINER will continue\nto treat [STR_VAR_1] with love.\cThat's it for today's show.\nMay we meet again.

Oh!\nSpeaking of [STR_VAR_1]…\cBIG SIS, I saw the TRAINER with my very\nown eyes!\cBIG SIS: Oh, what did you see?\cBIG BRO: Well, I had to go on a trip to\n[STR_VAR_2].\cThat's when I happened to come across\n[STR_VAR_1], who was trying to catch the\rPOKéMON [STR_VAR_3], but…
The POKéMON managed to get away!\cIt ended up wasting this many\nPOKé BALLS: [STR_VAR_2]!\cYou should have seen the expression\nof frustration on [STR_VAR_1]'s face when\rthe POKéMON took off!

BIG SIS: [STR_VAR_1] gave the nickname\n[STR_VAR_3] to the [STR_VAR_2]!\cIt sounds like [STR_VAR_3] is getting\ngood, loving care!
BIG BRO: The TRAINER had to throw this\nmany POKé BALLS to catch it: [STR_VAR_3]!\cIt finally took a single [STR_VAR_2]\nto catch it!
BIG SIS: If it was that easy to catch,\nit must have been destiny that brought\r[STR_VAR_1] and the [STR_VAR_2] together!
BIG SIS: Wow! That's so neat!\cBut you know what they say, a POKéMON\nthat takes a lot of effort to catch\rearns the love of its TRAINER!

BIG BRO: Then to give the nickname\n[STR_VAR_3] to that [STR_VAR_2]…\cYou really get a good idea about\n[STR_VAR_1]'s TRAINER sense.\cBIG SIS: I second that notion!
If it were me, I'd give that nickname\nto something like this [STR_VAR_3]!\cBIG BRO: Whoa! That could be the start\nof something new!
[STR_VAR_2] the [STR_VAR_1]?\nDoesn't that sound perfect?\cThe letters and everything--they\nsound just right for the POKéMON\r[STR_VAR_1]!\cBIG BRO: Yeah, true, that!
As far as I know, no TRAINER has ever\ngiven the nickname [STR_VAR_2] to their\r[STR_VAR_1]!\cBIG BRO: That just goes to show what\ngreat taste the TRAINER has in picking\rnicknames!
The next time I catch a POKéMON,\nI should give it the name [STR_VAR_2].\cBIG BRO: Huh? Me, too!\nI'll use the nickname [STR_VAR_2], too!
BIG SIS: Oh, no!\nLook at the time!\cWell, gang, this is it for today.\nSee you again next time!\cBIG BRO: Remember, it could be your\nPOKéMON in the spotlight next time!

THE WORLD OF MASTERS\cHello, viewers.\cPerhaps you are aware of a TRAINER\nnamed [STR_VAR_1].\c[STR_VAR_1] is famous as a master at\ncatching POKéMON.\c[STR_VAR_1]'s quest for POKéMON depends\nentirely on a careful search on foot.\cOn one memorable day, the TRAINER\nwalked some [STR_VAR_2] steps.\cThe total number of POKéMON caught\nthat day reached an impressive [STR_VAR_3]!
That remarkable feat must have been\npossible because of the trust between\rthe TRAINER and [STR_VAR_1].
The master caught the day's last\n[STR_VAR_3] near [STR_VAR_2].\cThat POKéMON apparently enjoys\na special status as a record holder.\cSkilled TRAINERS should be encouraged\nto challenge this fine record.\cThat's all for today.\nPlease tune in next time.

In just one day, [STR_VAR_1] obtained\n[STR_VAR_2] Battle Points!\c[STR_VAR_1] was later seen wrestling\nwith the choice of exchanging\rthe Battle Points for a cool item or\ra nifty interior decoration.\cThe TRAINER reportedly was grinning\nwhile mulling options.

And now, what will [STR_VAR_2] do?
In the end, [STR_VAR_2] took [STR_VAR_3] steps\nin [STR_VAR_1]'s SECRET BASE before\rleaving.

Spectator: The [STR_VAR_2] was tops in\nboth primary and secondary judging!\cThat [STR_VAR_2] will keep winning!
Spectator: The [STR_VAR_2] didn't do\nwell in the primary judging, but it\rcleaned up in the secondary judging!\cIt was a miraculous comeback\nfor that [STR_VAR_2]. Yippee!
Spectator: The [STR_VAR_2] remained\nconsistent throughout both primary\rand secondary judging.\c[STR_VAR_3] and the [STR_VAR_2],\nthey're no ordinary combo!
Spectator: In terms of being [STR_VAR_1],\nthat [STR_VAR_2] was outstanding.\cI hope it makes better appeals\nnext time, though.
Spectator: When the [STR_VAR_2] got\nnervous, I couldn't stop myself from\rshouting encouragement.\cI'd like to say this to that\n[STR_VAR_2], “Congratulations!”
Spectator: That [STR_VAR_2]'s appeal\nstartled even me!\c[STR_VAR_2], you were awesome!
Spectator: That [STR_VAR_2]'s combo\nappeal was stunning!\cIt's shaken me to the core!
Spectator: The winning [STR_VAR_2]'s\nappeal got my heart pounding!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou were cool!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou were beautiful!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou were cute!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou were smart!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou were tough!
Spectator: The winning [STR_VAR_2]'s\nappeal still has my heart pounding!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou're the last word in cool!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou're the most beautiful!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou're simply the cutest!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou're the smartest among the smart!
[STR_VAR_2]!\nYou're the toughest of the tough!
Spectator: Even when the [STR_VAR_2]\ntook a break from making appeals,\rI couldn't take my eyes off it.\cI'm captivated by that [STR_VAR_2].
Spectator: When the [STR_VAR_2] was\nstartled by another POKéMON's appeal,\rI was close to tears.\c[STR_VAR_2], you were resilient!\nWay to go!
Spectator: Oh…\nThat [STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]!\r[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]!\r[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]!\rHow could it be so wonderful?
MC: Well, there you have it. This place\nis full of the [STR_VAR_1]'s fans!\cI should also mention that another\nPOKéMON, [STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3], \rcaught my eye.\c[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3]…
It failed to make a single appeal during\nsecondary judging out of nervousness.\cNext time, I would like to see this\n[STR_VAR_1] make even one appeal.
It came dead last in both primary\nand secondary judging.\cI hope that [STR_VAR_1] will retrain this\n[STR_VAR_2] and erase the shame of\rthis undisputed last-place finish.
It failed to take advantage of\nthe audience's excitement and make\ran appropriate appeal.\cWe hope [STR_VAR_1] will learn how to get\na feel for the audience and whip their\rexcitement to a fever pitch next time.
While finishing first in the primary\njudging, its appeals in the secondary\rjudging failed to click.\cIt suffered a humiliating come-from-\nbehind loss.\cI'm sure [STR_VAR_1] is studying how to\nmake more effective appeals now.
The audience never got excited by its\nappeals during the secondary judging.\cWe hope it will stop worrying about\nother POKéMON and learn to pitch\rits appeals to the audience more.
It lost to [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2]\nby only a small margin.\cIt must be heartbreaking to come\nso close to victory only to fail.\cI wouldn't be surprised if [STR_VAR_3]\nwere weeping over this outcome.
It disappointed the JUDGE by\nrepeating the same appeals.\cIt's an unforgivable error in any\nCONTEST, and the POKéMON paid.\c[STR_VAR_1] should feel guilty for\nthis sorry showing.
[STR_VAR_1] turned in a valiant effort,\nbut…\cIt was all for naught, finishing last.\c[STR_VAR_1] should learn from this loss\nand put the knowledge to good use.
I'd like to end this program with our\nusual farewell to the winners.\cThis time, it's [STR_VAR_1] and\nthe [STR_VAR_2]!\cMC: Is everyone ready?\nAll together now!\cAudience: [STR_VAR_1]! [STR_VAR_2]!\nCongratulations!\rYou're the CONTEST winner!

GABBY: Oh! We've just spotted a tough-\nlooking TRAINER here of all places!\cOkay, roll camera!\nLet's get this interview.

GABBY: “[STR_VAR_1]!”\cRemember? That's the quote you gave\nus as the battle clincher last time.\cI never, ever forget stuff like that!
The last time we battled, you stomped\nus before we could brace ourselves…\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, didn't you\nthrow a POKé BALL at us?\cWe were shocked! So we told everyone,\njust everyone, about it!\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, your item\nskills cleverly did us in.\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, we managed\nto look respectable.\cAnyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
Anyway, what do you think?\nDo you want to be interviewed again?
You will?\nThank you!\cOkay, I need you to describe your\nfeelings about our battle, but it\rhas to be short and sweet. Go!

GABBY: Oh…\cOkay, but don't give up!\nWe'll be keeping an eye out for you!
GABBY: We'll be keeping an eye out\nfor you!
GABBY: Is there a strong TRAINER\nanywhere with a lot of POKéMON?
GABBY: Wow, you are something!\cYou've gotten a lot stronger--a lot--\nsince we last battled.\cWe were right about you when we\nspotted you as a hot TRAINER.\cSo, anyway, what do you think?\nAre you willing to give us an interview\rthis time?
GABBY: That was an intense battle!\nDid you get all that on camera?
TY: Hey, lookie here! A tough-looking\nTRAINER here, of all places!\rCamera's rolling!
TY: Hey, lookie here!\nI remember you!\cI'll get this battle all on this\nhere camera!
TY: You're a natural!\nGot me some prime footage right here!
TY: Do you only have the one POKéMON\nand that's it?\cIf you had more POKéMON, it'd make for\nbetter footage, but…
TY: Yep, we sure spotted a hot TRAINER.\nThis is a huge scoop for us!
TY: Yep, I got it all.\nThat whole battle's on camera.
IN SEARCH OF TRAINERS…\cGABBY: Hi! Today I'm visiting an area\nnear [STR_VAR_1].\cWe're trying to spot some up-and-\ncoming new talent in the field.\cToday, we turned our lens on the\nTRAINER [PLAYER].\cThere's something about this TRAINER\nthat piqued our interest.
We've battled [PLAYER] before, but we\ncan attest that the TRAINER has most\rdefinitely improved from before.\cI knew we were onto someone special\nwhen we spotted this TRAINER!
The best way to determine how strong\na TRAINER is…\cWell, the fastest way is to battle.\nAnd so we began our investigation!\c… …\cThat's how we ended up in battle\nwith [PLAYER].\cIn a dominating performance, we were\nflattened, rolled up, and tossed aside!\c[PLAYER] is ruthlessly strong…\cHere's our impressions after having\nbattled our featured TRAINER.
The combination of [STR_VAR_1] and\n[STR_VAR_3] was divine!\cThe sight of them--[STR_VAR_1] and\n[STR_VAR_3]--selflessly supporting\reach other in the thick of battle…\cIt was a marvelous sight to behold!\c[STR_VAR_2] was the move the TRAINER\nused last in our battle.\cThe move [STR_VAR_2] is [STR_VAR_1]\nand [STR_VAR_3]'s sign of friendship!
…I lost confidence in myself as\na result of our encounter.\cWe were beaten before we could launch\na single attack.\rOhhh… Snivel…\cIn spite of that, [PLAYER]'s battles\nare worth seeing.\cI recommend confident TRAINERS to\nchallenge [PLAYER].
There's only one thing to be said.\nDon't you dare throw a POKé BALL during\ra TRAINER battle!\c[PLAYER] is certainly strong, but has\nno clue about the basic rules.\cTo our TV audience, I have a request.\cIf you see [PLAYER], please caution\nthe TRAINER!
[PLAYER] is adept at reading the\nopponent's actions.\cThe timing of item usage was remarkably\neffective!
Honestly speaking, I thought that\nI might even be pretty good.\cWhile we did end up losing, we did have\na hotly contested battle.\cBut if you're struggling against me,\nyou have a ways to go, [PLAYER]!
After our battle, we asked [PLAYER] for\na succinct summary.\cThe TRAINER replied, “[STR_VAR_1].”\c[PLAYER]'s POKéMON [STR_VAR_2] and\n[STR_VAR_3]…\rAnd “[STR_VAR_1]”…\cMmm! That's deep! There's deep\nsignificance behind that quote!\cIt's no surprise--a good TRAINER has\ngood things to say.\cThat's all for today!\nSee you again on our next broadcast!

[PLAYER] received the EGG from\nthe DAY-CARE MAN.
Take good care of it.
By the way, about your [STR_VAR_1],\nit seemed to be friendly with\r[STR_VAR_2]'s [STR_VAR_3].\cI may even have seen it receiving\na piece of MAIL.
If you want to pick up your POKéMON,\nhave a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you! Your [STR_VAR_1] and\n[STR_VAR_2] are doing fine.
I really will keep it.\nYou do want this, yes?
I'm the DAY-CARE LADY.\cWe can raise POKéMON for you.\cWould you like us to raise one?
Which POKéMON should we raise for\nyou?
Fine, we'll raise your [STR_VAR_1]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.
We can raise two of your POKéMON.\nWould you like us to raise one more?
My husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then.\nCome again.
You don't have enough money…
Will you take back the other one,\ntoo?
Fine.\nCome again.
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nYour POKéMON can only be doing good!
By level, your [STR_VAR_1] has\ngrown by [STR_VAR_2].
Your POKéMON team is full.\nMake room, then come see me.
Which POKéMON will you take back?
If you want your [STR_VAR_1] back,\nit will cost $[STR_VAR_2].
Perfect!\nHere's your POKéMON.
[PLAYER] took back [STR_VAR_1] from\nthe DAY-CARE LADY.
Oh? But you have just one\nPOKéMON.\cCome back another time.
Will you take your POKéMON back?
If you leave me that POKéMON,\nwhat will you battle with?\cCome back another time.
Huh?
Huh?\nNow, now.\cIf you leave that POKéMON with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\cYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, I dare say.
Oh? Did you want to make some [POKEBLOCK]S\nwith this old-timer?
Excellent!
Oh…\nYou've made this old-timer sad…
Do you know how to make a [POKEBLOCK]?
Let's get started, then!\cLet's BERRY BLENDER!
Okay, a little explanation, then.\cOh, don't worry, it's quite simple.\cWhen the BLENDER's arrow comes to\nyour marker, just press the A Button.\cThat's all you have to do.\nYou'll see how easy it is when you try.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any [POKEBLOCK]S.
Well, that won't do at all now, will it?\cIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.\cThat way, we could make some [POKEBLOCK]S\ntogether using the BERRY BLENDER.
If I had some BERRIES left over,\nI'd gladly give you one…\cBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nWe'll have to do this another time.
But your [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full.\cYou should use some [POKEBLOCK]S before\nyou come see me again.
But you don't have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYou should get a [POKEBLOCK] CASE and then\ncome see me.
Let's get blending already!
I wonder what kind of [POKEBLOCK] I'll get?\nThis is so exciting!
Hi, there! Did you want to blend some\n[POKEBLOCK]S with us?
Okay!
That's too bad…\cBut we'll always be around whenever\nyou get the urge to blend!
Of course, you do know how to\nblend [POKEBLOCK]S, don't you?
Let's get started, then!\cLet's BERRY BLENDER!
Okay!\nLet me explain it to you!\cWhen the spinning BLENDER's arrow\nreaches your marker, just press\rthe A Button.\cThat's all it takes.\nPretty easy, don't you think?
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYou don't have any BERRIES.\cYou can't make any [POKEBLOCK]S without\nBERRIES…\cWe'll always be around whenever you\nget hold of some BERRIES to blend.
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYour [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full.\cYou should use some [POKEBLOCK]S and\nthen come back.
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYou don't have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYou should get a [POKEBLOCK] CASE and\nthen come back.
Oh, hello! Did you want to make some\n[POKEBLOCK]S with our little group?
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear me…\cYou've left us in shock!
Naturally, you know how to make\n[POKEBLOCK]S, don't you?
Okay, dear!\nLet's get started!\cLet's BERRY BLENDER!
Oh, dear!\cThen, I'll explain it to you nicely.\cWhen the BLENDER's arrow spins to\nyour marker, press the A Button.\cThat's all it takes.\nIsn't it simple?
You don't have any BERRIES,\ndo you?\cIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any [POKEBLOCK]S.\cWe'll always be making [POKEBLOCK]S here,\nso let's make some together when\ryou get a BERRY or two.
Your [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full,\nit looks like.\cYou should use some [POKEBLOCK]S up\nand then come back.
You haven't gotten a [POKEBLOCK] CASE\nyet, it looks like.\cYou need to get a [POKEBLOCK] CASE before\nyou come back.
Okay! Today's going to be the day that\nI set a new BLENDER speed record!
Oh, dear!\nYou look as if you're good at blending.\rWould you like to join us?
I'm going to make delicious [POKEBLOCK]S\nand make my POKéMON cuter.
[POKEBLOCK]S will be made with your friends \nfrom BERRIES in the BERRY BLENDER.\cIs it okay to save the game before\nlinking with your friends?
Searching for your friends…\n… … B Button: Cancel
[STR_VAR_1] arrived.
[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2] arrived.
[STR_VAR_1], [STR_VAR_2], and\n[STR_VAR_3] arrived.
You have no BERRIES.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
Your [POKEBLOCK] CASE is full.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
You don't have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.
I love making [POKEBLOCK]S.\cI always have some BERRIES with me.
If you'd like, we could make some\n[POKEBLOCK]S together using the\rBERRY BLENDER.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cWell, that won't do at all now, will it?\cIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.
We'll use it to make [POKEBLOCK]S together\nusing the BERRY BLENDER.
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\cIf I had some left over, I'd gladly\ngive you one…\cBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nSorry about that.
 so pretty!
 so darling!
 so relaxed!
 so sunny!
 so desirable!
 so exciting!
 so amusing!
 so magical!

\nDon't you agree?
I so want to go on a vacation.\nWould you happen to know a nice place?
I bought crayons with 120 colors!\nDon't you think that's nice?
Wouldn't it be nice if we could float\naway on a cloud of bubbles?
When you write on a sandy beach,\nthey wash away. It makes me sad.
What's the bottom of the sea like?\nJust once I would so love to go!
When you see the setting sun, does it\nmake you want to go home?
Lying back in the green grass…\nOh, it's so, so nice!
SECRET BASES are so wonderful!\nCan't you feel the excitement?
If you have POKéMON with you, then\nyou're an official POKéMON TRAINER!\rYou can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost…\nI should have trained mine more…
Listen, you. If you're strong,\nyou should have told me before!
I've been working hard at this since\nI saw you before.\cI'd like to battle you again, so can\nyou register me in your POKéNAV?
I'd like to battle you again, so can\nyou register me in your POKéNAV?
Ever since I lost to you, I desperately\ntrained my POKéMON.\rYou can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost…\nIs my training method not right?
If you're going to get stronger,\nI'll get stronger, too.
Did you just become a TRAINER?\nWe're both beginners!
I called you because I thought\nI could beat you…
I haven't won once yet…\nI wish I would win soon…
Hahah! Our eyes met!\nI'll take you on with my BUG POKéMON!
Ow! Down and out!
If you lock eyes with a TRAINER,\nyou have to challenge! It's a rule!
I'm going to keep winning and aim\nto be the best TRAINER.\cHelp me further my career!
I ended up furthering your career…
To keep winning my way up, I see that\nI have to catch more POKéMON.
Did you feel the tug of our\nsoul-soothing fragrance?
You weren't led astray by our aroma…
Aromatherapy is a form of mental\nhealing that works with fragrances.
AMY: I'm AMY.\nAnd this is my little sister LIV.\rWe battle together!
AMY: Uh-oh, we lost.
AMY: You have to think about all\nkinds of things when you're battling\ragainst two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one\nPOKéMON with you.\rYou can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one\nteam.
LIV: Oh, we lost, big sister…
LIV: We work perfectly together,\nme and my big sister…\cBut we still lost…
LIV: Really, we're a lot better…\nIt's true! We'll show you next time!
LIV: If you want to battle us,\nyou have to have two POKéMON!\rIt's not fair if you don't!
AMY: I'm AMY.\nAnd this is my little sister LIV.\rWe battle together!
AMY: Aww, boo!\nWe couldn't win again…
AMY: You have to think about all\nkinds of things when you're battling\ragainst two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one\nPOKéMON with you.\rYou can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one\nteam.
LIV: Awww, we lost again…\nBig sister…
LIV: We work perfectly together,\nme and my big sister…\cBut why did we lose again?
LIV: If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two POKéMON!\rIt's not fair if you don't!
Gah! My fishing line's all snarled up!\nI'm getting frustrated and mean!\rThat's it! Battle me!
Gah! Lost it!\nI'm even more annoyed now!
Gah, I'm still boiling mad…\nGrrrrr…
My POKéMON is delightfully adorable!\nDon't be shy--I'll show you!
Oh, my gosh!\nMy darling POKéMON!
My delightful POKéMON looks darling\neven when it's fainted!
I'll get you to come out and look in\non my delightful POKéMON again!
Hi, you! My delightfully adorable\nPOKéMON has become more darling!
Oh!\nMy darling POKéMON!
The more I spend time with it,\nthe more adorable my POKéMON becomes.
This sort of distance…\nYou should just swim it!
Oh, that's good going!
Oh, I understand where you're coming\nfrom now.\cIf I had a POKéMON that trusty,\nI'd want to SURF on it, too!
Watch where you're going!\nWe're going to crash!
Groan…
I'm a poor swimmer so I was practicing…\nSorry for almost crashing into you.
Whoa!\nHow'd you get into a space this small?
Whoa!\nThe kid can rock!
Do you like cramped quarters\nlike this?
Did my guitar's wailing draw you in?
My one-man show is ruined…
I was playing my guitar where few\npeople were around, but a lot of fans\rhave gathered.\cHeh, maybe I should turn pro.
GINA: Okay, let's battle with our\nPOKéMON!
GINA: Losing upsets me!
GINA: You are strong!\nWe have to train lots more!
GINA: Oh? Only one POKéMON?\nThen, we don't battle with you.\cIf there's only one POKéMON, it will\nbe lonesome. That's not nice.
MIA: We are twins, so we battle\nPOKéMON together.
MIA: We battled together, but we\nboth lost…
MIA: We will train our POKéMON more\nand be strong like you.
MIA: You want to battle with us?\cIt's a big no-no if you don't have two\nPOKéMON with you.\rWe're too strong for you!
Why keep it a secret?\nI'm the WATER POKéMON expert!\cHuh?\nYou don't know me?
I thought I wasn't too bad, if I may\nsay so, but I guess not… Bleah…
I got too into fishing.\nI forgot I had to raise my POKéMON…
Leaving footprints in the sand is\nso fun!
Waah! I got sand in my runners!\nThey're all gritty!
I want to leave my footprints in\nthe sand everywhere, but they\rdisappear quickly…
Should I…\nOr shouldn't I?\cOkay, sure, I will battle!
I shouldn't have battled…
If you're faced with a decision and\nyou let someone else choose for you,\ryou will regret it, however things\rturn out.
You're strong, but should I register\nyou in my POKéNAV?\rMaybe I shouldn't…\cOkay, sure, I will register you!
You're strong, but should I register\nyou in my POKéNAV?\rMaybe I shouldn't…\cOkay, sure, I will register you!
Come on, battle with me!
Ohh…\nI thought I could win…
I made the decision to battle, so\nI can accept this loss with grace.\cI am still upset about losing!
Oh, sure, I'll accept your challenge.\nI have a lot of money.
Why couldn't I win?
There are some things money can't buy.\nThat's POKéMON…
Hm?\nAh, you've obtained a POKéNAV.\cI will gladly register you.\nAfter all, I have plenty of money.
Hm?\nAh, you've obtained a POKéNAV.\cI will gladly register you.\nAfter all, I have plenty of money.
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch\nof things about POKéMON.
I lost again?\nWhy couldn't I win?
I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't\nseem to win at POKéMON…\cIt's so deep, the world of POKéMON…
We must have been fated to meet.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my!
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
Hello, we meet again.\cWe seem to be drawn together. Let's\nregister each other in our POKéNAVS.
We should commemorate how we seem\nto be drawn to each other.\cLet's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS.
Hello, we meet again.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my…\nI did the best that I could…
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
I fished up a tough-looking POKéMON!\cIt has this magical quality to it!\nIt surely looks tough, yes it does!
What the…
Hey, MAGIKARP, you sure don't live up\nto your name, do you?
There's supposed to be a mystical\nrock around here.\rDo you know anything about it?
I was thinking too much about that\nrock, while my POKéMON remained weak…
I can spend hours and hours staring\nat a nice rock without growing bored.
Whew! I was worried that a kid was\ndrowning when I saw you.\cYou seem to be okay, so what do you\nsay to a battle?
Glub… Glub…
If you are drowning, the signal is to\nwave one arm toward the beach.
Swimming the deep blue sea…\nIt feels the greatest!
I lost…\nNow I'm feeling blue…
Why is the sea blue?\cI learned about that at the MUSEUM in\nSLATEPORT, but I forgot.
My body feels lighter in the water.\nIt's as if I've gotten slimmer!
I'm floating…
Your body weight is reduced to just\none tenth in the water.\cThat would make me…\nWhoops! I'm not telling you my weight!
The blue, blue sky…\nThe vast sea…\rIt's so peaceful…
I lost while I was lounging!
I want to be told I'm relaxing to be\nwith. Giggle.
I'm convinced that the sea keeps\nsecrets from us.
Yes…\nI am no good at battling…
I'm sure there are many secrets to be\ndiscovered in the world's seas.\cI mean to find them all!
Huh? I'm so weak, but you're willing\nto register me in your POKéNAV?
I've told you that I'm weak…\nAre you sure you want to do this?
Yes…\nI didn't think I could win.
I may be weak at battling, but my\ndrive to explore can't be bested.\cI will travel the seas all around\nthe world!
I'm exhausted from swimming.\nI'm just not used to it.\cI need a battle for a change of pace!
I lost because I battled at sea.
Yeah, for me, the sky is a much better\nmatch than the sea.
Which do you prefer, fishing in the\nsea or a stream?
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost\nspectacularly!
Fishing is the greatest whether it's\nin the sea or a stream.\rYou agree with me, right?
Fishing's great, but so is battling.\nIf you don't mind, can we meet again?
I caught a bunch of POKéMON fishing.\nI'll show you an impressive battle!
I lost again spectacularly!
Win or lose, POKéMON are the greatest!\nYou agree with me, right?
What do people do if they need to go\nto a washroom?\cWhat if my ROD hooks a big one while\nI'm in the washroom? I just can't go…
I lost because I'm trying to not go\nto the washroom…
Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook\na big one!
Hahahah! I'm a lousy runner, but in\nthe water you can't catch me!
I give up!
I wouldn't lose in a swim race…
The sea is my backyard. I'm not going\nto take it easy because you're a kid!
Did you take it easy on me by any\nchance?
Drifting along with the waves…\nI love it! Why don't you give it a try?
Yawn…\cI must have drifted off to sleep while\nI was drifting in the waves.
Ahaha, I lost…\nI'll take a snooze, I think…
Floating and being rocked by\nthe waves--it's like sleeping in\ra plush, comfy bed.
The sea is like my backyard.\nLet's battle!
I lost on my home field…\nI'm in shock!
I swim the seas with a heart full of\ndreams…\cIt's a song!\nAnyways, I'm swimming some more.
You've shocked me to the bone!\nWell, so you won't forget me…
Swimming in the big, wide sea,\nmy POKéMON has grown stronger!
What a shock!\cMy POKéMON has gotten stronger, but\nI stayed weak as a TRAINER!
What you learn in battle makes you\na stronger TRAINER.\rThe waves taught me that.
Do you know a little town called\nDEWFORD?
I hate this!
A weird saying is getting really\ntrendy at DEWFORD HALL.
Did you want to battle me?\nSure, I'll go with you!
I wasn't good enough for you.
I think you're going to keep getting\nbetter. I'll go for it, too!
LISA: We challenge you as a sister\nand brother!
LISA: Awesome.\nYou're in a different class of tough.
LISA: Do you have any friends who\nwould go to the beach with you?
LISA: If you want to battle with us,\nbring more POKéMON.
RAY: We always battle POKéMON,\nme and my sister.\cI always lose, but we can beat you\n2-on-2!
RAY: Wowee, you're at a higher level\nthan us!
RAY: My sister gave me my POKéMON.\nI raised it, and now it's my important\rpartner!
RAY: If you want to battle us,\ngo bring some more POKéMON!
I'm in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm nowhere near tired!
That exhausted me…
I still have swimming and running left\nto do after this.\cAm I going to be okay?
My dream is to swim the world's seven\nseas!
I won't be able to swim the seven seas\nlike this…
Playing with marine POKéMON is one of\nthe pleasures of swimming!
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to\nthe ABANDONED SHIP, too?
I'm sinking!\nGlub… Glub…
Some people even go inside that\nABANDONED SHIP.
My liar of a boyfriend told me that\nI look great in a bikini…
Oh, boo!
Even if it's a lie, I love being told\nI look great…\rWe girls are so complex…
I love the sea!\nI forget all my worries when I swim!
When I lose a battle, I get all\nstressed out!
Work off your stress by swimming!\nIt's so healthy!
I love WATER-type POKéMON.\nI love other POKéMON, too!
Waaah! I lost!\nWaaah! Waaah!
Shouting is good for me!\nIt uplifts me!
I love tough TRAINERS, too!\nRegister me in your POKéNAV!
Win or lose, I love battling at sea!
Waaah! I lost again!\nWaaah! Waaah!
If you're faced with a challenge,\ntry shouting at the sea!
I take huge pride in my POKéMON.\nWe'll show you one speedy battle!
That wasn't cute at all.
Since I'm at sea like this, I wouldn't\nmind putting on a pink, frilly swimsuit…
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!\nThis is what you call “cut”!
Aiyah!\nFlubbed out!
Hiyah!\cMy sculpted abs have nothing to do\nwith POKéMON battles!
Are you properly protected against\nthe sun?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Cheeks are the most prone to burning!
I've laid anchor in ports around\nthe world, but SLATEPORT's the best.
You're the best!
In the best port was the best\nTRAINER…
Urrrrppp…\nBattle? With me?
Urp… Ooooooohhhhhh…\nUrrrrpppp…
I'm usually stronger than this!\nI'm just seasick as a dog!\cI'm a SAILOR, but…
I'm thirsty… I could go for a SODA POP\nat the SEASHORE HOUSE…
Groan…
I'm getting famished… My inner tube\nlooks like a giant doughnut…
Will you have another match with me\nwhen I'm not all thirsty?
I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in\nme for a battle!
I lost…\nIt's because I'm hungry…
When you eat on a beach, everything\nseems to taste a little better.
Doesn't a beach umbrella look like\na giant flower?
Mommy!
If you look at the beach from the sky,\nit looks like a big flower garden!
Me?\nI'm here every day!
I'm not losing to you again!\nThat's why I have my inner tube!
Mommy!
If I have an inner tube, me and my\nPOKéMON's cuteness goes way up!
I can't swim without my inner tube,\nbut I won't lose at POKéMON!
Did I lose because I have an inner\ntube?
My inner tube is a fashion item.\nI can't be seen without it.
Hi, big TRAINER.\nWill you battle with me?
Oh, you're strong.
How did you get to be so strong?
Wahahah! This dude's going to catch\nhimself a big one!
This dude just lost one…
This dude thinks you're a big one.\nNo, you're a big-one-to-be!
PAUL: Well, this is a mood-breaker.\cI wish you wouldn't disturb our\nprecious time together.
PAUL: Well, I give up.
PAUL: Well, don't tell anyone that\nwe're here.\rThis is just our private world of two!
PAUL: We're totally, deeply in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON battle\rtogether.
MEL: We're, like, totally in love.\nOur romance is heating up all of HOENN!
MEL: We lost, and it's my fault!\nPAUL will hate me!
MEL: Um, PAUL, are you angry with me?\nPlease don't be angry.
MEL: We're, like, deeply and truly in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON\rbattle together.
Tadaah! See?\nMy inner tube's round!
Oh, oh!\nToo bad!
After I showed you my round inner\ntube, too…
I can't swim, so I'm pretending\nto swim.
I thought so!\nI didn't think we could win.
When I learn how to swim, I think\nmy POKéMON will become tougher.
For a guy as macho as me, this kind\nof POKéMON is the perfect match!
I'm cool even in defeat, hey?
For a guy as macho as me, a port\nis the perfect setting!\cI guess I'll head for SLATEPORT.
Whoa! Watch it!\nI guess you're not used to BIKE racing.
Whoa!\nMy brakes failed!
Flat tires and brake problems can\ncause serious injury!\rInspect your BIKE for problems!
Yo, you!\nCan you keep up with my speed?
Crash and burn!
Speed alone won't let me win at POKéMON.\nI need to reconsider this…
Don't panic if your BIKE's going fast!
I shouldn't panic during POKéMON\nbattles…
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.
I'll keep chugging on without stressing.\nGive me a shout if you're up to it.
Aren't you going a little too fast?\nTake it easy and let's battle.
I didn't panic, but I still lost…
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.
The triathlon is hard in the extreme.\cYou have to complete the three events\nof swimming, cycling, and running.
POKéMON battles are hard, too!
I'm exhausted, so I need a break.\nIt's important to get proper rest.
You know, I like you!\nLet's have a rematch on CYCLING ROAD.
Isn't it neat to hold a battle while\ncycling?
Wow…\nHow could you be so strong?
Were you going after a record?\cI'm sorry if I held you up!
I've been riding without stopping.\nMy thighs are like rocks!
I'm worried about muscle cramps…
Oh, you have some GYM BADGES?\nNo wonder you're so strong!
I have foreseen your intentions!\nI cannot possibly lose!
I failed to prophesize my own demise!
I see your future…\cHmm…\nI see a shining light…
Ahahahaha!\nI'll dazzle you with my wonders!
I wondrously lost!
You managed to win only because it was\na wonder! Yes, a wonder!\rDon't think you can win all the time!
Could I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?
I wanted to complete\nmy collection…
When I see a POKéMON that I don't know,\nmy passion as a collector is ignited!
I like collecting MATCH CALL\nregistrations, too…
Hi, have you caught any new POKéMON?\cCould I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?
Your POKéMON…\nI envy you.
Oh, I long to make all rare POKéMON\nmine!
Hey!\nDon't sneak up behind me like that!
I lost!\nDrat!
Fishing is all about concentration.\nYou have to focus on the floater.
Ahahaha! I would go anywhere to show\noff my delightful POKéMON.
Oh, dear, this won't do.
Rather than battling, perhaps I should\nshow off my POKéMON at the FAN CLUB.
That wasn't close to what I could\ndo to show off my POKéMON.\cI'll have you as my captive audience\nas often as possible!
Ahahahaha! I would be happy to show\noff my POKéMON as often as you like!
Oh, dear, this won't do.
I don't think that I could ever stop\nfrom showing off my POKéMON.\cBut I like to battle, too!
I found some cool POKéMON in the grass\naround here!
Being cool isn't enough to win…
It's hard to battle with POKéMON you\njust caught.
I fell off CYCLING ROAD…\cI'll get over my embarrassment by\nbattling with you!
Oops!\nI ended up losing!
Falling… Losing…\nThis is so humiliating for me!
Okay! Full-throttle time! If you can't\ngroove, you get left behind!
You got into the groove all right…
This isn't going to bring me down!\nLosing has made me a better man!
When cute POKéMON help each other…\nYou won't see a more adorable sight!
Have you no compassion or pity?
Okay, okay, you've done the best you\ncould, my pretties.
Oh, hey! Those GO-GOGGLES suit you.\nBut I think they look better on me.\cLet's decide who they look better on\nwith a battle!
I couldn't see what was happening at\nmy sides because of the GO-GOGGLES.
The GO-GOGGLES make it possible to\nget through sandstorms.\rThat makes me happy!
I'm having a picnic in the desert.\cYou can always find a TRAINER,\nso I can enjoy a battle here, too!
Ohhh! You're mean!
When you're battling in a sandstorm,\nwatch out for your POKéMON's HP.\cIt can faint if you don't keep\nan eye on it!
Wearing these GO-GOGGLES makes me\nfeel like a superhero.\rRight now, nobody can beat me!
I can't win on spirit alone…
I'm going to be a real hero one day.\nI'm going to work harder to make me\rand my POKéMON stronger.
I heard there are fossils to be found\nin the desert. Where could they be?
I came up short…
If they can find fossils in the desert,\nit must have been a sea before.
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\rI am to be challenged?
While I have searched for ruins,\nI've not searched for strong POKéMON.
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years?\nWhich was it now?
I haven't been searching for any\ntough POKéMON.\cBut, for some reason, I sure do like\nPOKéNAVS.
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years?\nAnyway, am I to be challenged?
I've found no ruins, nor have I found\nany strong POKéMON…
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\cNo, wait, was that forty years\nI've searched?\cHmm… It could even be fifty…\nHow long have I been at this?
I'm full of pep!\nAnd my POKéMON is peppy, too!
My POKéMON lost its pep…
When I see a TRAINER with a lot of pep,\nI can't help looking.
I don't know where you're going,\nbut would you like to battle?
Oh, you're disgustingly good!
I'm thinking that I should go to\nMT. CHIMNEY, but the view around\rhere is very nice, too.
To train myself, I challenge all\nwhom I meet!
Uncle! I give up!
All I can do is keep training until\nI can defeat strong TRAINERS such\ras yourself.
Show me how much you've toughened\nyour POKéMON.
I see, you've toughened them\nconsiderably.
POKéMON and TRAINERS learn much\nthrough battling.\cWhat's important is to never give up\neven if you lose.
There is much to be learned from\nyour training style.\cI request a rematch if it\nbehooves you.
We're training here to elevate our\ngame to the next level.\rStay and train with us!
Ooh, you're decent!
Since you're that strong, you should\naim for the POKéMON LEAGUE.
Oh, your POKéMON look like serious\nactors.\rI have to ask you for an engagement.
They didn't just look strong,\nthey are strong!
I thought I was raising my POKéMON\ndiligently, but, oh no, there is still\rmuch to be done.
I wish I could become friends with\nmore strong people like you!
You can make POKéMON stronger or\nweaker depending on the moves you\rteach them.\cWhat kinds of moves do your POKéMON\nknow?
You've taught them good moves!
Maybe I should have stopped my\nPOKéMON from evolving until they\rlearned better moves…
I shouldn't have come to a place like\nthis for a picnic!
Aww!\nI really shouldn't have come!
In a sandstorm like this, I can't set\nthe places for a picnic even with my\rGO-GOGGLES on…
How tough are you?\nWe shall expose that secret!
Oh! Your strength!\nIt is shrouded in mystery!
This desert hoards mysteries in\nits shifting sands!
I'll give you some of my sandwich\nif you'll lose.
Tch! I thought a sandwich would be\nenough of a bribe…
My SANDSHREW loves eating\nmy sandwiches.
This is my favorite kind of POKéMON!
Wait!\nDid you get a good look at my POKéMON?
When having a battle, I get a kick out\nof showing off my POKéMON.\cI bet everyone feels that way when\nthey enter a battle!
Show me how to put a little excitement\ninto my life.
Oh… My…\nThat was too much excitement.
My pulse is still racing.\nYou're one fabulous TRAINER.
When you're as famished as I am,\nthere is no room for pity!
Groan…
My stomach is grumbling!\nMaybe I can grill some BERRIES…
Did you come from MAUVILLE?\nThen you should be full of energy!
Ooh lala!\nThat's a lot to take!
This road here…\nYou have quite a ways to travel.
Hahahaha!\nHow about we have a battle?\rYou and me!\rHahahaha!
I lost!\nHahahaha!
Hahahahaha! Something flew up my nose!\nHahahaha-hatchoo!
My legs are solid from pounding up\nand down the mountains.\cThey're not going to buckle easily,\nfriend!
Ouch! My legs cramped up!
Try hiking, and I mean really\npounding, on these mountain trails\rwith a heavy pack weighing dozens of\rpounds.\cThat, my friend, will get your body\ninto serious shape.
Ow, my legs have cramped up.\nCan you grab me some bandages from\rmy backpack?\cNo, that's my POKéNAV!\nOh, fine, I'll register you.
I've been keeping fit by hiking.\nPower, I have in spades!
I got trumped in power?
I hear there are some seriously tough\nTRAINERS on top of MT. CHIMNEY.\cI intend to get up there and give them\na challenge!
I'm strong.\nI won't cry if I lose.
Waaaah!
I'm not crying because I miss my mommy!\nSnivel…
When you're out on a picnic, why,\nyou simply have to sing!\rCome on, sing with me!
Oh, you're so strong!
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad\nat singing or POKéMON.\cIf you have the most fun, you win!
I caught hot POKéMON in FIERY PATH!\nTake a look!
What a bumpy ride that was!
I like the way you battle.\nIt has a certain flair to it.
Oh, aren't you an adorable TRAINER!\nPlease, I need a romantic battle!\rI'm somewhat decent!
Oh, how strong you are!\nYou've given me quite a shock!
Are you busy right now?\nI was thinking that maybe we can have\ra rematch right now…\rBut it's all right if you're busy.
Can you guess why it's so cool\naround here?
Peeuuw!\nThat stinks!
The volcanic ash blocks the sun,\nso it doesn't get very warm.\cThat's good for me--I can't stand heat!
The volcano's eruption is proof that\nthe earth is alive.
You're some kind of strong!
Ouch! Owww! I can't see!\nI got ashes in my eyelashes!\cGet it? Ashes and eyelashes?\cOkay, that was bad, sorry…
I use this parasol to ward off this\nfilthy, yucky volcanic ash from\rmy dear NUMEL.
Huff, huff…\nI am exhausted…
You're very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!
Here, slide under my parasol.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.
Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while?\nMay I invite you to battle?
Oh, how super!
You've remained very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
I must refine the art of concealment.\nI bid thee farewell.
Yiiyaah! Witness the ancient ninja\ntechnique of POKéNAV registration!
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
My flawless concealment was let down\nby my immature battle skills…\cI bid thee farewell.
Thanks for finding me!\nBut we still have to battle!
I'll use my ninjutsu on you…\n“VOLCANIC ASH SWIRL CLOAK”!\c…What?\nIt's already over?
You know what's crummy about hiding?\nIt's lonely if no one comes along.
TORI: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.
TORI: We lost… It's boring, so I'm going\nto get some more ashes.
TORI: How much ash do we have?\nEnough for a WHITE FLUTE, I hope.
TORI: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we didn't, we would lose!
TIA: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.
TIA: We couldn't win… It's boring,\nso I'm getting some more ashes.
TIA: We have a lot of ashes!\nI think enough for a WHITE FLUTE!
TIA: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we don't, we won't win!
Pfft, with these wings I can\nflick you away!
A… What?
I don't know what to say when I get\nbeaten so easily…
The warmth here is making me drowsy.\nBattle with me so I can stay awake.
This is a dream.\nI'm sure of it…
Losing burns me up…\nI'm just going to sleep right here!\rZzz!
Were you maybe in the middle\nof gathering volcanic ashes?
Ehehe.\nWe got beaten cleanly.
I ought to hide under the ashes, too.
Y-you want to battle with me?\nEven though I just caught my POKéMON?
Y-you're all happy to win?\nEven though it's only me?
Oh, so now you want to say a word to\nthe loser?\cAren't you just the coolest?\nHumph!
Yodelayhihoo!\c… …\cYou're supposed to shout\n“yodelayhihoo” since it doesn't\recho here!
Yodelayhihoo!
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there\nwas someone copying me and shouting\rback, “Yodelayhihoo.”
If you're not prepared, you shouldn't\nbe up in the mountains!
The mountains are unforgiving…
In the winter, mountains turn deadly\nwith blizzards and avalanches.
Camping's fun! You can fish, roast\nmarshmallows, and tell spooky stories!\cBut the best of all are the POKéMON\nbattles!
Way too strong!
I think it's great that I can go\ncamping with my POKéMON.
I need to exercise after a meal.\nLet's have a match!
Oh, no!
I just had a tasty meal.\nI'm getting drowsy…
Ufufufufufu…\nWant to battle against my POKéMON?
M-My POKéMON…
A big body that's all lumpy and hard,\nenormous horns, and vicious fangs…\cUfufufufu…\nI wish I had a POKéMON like that…
Don't forget what you've done to me!\nI'll make it so you can't forget!
Ufufufufufu…\nCome on, battle my POKéMON…
I feel so lucky getting to see your\nPOKéMON…
Ufufufufufu…\cWhen I see POKéMON battling, I get all\nshivery and shaky…
If you're lighting a campfire,\nmake sure you have water handy.
Thanks for dousing my fire!
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\cDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
You set my spirit on fire.\nLet's register each other!
Have you learned to keep water handy\nfor campfires?
I got hosed down before I could\nflare up, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\cDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand\na chance against me.\rSo, bring on your POKéMON!
If we were fishing, I would've won…
I think I'll try my luck at landing\na big one at METEOR FALLS.\cThere has to be something in there.\nI just know it.
I like to fish. But I also like to\nbattle!\cIf anyone challenges me, I'm there,\neven if I'm fishing.
I like to battle, but that doesn't\nmean I'm good at it…
This time I'll do it!\cI always think that, so I can't walk\naway from fishing or POKéMON.
TYRA: Well, sure.\nI'm in the mood for it.\rI'll teach you a little about POKéMON.
TYRA: What an amazing battle style!
TYRA: I was teaching my junior IVY\nabout POKéMON.
TYRA: Giggle…\nIf you want to battle with us, just one\rPOKéMON isn't enough!
IVY: Who taught you about POKéMON?
IVY: What an amazing battle style!
IVY: I started training POKéMON\nbecause TYRA, my student mentor,\rtaught me!
IVY: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nI think it must feel lonesome.
I landed a big one!\nA huge one, I tell you!
What was that about?\nDid mine lose in size?
Okay!\nI'll just fish me a bigger one!
Me!\nI'm not just a pretty face!
That wasn't cute in the least!
I don't want a POKéMON that's\njust cute.\cI adore cute ones that have a quirk\nor two!
Have you made your POKéMON evolve\nvery much?
Oh, I see.\nThat's good to know.
Some POKéMON change so much when\nthey evolve, it's startling!
Hm…\nYou seem rather capable…\rLet me keep you company!
You're much stronger than\nI'd imagined!
There is no such thing as a born genius.\nIt all depends on effort!\rThat is what I believe…
Hmm… A loss this thorough has been\na distant memory.\cIf you would allow it, I wish for\nanother opportunity to do battle.
Hm… As always, your agility speaks\nfor itself.\rCome, keep me company!
As strong as ever!
All it takes is effort!\cI lost because I haven't put in enough\neffort!
You!\cMy MACHOP!\cDemand a battle!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My MACHOP crew!\cSo long as they seek power, I will\ngrow strong with them!
My strongest skill is busting bricks\nwith my forehead!
Ugwaaaah!\nMy head is busted!
I've been teaching my POKéMON karate.\cIt looks like they'll get a lot better\nthan me. I'm excited about that.
You impress me! Give me a rematch\nafter I redo my training!
After you beat me, we trained hard to\nimprove our skills.\rCome on, give us a rematch!
Ugwaaah!\nWe lost again!
My POKéMON will grow stronger!\nI'll redouble my training!
This beach is my secret training spot!\nDon't come butting in!
I haven't trained enough!
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce\nimpact and prevent injury.\rThis is the perfect place to train.
Okay, fine, you're free to come here.\nIn return, I'd like to battle you again.
Okay, let's get this battle on!
I can battle but my POKéMON…
Even when I lose, I still get some\nenjoyment out of it.\rIt must be that I love POKéMON.
I have a rare POKéMON!\nWould you like me to show you?
You…\nYou want my POKéMON, don't you?
I have this rare POKéMON.\nIt's enough to keep me satisfied.
I'll battle while I'm running!\nTry to keep up with me!
Gasp, gasp…
I made the mistake of trying to battle\nwhile running!\cI should take a run to calm down…
Take that!\nUltra POKéMON ninja attack!
Waaah!\nOur strategy failed!
But my POKéMON were ultra,\nweren't they?
My POKéMON have black belt-level\nstrength!
This is too humiliating!
I rarely meet anyone who's better\nthan me…\cI get it now!\nYou're a GYM LEADER, aren't you?
Our eyes met!\nThere's no getting away now!
Gah!\nNot bad!
Oh, well.\nI think I will TELEPORT home.
You've disturbed my meditation…\nYou'll be punished for it.
You've broken my concentration!
I was meditating with my POKéMON.\nBut this place isn't very peaceful…
If the tunnel doesn't go through, then\nI'll just go over the top.
Gasp… Gasp…\nLosing made me tired…
It's no big deal if there's no tunnel.\nTo a HIKER, mountains are roads!
My POKéMON rule!\nCheck them out!
Ouch! A scrape!\nI have to put on a bandage!
Bandages are signs of toughness!\nI've got another one!
My BUG POKéMON are tough!\nLet's battle!
I lost!\nI thought I had you!
BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.\nSo they get strong quickly, too.
Let me teach you how strong my\nadorable POKéMON is!
You're a notch above me…
POKéMON that possess cuteness and\npower, that's ideal, I think.
We learn all sorts of things at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\cI want to test things out for real!
I slacked off in school…\nThat's why I lost.
I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\cI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?
I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\cI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?
I've been studying seriously at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rI won't lose like I did last time.
Hunh?\nI studied diligently.
I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\rIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I study at school, and I study on\nthe way home, too!
I'm in shock--I lost?
Awww, I'll never become an elegant\nTRAINER like ROXANNE this way!
Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!
Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!
I studied a whole lot since I saw you.\nYou must see my achievements!
I'm in shock.\nI lost again?
You've beaten ROXANNE?\nI can't beat you, then. Not yet.
Just so you know, I've never once been\nbested by anyone at anything.
Oh, my goodness.\nThis is a new experience for me.
My life of luxury affords me all that\nI could possibly desire.\cHowever, when it comes to POKéMON,\nmy wealth has no meaning.
When you lay your eyes on my POKéMON's\ngorgeous fur, their beauty will render\ryou helpless!
Oh, baby, say it isn't so!
Oh, no, no, no!\nYou've mussed up my POKéMON's fur!\rYou've ruined my hairdo, too!\rI'll have to call my stylist now!
We'll rock you hard!
Aiyiyi!\nNo contest at all!
I should try different POKéMON\ntypes, that's what I ought to do.
It's a dead end up here.\nI'm bored, so can we battle?
That was fun even though I lost.
Want to stay here and keep\nme company?
Listen, could I get you to battle\nthe POKéMON I'm raising?
You've raised yours superbly…
POKéMON isn't all about power.\cPolishing a unique aspect of one's\ncharacter is another way of enjoying\rPOKéMON.
I'm going to redouble my training.\nWould you come look in on us?
The POKéMON I've been raising are\nlooking good, just like before.
You know how to raise them properly.\nYou might have DAY CARE skills…
Your POKéMON are growing good!\nYou should enter them in CONTESTS.
Please, allow me to evaluate if you\nhave raised your POKéMON properly.
Yes, they are growing properly.
Try raising POKéMON with more\nattention to their character traits.
I'm glad I met a superb TRAINER in you.\nI hope to see you again.
Allow me to reevaluate if you have\nraised your POKéMON properly.
They are growing admirably.
POKéMON seem to like different kinds\nof [POKEBLOCK]S, depending on their nature.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nwhatever, let's have a battle!
I ran out of energy!
I may have blown it…\cI might have dropped to last during\nthat battle…
POKéMON have to be strong, too?\nI'd like you to train me!
I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm comfortably ahead.\rLet's make this a quick battle!
I ran out of energy again!
I was tops in swimming and cycling,\nbut I'm not quite that confident with\rPOKéMON yet.
I do my triathlon training with POKéMON,\nso I'm pretty confident about my speed.
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.
Training is meaningful only if you\nkeep it up regularly.\cOkay! I'll resume my training!\nTomorrow!
You appear to be training properly…\nIf you'd like, I'll battle you later!
Are you keeping up with your training?\nI sure am!\rLet me show you the evidence!
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.
I'll resume training tomorrow.\nLet's battle again sometime!
Once a BUG CATCHER!\nAnd now a BUG MANIAC!\cBut my love for POKéMON remains\nunchanged!
My ineptitude also remains\nunchanged…
All I did was follow my heart, and now\nthey call me a BUG MANIAC…\cStill, I am an expert on BUG POKéMON,\nso it's only natural that they call me\ra BUG MANIAC.
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner. I have to do good!
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner! Let me win!
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\cI'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: We can't take this lying down!\nYou will come back, won't you?
ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my super\nsenior student partner and beat you!
MEG: Oh, no!\nI'm sorry, ANNA! I let you down…
MEG: I dragged ANNA down…\nIf I didn't, she would have won!
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\cWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
ANNA: I can't keep losing in front of\nmy junior partner, right?
ANNA: I couldn't get into the groove.
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\cI'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my\nsenior partner and win this time!
MEG: Too strong!
MEG: I battled together with my\nsenior partner, but we lost…\cThat's so discouraging…
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\cWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
Isn't it nice? To battle while looking\nat pretty flowers?
Oh, that's quite impressive!
It feels wonderful to go for a jog\nwhile looking at flowers.
Let me demonstrate the power\nhidden within a PSYCHIC POKéMON!
Astonishing!
PSYCHIC POKéMON are complex.\nYou should try catching some.
Concentrate on getting the win.\nThat's how I battle!
I don't waste any time being angry\nover a loss--I would rather train.
I think that if you worry about losing,\nyou're more likely to lose.
The aroma of flowers has a magical\npower. It cleanses us body and soul.
Oh, dear me.\nI seem to have lost.
Flowers, POKéMON…\nI love whatever smells nice.\cStinky things…\nI'll pass.
Sniff… That odor--it's a POKéNAV!\nWe must register each other!
Were you drawn here by the sweet\naroma?
The power of aroma…\nIt didn't seem to do much.
If you use a sweet aroma properly,\nPOKéMON will be attracted by it.
BIRD POKéMON that FLY elegantly in\nthe sky… They're the best!
Urgh…\nI crashed…
You've got great POKéMON.\nI'll have to train mine better.
Take flight!\nMy BIRD POKéMON!
They did take flight…
If they'd get stronger, they'd be able\nto fly more freely…
I'm a FISHERMAN, but also a TRAINER.\nI'm raising the POKéMON I caught.
I thought I was doing okay in my\ntraining…
I couldn't win by training POKéMON\nwhile I fished…\cWas I doing things in half measures?
For FISHERMEN, equipment is the key.\cBut for TRAINERS, the key ingredients\nare POKéMON and heart, of course!
I was beaten in heart?
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle\nbetween a FISHERMAN and a POKéMON.
Let my melody rock your soul!
La-lalala…
An electric guitar doesn't always\nhave to be noisy…\cIt can be strummed to squeeze out\nthis heart-stirring melody…
When I compose better melodies,\nyou have to come listen, okay?
A melody from my POKéMON and me…\nLet us deliver it to your soul.
La-lalala…
When I play, my emotions should reach\nyou through my electric guitar…
Go, go, go!\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3!
Come in, POKéMON! Are you okay?\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3?!
Isn't it cool that I have a POKéMON\nbattle team?\cYou can copy me--I don't mind!
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nWe MIMIC what you do!
Whoopsie!\nI lost!
What's so good about mimicry?\cFufufu…\nYou'll never understand…
So, we finally meet!\nMy BUG POKéMON will keep you company!
I wish we'd never met…
I want to MIMIC you some more.\nCan you hurry up and move?
If you step forward, we step forward.\cIf you turn right, we turn, too…
But if you win, I lose…
I can't MIMIC you winning the match.\nThat's just impossible…\rIt's burning me up…
Yep, you've finally caught me!\nOr were you trying to avoid me?
Whoop, that was a great match!
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nI hope you enjoyed our performance.
You don't know who I am, do you?\cBut, I also don't know you.\nSo, we'll battle!
You're pretty strong!
Until you go away somewhere, we'll\nkeep on mimicking your every move.
The MIMIC CIRCLE was formed by people\nwho like to MIMIC.\cA battle starts the instant we meet!
I give up!
Won't you join our MIMIC CIRCLE?
Who has the knowledge and\nthe technique for survival?\cPOKéMON RANGERS, that's who!
I didn't have enough POKéMON\nknow-how…
To break away from civilization and\nawaken the wild spirit within!\cThat's our vision.
I hope you'll give me a rematch without\nmocking my lack of knowledge.
I'm going to regain my wild spirit by\nbeing together with POKéMON.
You've remained strong!
Believe in your POKéMON.\nBelieve in yourself.\cThe road will reveal itself to you.
Oh? Look at you.\cFor someone on an adventure,\nyou're traveling awfully light.
Accidents happen when you're not\nprepared!
You're traveling light but you have\neverything you need.\cYou're on top of things mentally and\nphysically, too.
Do you have a POKéNAV?\nIt's a must-have tool for any TRAINER.\cOh, you do have one!\nLet's register each other, then!
How's your journey with POKéMON\ngoing?
I'm still missing something…
In the same way that you, as a TRAINER,\nrely on your POKéMON, your POKéMON\rrely on you.
The vast sky holds untold promise!\cNothing can compare to the sheer\nexhilaration of flight!
Down and out!
My BIRD POKéMON made my dreams of\nflying come true!
I'll show you the true potential of me\nand my BIRD POKéMON!
We lacked potential…
Ever since I was a little kid, I always\nadmired BIRD POKéMON…
To lurk in shadows, and live in\ndarkness… That is my destiny.\cI emerge to challenge you!
I admit defeat!
Those defeated in battle withdraw\nquietly back into the shadows.\rThat, too, is destiny…
If you're not on your guard,\nyou're in for some pain!
You're surprisingly good!
My surprise attack ended in\nfailure…
To hide a tree, use a forest!
I bow to your superiority.
To hide a tree, use a forest!\nTo hide a POKéMON, use a POKéMON!\cThere is no deep, hidden meaning\nto that.
You spoke to me…\nSo you want to challenge me!\cSure! I'll try out the POKéMON I caught\nwhile SURFING!
I don't have a clue about what it\ntakes to win.
Go for a SURF on my POKéMON…\cThen fish off its back…\cIt's an indescribably luxuriant moment!
Hit me with a power chord!\nVictory is mine!\rIt's our time to shine, whoa, yeah!
You showed me who's the boss!\nWe'll have to take the loss, oh, no!
Hit me with another power chord!\nLeave me alone!\rYour win you have to atone!
Hohoho!\nI like kid TRAINERS!\rLet's have a good one!
You're pretty amazing!\nHohoho!
Hohoho!\nI'll try emulating the pep of kid\rTRAINERS like you!
Wherever and whenever I may be,\nI always have my parasol in hand.
Oh, but…\nThat's not fair.
You're asking if my parasol is heavy?\nYour BAG is filled with more junk than\rI ever carry around.
Do you have any moves that can strike\na flying POKéMON?
You soared above me!
The move FLY is convenient,\ndon't you think?\cWhile the POKéMON is flying,\nalmost no moves can strike it.
My POKéMON is strong!\nHow about yours?
Your POKéMON were stronger…
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
You can be counted on to get better.\nI'd like to register you in my POKéNAV!
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
Your POKéMON are seriously strong.
My POKéMON are growing stronger.\nI have to grow stronger, too.
I'll check your POKéMON and see if\nthey're fit for the outdoors.
With POKéMON that strong, you're in\nno danger of needing rescue!
To travel wherever your heart desires\nwith POKéMON…\rThat's the joy of being a TRAINER.
How's your physical fitness?\nIf you're not fit, you could have a\rrough time in critical situations.
I'm totally fit, but…
Fitness training is in my routine.\nI always run with my POKéMON.
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rWant to battle?
Lost it…
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rI'll try harder…
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rDo you have a POKéNAV…?
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rWant to battle again?
… … … … … …\nI lost again…
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rI'll try harder…\rFor my precious BUG POKéMON…
POKéMON have many special abilities.\nIf you want to become a first-class\rTRAINER, learn about them.
You're obviously thinking.
The special abilities of POKéMON\nwill make battle styles change.
Who might you be?\cAre you perhaps searching for ancient\nruins that are rumored to possibly\rexist according to legend?
What a disgraceful setback…
That giant rock… I would like to\nbelieve it may indeed contain ancient\rruins. But I see no entrance.
Why am I carrying this parasol?\cI'll tell you if you can win against me.
A parasol can't ward off POKéMON\nattacks…
I don't think strong sunlight is good\nfor my POKéMON.\rSo I shield them with my parasol.
Me, POKéMON, and my parasol…\cIf any one of them is missing,\nthe picture of beauty will be ruined.
You've completely ruined my beauty…
A parasol wouldn't suit you at all.\cWhy, something like this would only\nget in your way.
I will adopt the movements of POKéMON\nand create new ninja techniques.
The creation of new ninja techniques\nis but a distant dream…
Perhaps I ought to apprentice under\na ninja sensei.
We ninja conceal ourselves under our\ncamouflage cloaks.\rI bet you didn't know where I was!
I lost!\nI should camouflage my shame!
Our camouflage cloaks are all\nhandmade.
If you don't pay attention,\nyou could get hurt!
Ouch!\nI was the one to get hurt.
I wonder… Should I evolve my POKéMON?\nThey're cute the way they are, though.
Your party POKéMON…\nDo you have different types?
I've seen your policy in action!
I think it's awesome you're so strong\nbattling with your favorite POKéMON.
Will you play with my delightfully\npretty POKéMON?
This isn't what I meant!
I'm going to a CONTEST in LILYCOVE.\cMy POKéMON should have no problem\nsweeping the MASTER CLASS.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled\nto the world's four corners.\cYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
I would like to circle the globe once\nagain with my POKéMON.
Your POKéMON prowess is remarkable.\nAllow me to register you as a memento.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled\nto the world's four corners.\cYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
Your POKéMON and you…\cYour prowess together will be\nconsidered strong, even overseas.
There are powers beyond our\nunderstanding in the world…
I have lost…
MT. PYRE…\nThere is a mysterious power\rat work there…
KATE: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!
KATE: I blew it in front of my junior\nstudent partner…
KATE: When someone's relying on me,\nI get this urge to look cool in front\rof them…
KATE: If you've only got one POKéMON,\nwe can't battle with you.\cThat would be bullying.
JOY: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!
JOY: Please forgive me, KATE!
JOY: Ehehe, I'll have to train with KATE,\nmy senior student partner, again.
JOY: You need at least two POKéMON\nif you're going to challenge us!
Stop! Have a good look at my precious\nPOKéMON!
Oh, how dare you!\nDon't take it so seriously!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.
I took it easy on you this time!\nIt won't be that way the next time!
My precious POKéMON grew!\nHave a good look!
Oh, how dare you!\nYou still won't take it easy!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.
I have this routine.\nDefeat five TRAINERS a day.\rGuess what? You're number five!
No!\nYou're horrid!
I didn't expect to lose this easily…\nI'll win next time!
That was total humiliation!\nI won't forget you…\rHand over your POKéNAV!
I have this new routine.\nDefeat ten TRAINERS a day.\rGuess what? You're number ten!
Wait! That's nasty!\nI demand a rematch!
An opponent I just can't beat…\nSnivel…\rI can't believe this is happening…
Can't you see that I have all this\nstuff with me?\cDespite that, you still insist that\nwe battle?
Of course I lost!\nI'm holding stuff in both hands!
I bought too much stuff at\nthe LILYCOVE DEPT. STORE.\cIt's up the road from here.\nI wish I had a BAG like yours.
There's nothing I love more than\nchecking out other people's POKéMON!
Super awesome!
They're great, your POKéMON!\nHow do you raise them?
I want everybody to see the POKéMON\nI've raised!
Wow!\nSpectacular!
I raise every POKéMON with the same\nlove and care--I don't pick favorites.
My POKéMON have never tasted defeat!\nOn their next win, I'm entering them\rin CONTESTS.
Oh, now what happened here?
I may have to train my gang some more\nbefore entering any CONTEST.
Want to determine how strong you are?\nI'll be the test!
You passed with flying colors!
To best even me…\nYour strength is marvelous!
You seem to have a big collection\nof GYM BADGES.\cLet me see if you're actually worthy of\nthose BADGES!
Oh, you're worthy, all right!
You did your BADGES proud in that\nmatch!
They say that good times are filled\nwith good aromas.
Oh…\nI smell the bitter scent of misery…
The BERRY MASTER's garden is filled\nwith uplifting fragrances.
Being a psychic is about willpower.\cI've willed myself not to lose to\nanyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad…
Being a psychic is about willpower.\nI thought I wouldn't lose to you…
I sense it!\nYou and I shall battle again!\rI can't tell if I'll win, though…\cLet's see your POKéNAV.
I've convinced myself that I won't\nlose anymore. That makes me strong!
I feel sad…
I should train at MT. PYRE…\nI'll never beat you this way…
Don't be too happy if your POKéMON\ndevelop psychic powers.\cYou need to refine those powers to\nmake them really useful.
Overwhelmed!
We all have psychic powers.\nWe've just forgotten how to use them.
I would like to face you again.\nIs that okay with you?
Have you awoken the psychic powers\nwithin you?
Astounding!
Your power with POKéMON…\nThat could be a psychic power, too.
MIU: Hello, TRAINER. I hope your\nPOKéMON won't cry when they lose.
MIU: Uh-oh, we lost.
MIU: TRAINER, your POKéMON are\nstrong because you are friends.
MIU: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.
YUKI: Okay!\nWe're beating the TRAINER's POKéMON!
YUKI: Uh-oh, we lost.
YUKI: Why are you so strong?\nWe've never lost before.
YUKI: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.
MT. PYRE…\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep…\rWill your POKéMON sleep?
Overflowing with vitality…
MT. PYRE…\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep…\cIt must overflow with a power that\nsoothes spirits…
I'll turn your lights out while\nI rip through this tune!
Hey, hold it!\nI was still playing the intro!
You're rock steady.\nI'd like to write a tune about you.
The next time, lend your ears to\nthe full tune, will you?
Today's the day I'm going to do it!\nI'll turn out your lights before\rI finish singing my song!
Hey, hold it!\nI haven't even hit the chorus!
I thought you'd be so enthralled\nby my tune, you'd lose.
This is my awesome BUG POKéMON!\nMy big brother got it for me.
Waaaah!\nYou meanie!
Don't tell my brother I lost.\nYou have to keep it a secret!
My confidence will get a boost by\nbeating someone obviously strong!
There goes my confidence…
They say that you can't judge a person\nby their appearance.\cBut often, their looks don't lie…
Hello, child!\nCan you spare some time?
Ah, a mighty capable child!\nLet me contribute to your allowance.
Contribute to your allowance?\nWasn't the prize money enough?
I have to tell you, BIRD POKéMON\nare my obsession!\cBirds are cool!\nThey're the best!
Even in defeat, BIRD POKéMON are cool!
I gather BIRD POKéMON feathers that\nscatter during battles.\cI'm going to make a hat with\nBIRD POKéMON feathers.
When there are no TRAINERS around,\nI let my POKéMON battle each other.\rI watch them.
I kind of like your POKéMON.
Hehe, I'm swiping your battling ideas!\nI think they'll make me better.
I lay in ambush, and a TRAINER has\nlanded in my trap!
If you don't lose, how am I supposed\nto have fun playing ninja?
I'm going to ambush a weaker-looking\nTRAINER next time.
I just bought this parasol.\nMy cuteness should be up by a third!
You're better than me by about\nfive times!
Using accessories effectively is\nthe secret behind fashion appeal.
Hey, are you lost at sea?\cIf you can beat my POKéMON,\nI can serve as your pilot.
I lost my bearings in battle!
Many people lose their bearings at sea.\cIf you're that sort, you should refer\nto the POKéNAV's MAP.
Hm! You're riding a POKéMON instead\nof swimming yourself…\cI am envious!
Oh!\nI can't…
I'm getting chilled…\nI've been in the water too long…\cI wish I could ride a POKéMON like you…
If you just float in the sea like\nthis, POKéMON come around to play.
Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.
While swimming, I noticed that some\nPOKéMON attack, and some just watch.\cI guess POKéMON have personalities\nof their own.
It's only on a whim, but maybe I'll get\nyou to register me in your POKéNAV.
If you just float in the sea like this,\nTRAINERS challenge you!
That's strange…\nI lost again…
This has nothing to do with anything,\nbut maybe I'll visit the TRICK HOUSE.
I'm growing bored of swimming…\nHow about a battle?
I had no idea that you were\nthis strong!
All the effort you put in must have\nmade you this strong.
Fufufufu… I dive deep underwater\nto go deep under cover.\rPlumbing the depths is where I excel!
Glub, glub, glub…\nI'm sinking…
I have it on good authority that\nthere's a DIVE spot around here.\cIt gives me the urge to go deep\nagain…
LILA: Sigh…\cHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\cLet's battle so I won't have to dwell\non that!
LILA: ROY! It's your fault we lost!\nYou're in for it later!
LILA: Sigh…\cIf only it wasn't my little brother\nnext to me, but a nice boyfriend…
LILA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have two POKéMON.
ROY: My big sister is tough at POKéMON!\cDon't cry when you lose!
ROY: Uh-oh…\nMy big sister will chew me out…
ROY: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\cThat's why she doesn't have a\nboyfriend.
ROY: Will you battle with us again?\nBut take it easy next time, okay?
ROY: Did you want to battle us?\nBring two POKéMON, then.
LILA: Sigh…\cHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\cOh, hi, it's been a while. Let's battle\nso I won't have to dwell on things!
LILA: ROY!\nIt's your fault we lost again!\cWe're having a training session later!
LILA: Sigh…\cIf I had a nice boyfriend, we'd beat\nanyone with lovely combinations…
LILA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have two POKéMON.
ROY: If we lose, I'll catch heck.\nI'm going to go totally all out!
ROY: Uh-oh…\nMy big sister will chew me out again.
ROY: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\cShe's going to make me train really\nhard with POKéMON later…
ROY: Did you want to battle us?\nBring two POKéMON, then.
Here I am swimming by my lonesome\non this wide, beautiful sea.\cThere's no other word for it.\nThis is pathetic!
I'm feeling blue.\nBlue as the sky…
I should chat up lady SWIMMERS\nand invite them on a long swim.
I'm not going to lose to some\nsurfer TRAINER.
I've only got sweat in my eyes!\nI am not crying!
You can find pretty colored shards\nof things around here.
I heard you approaching, so I hung\naround for you!
I surrender!
Sound travels faster in water than\nit does through air.
Hey, there!\nCheck out my sweet POKéMON!
I floundered…
I was blown away by HORSEA's charm,\nso I started swimming, too.
I'm tired of swimming.\nAre you up for a battle with me?
You're too much!
Whew…\nWhich way is it to MOSSDEEP CITY?
How would you like to take on the\nWATER-type POKéMON I raised?
Lost it…
Your power… You're the real deal.\nI'm amazed!
Ahoy! I'm a buff, tough SAILOR!\nI've braved the world's seas!
Gwrroooar!\nI couldn't win!
The tide ebbs and flows inside the\nSHOAL CAVE.\cBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Did you know?
Register me in your POKéNAV,\nand I'll tell you something good.
It's high time I get my payback\nfrom you! Come on, we're battling!
I couldn't win!\nI flat out couldn't win!
The SHOAL CAVE…\cThere are places you can and can't\nget to depending on the rise and fall\rof the tide.\cBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Don't forget!
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE. Someone told me.\rAre you going to see him, too?
KIM: I thought we would win.
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE, doesn't he?\cLet's go see him, IRIS!
KIM: No, no, no! You need two POKéMON,\nor it's just no good!
IRIS: KIM, can you tell me what we're\nlooking for out here?
IRIS: Oh, we came sort of close.
IRIS: KIM, are we really going into\nthe SHOAL CAVE?\rWe'll get all wet.
IRIS: Oh, we could never, ever do\nanything like a 2-on-1 battle.
Why would a BIRDKEEPER like me\ncome out to the sea?
Okay.\nI'll tell you why I'm here.
I put a message in a bottle and put\nit out to sea.\cI'm sure that a girl SWIMMER will\nfind it!
Hey! Was it you throwing garbage\ninto the sea?
Oh, you weren't throwing trash into\nthe sea.
I found an unsightly bottle bobbing\nin the waves earlier.\cIt angers me that someone would\npollute the sea!
Swimming is a full-body workout!\nYou will get fit!
I admit it!\nYou win!
Thanks to my daily swimming routine…\nLook! Feast your eyes on this physique!
This towering white mountain of rock\nis SOOTOPOLIS CITY.
I was done in?
I can't find the entrance to\nSOOTOPOLIS. Where could it be?
Ufufufufu!\nI'm a mermaid!
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble!\nBlub, blub, blub…
You thrashed me… I want to\ndisappear in a wave of despair…
Hello, kiddo!\nWant a battle with me?
Oh, noooooh!
I love frolicking with POKéMON in\nthe sea like this!
Check out this sculpted body!\nI'm more cut than a BLACK BELT!
Whoops! Too strong!\nNot bad! Not bad at all!
Losing to you stimulated my senses!\nI'll train myself and POKéMON harder!
Yep, you're not bad at all!\nI'd like to get to know you more!
Check out this beautiful body!\nI'm more shapely than a SWIMMER!
Whoops! Really too strong!\nNot bad! Not bad at all!
I'm going to train even harder!\nYou're a great motivator!\rYou have to come back again!
I couldn't even swim last year,\nbut now I'm a decent SWIMMER.\cI think I'm capable of anything now.
Sheesh, getting greedy didn't do\na thing for me.
If you practice at something,\nyou will get better at it.\cYou're young--don't be afraid to\ntry all sorts of things!
If seawater gets up your nose,\ndoesn't it feel terrible?
Ack! Why, you…\nGlub!
Ooh, I choked on some water!\nIt's bitter! It's salty!!
I'm throwing my whole heart\ninto this!
You had more heart!
I need to cool down now…\nI think I'll go for a dive.
I can see it in your face.\nYou want to challenge me.
Awawawawawa…
A well-played match leaves me feeling\nrefreshed and serene.
Do you have a rival whom you just\nhate to lose against?
Arrrgh!\nI hate losing!
If you have a rival, don't you get the\nfeeling that you have to keep getting\rbetter?
Through fishing, I have attained a\nstate of becalmed serenity…\cPlease, allow me to demonstrate…
Though I have lost, my heart remains\ncalm…
It matters not that I catch nothing.\nThe line remains in the water…
Whoops! Don't tell me I snagged\na SURFING POKéMON?
I can't keep up!
It'd be a handful if I hooked\nyour tough POKéMON!
Well, hey! This is a match between\na POKéMON fan and a fishing buff!
No! My line's all tangled!\nThe party's over!
My fishing line's doing a dance!\nThe tangle tango! Hahaha, snarl!
BIRD POKéMON have excellent vision.\nThey spot prey from great heights.
Whew… I give up.
There're lots of diving spots in\nthe sea around here.\cYou can spot them easily from the sky\nbecause of their darker color.
Run in your bare feet.\nThat will toughen up your soles!
Yowch!\nI got a pebble under a toenail!
Going barefoot feels great.\nBut your RUNNING SHOES are cool, too.
This is what I do to people who beat me!\nI hope we can do this again.
I still run in my bare feet daily.\nMy soles are tough!
Yowch!\nPebbles dug into my arches!
Want to go barefoot for a while?\nSo I can try your RUNNING SHOES?
We should have a slow and methodical\nmatch.
You didn't give me the chance to\ndo any strategizing.
When I'm surrounded by the blue sea\nand sky, it feels as if time slows down.
EVER GRANDE CITY is still a long ways\naway…
My first victory seems to be far\naway, too…
My whole life has been about losing,\nbut I will never give up!
I know I'm not good now, but I think\nI can win eventually.\cPlease register me in your POKéNAV.
I'm still feeling good. I'll keep on\nswimming to EVER GRANDE CITY.
I've yet to taste my first victory…
I'll eventually reach EVER GRANDE CITY\nwhere I can eventually win…
You have to swim, cycle, and then run\na marathon in a triathlon.\cIt's a grueling race that consists\nof three events.
A POKéMON battle is grueling, too…
I have to ride a BIKE next, but…\nI'm about to throw in the towel…
Well, I may as well make the best\nof this. I'd like a rematch sometime.
A triathlon is long. But I guess the\nroad to become the POKéMON CHAMPION\ris also a long and grueling one.
A POKéMON battle really is harsh\nand unforgiving…
You should give serious thought to\nchallenges on VICTORY ROAD.
We've been working so hard to mount\na POKéMON LEAGUE challenge…\cWe can't afford to lose now!
Oh!\nHow could this happen?!
After all I've done to get here,\nI won't give up after one setback.
There is no stronger TRAINER than I!
This can't be!
There probably is no stronger TRAINER\nthan you!
I want to visit EVER GRANDE, so I\ncaught myself a POKéMON that knows\rthe move WATERFALL to crest the falls.
I'm crestfallen!
Awww, phooey!\cMy POKéMON knows WATERFALL, but\nI don't have the SOOTOPOLIS GYM BADGE!
You're looking awfully tough.\nI wonder if I can win?
Ouch!\nI guess it was impossible to win.
There are tough TRAINERS galore\naround EVER GRANDE.\cDo you think I may be out\nof my league?
The sunlight seems to be more harsh\nin this area.
I couldn't see very well because of\nthe sun's glare.
I should go back soon.\nI need to reapply my sunscreen.
This is my first triathlon.\nI'm all tense and nervous!
Wroooaaar!\nI failed to win!
If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to\ngive it my all.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut, sure, why don't we battle?
I was sure I'd win!
Do you know what's the greatest thing\nabout triathlons?\cTesting the limits of your own\nstrength and endurance against\rMother Nature!
Say hey, hey!\nLet's get on with it!
Beat, I'm beaten.\nThat's it, done!
There's nothing for a loser.\nTime for me to beat it home.
What's the hurry?\nLet's take it slow and easy.
Oh, my.\nI wanted to relax a little more…
Don't you hate making mistakes when\nyou're in a rush?\cThat's why I try to take things\nslowly.
Surfing isn't as easy as it seems,\nisn't that right?
Winning sure isn't easy.
You have your sights on the POKéMON\nLEAGUE? Keep at it!
What a surprise! I didn't expect to\nsee a TRAINER out in the sea.\cI think we should battle!
This kid's awfully tough…
Your eyes have that look of someone\nwho's experienced harsh challenges\rand won. It suits you well!
In the deep blue sea,\nmy shattered blue heart finds\rcomfort among waves.
Like the vast blue sea,\nthe world of POKéMON spans\rdepths beyond belief.
The world's children dream\nof one day becoming\rthe POKéMON CHAMPION.
Floating on the open sea like this…\nIt's peaceful.
I needed to be a little less peaceful!
Swimming and battling like this…\nI'm one happy guy…
The sea is teeming with POKéMON.\nIt's not easy swimming, I tell you.
POKéMON raised by TRAINERS are\nseriously tough…
Gasp… Gasp…\nI'm wiped out…\cThe going's easy. It's the leaving\nthat's the hard part.\cWill I have any energy left to make\nthe return trip?
The sea… The sea… The sea…\nThe sea as far as these eyes can see!\rI'm sick and tired of the sea!
Bleah!
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.\cI'm a born swimmer!\nThat's what I am.
Hi, sweetie, wait!\nWe should battle, you and I!
You're tough in spite of the way\nyou look!
Did you see a guy over there who whines\nthat he's bored of the sea?\cThat's all talk.\nHe's hopelessly in love with the sea!
Why do men love bathing suits so much?\cThey all ogle me!
I'm out of my depth!
Maybe it's not my bathing suit that\nmakes men look. It must be my beauty!
RELI: We'll work together as siblings\nto take you on!
RELI: We couldn't win even though we\nworked together…
RELI: The people of PACIFIDLOG are\ntogether with the sea and POKéMON from\rthe time they are born.
RELI: You don't have two POKéMON?\nWe can't enjoy a battle, then.
IAN: I'm doing my best together with\nmy sis!
IAN: I did my best with my sis,\nbut we still couldn't win…
IAN: You know how PACIFIDLOG is\na floating town?\cSo, wherever there is the sea,\nthat's a part of PACIFIDLOG!
IAN: If you have two POKéMON,\nwe'll take you on!
If you can beat me, I'll give you some\ngreat information!
Oh?\nDid I lose?
There is an odd place nearby.\nThere's a huge tower there.\rWhy don't you go take a look?
The people of PACIFIDLOG are\na peaceful bunch.\cThey never get angry.\nThat goes for me, too.
Oops!
Tch! …Oh, wait.\nI'm not angry. Honestly!\cBut, boy, you're strong!\nHahaha!
I used to catch colds all the time as\na kid, but I became totally fit after\rI started swimming.
I crave more power…
TRAINERS travel the fields and\nmountains, so they must be fit, too.
I try not to swim where the currents\nare too strong.
Oh, please, no!
If I get swept away, I'll lose all my\nsense of place…
Win or lose, you'll never know until\nyou try!
Waah!\nI sank in defeat!
I never battle when I know I'll win.\nI like to battle at the razor's edge of\rvictory and defeat!
I contemplate POKéMON 24 hours a day.\nHow could you possibly beat me?
I lose.\nI will concede defeat.
Urggh…\nYou're a POKéMON fanatic, aren't you?\cYou must contemplate POKéMON 24 hours\na day, don't you?
I'm always with my husband,\nbut I can win even without him.
Oh, I guess I wasn't good enough.
That young man over there looks just\nlike my husband when he was young.\cHe's making me blush!
Someone's been watching me intently.\nWas it you?
Wow!\nThat's pretty strong, all right!
I can't shake this feeling that\nsomeone's watching me.\cI can't concentrate!
Now where could my wife have gone?\nI'm always with her.\rI wonder if I can win on my own.
Ah, I see that I couldn't manage\nto win on my own after all.
My wife must be looking for me.\nI'd best go find her right away.
I liked training here by myself.\nIt's awful that all these people came!
Okay! I won't complain about other\npeople being here.
I suppose I can partner up with that\nold man and challenge that other team.
Did the currents carry you here, too?\nThis must have been fated.\rLet's battle!
Strong!\nToo much so!
It's just my luck that a tough TRAINER\nlike you would drift here…\rI must be cursed…
I've led a life of woe and misery…\nI've been cast away, and this is where\rI've drifted…
Another loss…
A life adrift…\nI don't want it anymore!
Welcome!\nI've been expecting you!
No! Please!
A strong child TRAINER…\nThat's so annoying!
I want to win like everyone else, but I\nwon't raise POKéMON like everyone else.
Darn it!\nMy way is still too slack!
It's way more fun to do things the way\nI want than to be like everybody else.\rI mean, that's obvious!
I came all the way out here with my\nBIRD POKéMON.
You…\nYou're stunningly cool!
I'd like to go back to FORTREE,\nbut I've grown to like this place, too.
I must have battled thousands\nof times. I've lost count.
I may have lost thousands of times,\nbut a loss still stings.
Keep at this, youngster. So you can\nbecome like my husband and me.
Young people are too happy to go with\nthe flow. They're without direction.
You have a firm sense of purpose.
Don't let others lead you astray.\nDon't lose direction as you grow older.
Even those POKéMON that can swim are\ncarried along by the rapid currents.
Aiyeeeeh!
I think POKéMON enjoy the fast-running\ncurrents around these parts.
My LUVDISC are looking for a fun\nmatch. Will you join us?
Oopsie!
There's a collector who's after\nthe SCALES of LUVDISC.
Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang!\nIt's time for a match!
Tuckered out again…
My BIRD POKéMON get tired quickly after\na long flight…
You're a POKéMON TRAINER.\nNo need for words. We battle now.
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …
It was I who challenged you, and yet\nI lost. I am deeply shamed…
The savage tide in this area serves to\nmake us stronger than ever.
I willingly concede defeat.
We will return for more training at\nMETEOR FALLS.\cIf you'd like, you should go, too.\nIt will definitely toughen you up!
O-our boat!\nThe tide carried it away!
Awawawawah!\nPlease, stop! Please!
If we can't SURF, how are we supposed\nto get home?\cActually, I know a fainted POKéMON\ncan still SURF, but it feels wrong.
Can your POKéMON dodge our\nlightning-quick attacks?
I never knew such a technique existed!\nYou've defeated us thoroughly.
I haven't lost my passion for speed.\nI will try harder.
My POKéMON can't be taken down\neasily!
You're kidding!\nExplain how I lost!
Haha!\nYou won, all right!\cI'll work my way back up by taking on\nTRAINERS I happen to meet!
Listen, have you seen another SAILOR\naround here?
Now, that's something!
Our boat drifted out to sea.\cMy buddy's a timid fellow, so I'm\nworried about him.
REPEL's effect wore off…
Would you like to exit the SAFARI\nZONE right now?
Ding-dong! Time's up!\nYour SAFARI Game is over.
You've run out of SAFARI BALLS.\nYour SAFARI Game is over.
Would you like to place a [POKEBLOCK]\non the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER?
The [STR_VAR_1] you left\nbefore is still here.
The [STR_VAR_1] was placed\non the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER.
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\cHere, you may witness many kinds of\nPOKéMON rarely seen in HOENN.\cAnd, you'll see them in their wild,\nuntamed state in natural habitats.\cWhat's more, we've thrown open the\ngates to POKéMON TRAINERS.\cYou're encouraged to catch POKéMON\nfor keeps!\cCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\nIs it your first time here?
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
When you enter the SAFARI ZONE, you\nstart with 30 SAFARI BALLS for\rcatching POKéMON.\cThe SAFARI Game is over when you run\nout of SAFARI BALLS, or when you've\rwalked 500 steps.\cCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\cAll you can catch for just $500!\nWould you like to play a SAFARI Game?
Okay.\nPlease play another time!
You don't have enough money.\nSorry.
That will be $500, please.
Here are your SAFARI BALLS.
[PLAYER] received 30 SAFARI BALLS.
We'll let you know when your game\nis over.\cSo, until then, enjoy yourself, please!\nOff you go on your wild excursion!
Excuse me!\nYour PC BOX is full.
Excuse me!\nYou seem to be without a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYour SAFARI Game will be much more\nfruitful if you use [POKEBLOCK]S.\cPlease come back with a [POKEBLOCK] CASE.\cYou may obtain a [POKEBLOCK] CASE from\nthe LILYCOVE CONTEST HALL.
You still have time left. Would you like\nto exit the SAFARI ZONE now?
Please enjoy the rest of your wild\nadventure!
Okay.\cI'll take back your remaining SAFARI\nBALLS.\cThank you for playing.\nWe hope to see you again.
Good luck!\cIf you need anything, don't hesitate\nto tell me, please!
Did you know?\cIf you put a [POKEBLOCK] in that square box,\nPOKéMON gather around.
I want to keep going deeper, but I\nforgot to bring a BIKE.\cSomething tells me that rare POKéMON\nlive in the outlying areas.
Sometimes, when I toss a [POKEBLOCK] at \nPOKéMON, it gets ignored.\cDo POKéMON have likes and dislikes\nabout what they eat?
Gasp… Gasp…\nI…made it out here…but…\cI'm exhausted… I don't have the\nenergy to catch POKéMON…
I'm on a mission to find WATER POKéMON\nyou don't see in HOENN.\cDo you have any idea where the lake is?
I'm going to catch a lot of rare POKéMON\nhere and trade them with my friends!
I put a [POKEBLOCK] on the [POKEBLOCK] FEEDER.\nBut it seems to have disappeared.\cI guess POKéMON must have eaten it\nwithout me noticing.
SAFARI ZONE TRAINER TIP!\cThrow [POKEBLOCK]S at wild POKéMON to make\nthem less likely to flee.
“Relieve your tired feet.”\nREST HOUSE
I don't have any [POKEBLOCK]S, but I caught\na good number of POKéMON.\cYou can improve your chances of making\na catch by getting closer to them\rbefore throwing a SAFARI BALL.
If you use [POKEBLOCK]S, wild POKéMON won't\nbe so quick to run away.\cIt's not much use to give [POKEBLOCK]S to\nPOKéMON that don't flee easily.
If you put a [POKEBLOCK] on the FEEDER,\nPOKéMON are attracted to it.\cI think POKéMON with the same sort of\nnature are drawn by a certain [POKEBLOCK].
This area is still under construction.\nIt's off-limits, sorry!
The SAFARI ZONE's expansion project\nis finished now.\cWe hope you will enjoy the new area.
This area is still under construction.\nIt's off-limits, sorry!
Wow! Whee! I haven't seen any of\nthese POKéMON before!
The POKéMON in this area are all\nnew to me.\cAnd I'm allowed to catch these rare\nPOKéMON! Too cool!
The POKéMON around here seem to be\nfrom somewhere other than HOENN.
I only have a couple SAFARI BALLS left.\cI'm having a hard time trying to\ndecide what I should catch.
I heard that you can see PIKACHU here.\nWhere might one be?
Oh, boo!\nI can't seem to catch anything!\cI'll end up wasting the admission\nprice if I don't catch something!
The minimum wager at this table\nis [STR_VAR_1]. Do you want to play?
You don't have enough COINS.
Special rate table right now!
Place your wager with the + Control\nPad, then press the A Button.
It's a hit!
Jackpot!
Nothing doing!
You've won [STR_VAR_1] COINS!
No COINS left…
Keep playing?
The ROULETTE board will be cleared.
You don't have a COIN CASE.
Your COIN CASE is full!\nCoins can be exchanged for prizes.
PROF. BIRCH: Ah, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cAre you curious about how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along?
Hm? Oh, you haven't caught enough\nPOKéMON to make it worthwhile.
Hmhm…\cSo, you've seen [STR_VAR_1] POKéMON,\nand you've caught [STR_VAR_2] POKéMON…
Go into grassy areas more and look\nfor POKéMON more carefully.
I guess you're getting the hang\nof it. But, it gets harder from here.
Some POKéMON only appear in\ncertain areas.\rYou must be persistent.
Well, it could use more quantity,\nbut this is looking more like\ra POKéDEX now.
This is coming along pretty good.\nKeep up the effort.
Are you using any RODS?\nThere are many POKéMON in the sea.
Instead of just catching POKéMON,\nhow about making them evolve, too?
This is going to be a fantastic\nPOKéDEX.\rThat's the feeling I'm getting.
You've collected this many…\nYour talent is remarkable!
Have you visited the SAFARI ZONE?\cI hear there are some POKéMON that\ncan only be caught there.
You've finally reached\nthe 100-kind mark.\cThis is an impressive POKéDEX!
There might be POKéMON that can be\nfound using ROCK SMASH.
You should get some more POKéMON\nby trading with others.
I've heard of POKéMON that evolve\nwhen they come to fully love their\rTRAINERS.
I had no idea that there were so\nmany POKéMON species in the HOENN\rregion.
On occasion, some POKéMON appear\nin large numbers like outbreaks.\cDon't miss opportunities like\nthose.
One can get a very good idea about\nthe POKéMON of the HOENN region\rby looking through your POKéDEX.
I would say you already qualify as\na POKéMON PROFESSOR, and a good\rone, too!
With a POKéDEX this complete,\nyou're a real professional at this!
You're very close to completing\nthis POKéDEX.\rI can feel it in my bones!
Congratulations!\nYour POKéDEX is complete!
Hmhm…\nOn a nationwide basis…\cYou've seen [STR_VAR_1] POKéMON,\nand you've caught [STR_VAR_2] POKéMON…
This is the POKéMON LOTTERY CORNER.\cAll shoppers at our DEPARTMENT STORE\nget to draw a POKéMON LOTO TICKET.\cIf the LOTO TICKET's number matches\nthe ID number of any of your POKéMON,\ryou will receive a fabulous gift.\cWould you like to draw a POKéMON\nLOTO TICKET?
Please come back tomorrow.
Please do visit again.
Please pick a LOTO TICKET.\n…[PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15]…[PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15]…[PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15][PAUSE 15]
The LOTO TICKET number is [STR_VAR_1].\cI need to run a check on this number\nto see if it matches any of your\rPOKéMON's ID numbers. Please wait.
Congratulations!\cThe ID number of your team's\n[STR_VAR_1] matches your\rLOTO TICKET's number!
Congratulations!\cThe ID number of your PC-boxed\n[STR_VAR_1] matches your\rLOTO TICKET's number!
I'm sorry.\nNone of the numbers matched.
Two digits matched, so you win the\nthird prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Three digits matched, so you win the\nsecond prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Four digits matched, so you win the\nfirst prize!\rYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Oh, my goodness, all five digits\nmatched!\cYou've won the jackpot prize!\nYou've won the [STR_VAR_1]!
Oh?\nYou seem to have no room for this.\cPlease make room in your BAG and\nlet me know.
[PLAYER]?\nYes, I've been expecting you.\cThis is the prize we've been holding\nfor you.
Please do visit again.
The ferry to SLATEPORT is…\cI beg your pardon?\nCan we sail to this place on the map?\cI know someone who will help you better.\nPlease wait.
The ferry to SLATEPORT is…\cOh?\nThat PASS…
Aye, mate, are you the one who brought\nthat mighty odd PASS?\cI'll tell you, you're trying to reach a\ntiny spit of an island far in the south.\cThere's no telling what we'll encounter\nonce we reach there, aye.\rThat shivers my timbers!\cAll aboard!
Aye, mate, there's nothing here to\nsee or do on this forgettable island.\cWhat say we sail back to LILYCOVE?
Aye, right, then!\nSail home we will!
Aye, right, as you like, then.

DAD: Hi, [PLAYER]!\cI just received a very rare BERRY.\nI'd like you to have it.
If you see BERRIES growing in loamy\nsoil, feel free to take them.\cBut make sure you plant a BERRY in the\nsame spot. That's common courtesy.\cHere, I'll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a\nTRAINER, no?\cTRAINERS often make POKéMON hold\nBERRIES.\cIt's up to you whether to grow BERRIES\nor use them.
I watered the plants every day.\nThey grew lots of flowers.\cAnd they gave me lots of BERRIES, too.\cHere you go!\nYou can have it!
I'm going to try really hard and make\nBERRIES in different colors.\cI hope you try hard, too!
I wonder what color BERRIES I'll look\nfor today?
I love using the BERRY CRUSH machine,\nso I'm collecting BERRIES.\cI'll share one with you, if you'd like.
You should try the BERRY CRUSH\nmachine with your friends.
Which BERRY should be planted?\nShould you use or hoard BERRIES?\cIt's fun to think about.
BERRIES grow by soaking up sunlight.\cWe help the BERRIES grow by watering\nthem regularly.\cIt's an expression of love, isn't it?
Yes, yes.\nYou understand what I mean.\cYou should take this.
Oh… But it is important to make your\nown impressions, I guess…\cYou can have this.
I think that BERRY is rare.\nI hope you raise it with loving care.
I'll get more BERRIES from\nthe BERRY MASTER.
When it gets right down to it…\cThe same way suits suit me perfectly,\na crisp breeze suits the sea.\cAnd you, a BERRY suits you to a “T”…\cWhy should that be so?
When it gets right down to it…\cIt's because you're a TRAINER!
When it gets right down to it…\cThe way dignified simplicity suits me,\n[POKEBLOCK]S perfectly suit POKéMON.
You may call me the BERRY MASTER.\cI dream of filling the world with\nbeautiful flowers, so I raise BERRIES\rand hand them out to everyone.\cYou're deserving of one!
Why be stingy?\nTake another!
Be sure to visit the PRETTY PETAL\nflower shop near RUSTBORO.\cLet flowers fill the world!
I'm done for today.\nCome again another day.\cLet flowers fill the world!
The way my husband grows BERRIES,\noh, he's the best in the world.\cHe makes me proud, that he does.\cIncidentally, child, have you heard\na good saying lately?
Ah! What a remarkable saying!\nInspirational, it is!\cI want you to have this.
Oh! A good saying it is.\nYou're quite remarkable.\cI want you to have this.
Our four grandchildren should become\nmore accomplished than my husband.\cJoy never goes out of my life!
Ah…
Hello!\cThis is the PRETTY PETAL flower shop.\nSpreading flowers all over the world!
[PLAYER][KUN], would you like to learn about\nBERRIES?
Your name is?\c[PLAYER][KUN].\nThat's a nice name.\c[PLAYER][KUN], would you like to learn about\nBERRIES?
BERRIES grow on trees that thrive\nonly in soft, loamy soil.\cIf you take some BERRIES, be sure to\nplant one in the loamy soil again.\cA planted BERRY will soon sprout,\ngrow into a plant, flower beautifully,\rthen grow BERRIES again.\cI want to see the whole wide world\nfilled with beautiful flowers.\rThat's my dream.\cPlease help me, [PLAYER][KUN]. Plant BERRIES\nand bring more flowers into the world.
Flowers bring so much happiness to\npeople, don't they?
Hello!\cThe more attention you give to flowers,\nthe more beautifully they bloom.\cYou'll like tending flowers. I'm sure\nof it. You can have this.
While BERRY plants are growing,\nwater them with the WAILMER PAIL.\cOh, another thing.\cIf you don't pick BERRIES for a while,\nthey'll drop off onto the ground.\rBut they'll sprout again.\cIsn't that awesome?\nIt's like they have the will to live.
I'm trying to be like my big sisters.\nI'm growing flowers, too!\cHere you go!\nIt's for you!
You can plant a BERRY and grow it big,\nor you can make a POKéMON hold it.\cBut now they have a machine that mixes\nup different BERRIES and makes candies\rfor POKéMON.\cI want some candy, too.
Hi, what's your name?\c… … …  … … …  … … …\nOkay. That's nice!\cMy name is KIRI.\cMy mommy and daddy named me that so\nI would grow healthy and warmhearted.\rThat's what they wished.\cYou can have one of these.
KIRI will give you this BERRY, too!\nI really like it lots!
I wonder what kind of wish is included\nin your name.
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\cIf you're born in springtime, do you like\nthe spring, and if you're born in the\rsummer, do you like the summer?
Then KIRI was born in the autumn,\nso I love the autumn!\cWhich season do you like?
Oh…\nIt doesn't matter…\cThere's so much that I want to know…
Are you planning on going deep\nin there?\cHow about bringing me back some\nSHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS?\cI can make you something good if\nyou bring me the ingredients.
If you bring me four each of the\nSHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS,\rI can make you a SHELL BELL…\cYou can get those ingredients\nevery day.
Oh, hey! SHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS!\nAnd enough of them, too!\cWould you like me to make you\na SHELL BELL with them?
All righty, then! I'll make you\na SHELL BELL right away.\c… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\cThere! Done!
Have a POKéMON hold on to that.\nIt'll love it, that's for certain.\cWhy, the SHELL BELL's chime…\nIt's simply sublime!\cYou can get its ingredients every day,\nso I can make you more.
Oh… Is that so…\nI wanted to make a SHELL BELL…
You don't have space in your BAG\nif I were to make it for you.\cYou should make room and come back\nfor a SHELL BELL.
There was some SHOAL SALT here.\nBut, there's nothing here now.
There was a SHOAL SHELL here.\nBut, there's nothing here now.
There's a set of POKéMON picture books.
It's filled with all sorts of books.
POKéMON magazines!\nPOKéMON PAL…\cPOKéMON HANDBOOK…\nADORABLE POKéMON…
This vase looks expensive…\nPeered inside…\cBut, it was empty.
It's empty.
The shelves brim with all sorts of\nPOKéMON merchandise.
A blueprint of some sort?\nIt's too complicated!
I'm the FAVOR LADY…
I've recently developed an obsession\nfor [STR_VAR_1] things…
Oh…\nThank you for last time…
Before, I think it was [STR_VAR_3]…\c[STR_VAR_3] gave me one [STR_VAR_2],\nsaying it was [STR_VAR_1].\cBut it wasn't [STR_VAR_1].\nNot in the least bit.
Before, [STR_VAR_3] gave me a very\n[STR_VAR_1] [STR_VAR_2].\cI cherish it now.
Listen, if you have anything that\nis [STR_VAR_1], will you share it\rwith me?
…Really?\nWhat will you give me?
Is that so?\nThen, it's good-bye…
Oh…\nYou're not willing to share?
Oh?\nThat [STR_VAR_2] is [STR_VAR_1]?\c…Oh, is that right?\cWell, I owe you a thanks anyway.\nI'll try to cherish it…
Oh…\cThat's a quite [STR_VAR_1]\n[STR_VAR_2]…\cIsn't it nice?\nIt's so dreamy…\cThank you…\nI will cherish this…
…Oh, oh, oh…\cThis is amazing!\nThis really is [STR_VAR_1]!\cI never knew that one [STR_VAR_2]\ncould be this [STR_VAR_1]!\cThank you!\cI will treasure this for the rest\nof my life!
I'll give you this wonderful item in\nreturn for your fabulous gift.\cI hope you will cherish it…
Oh, you can't have it if you don't have\nthe space for it.\cPlease come see me when you get\nyour BAG organized…
I'm the QUIZ LADY!\nI love quizzes!
Oh?\cI'm waiting for a challenger to answer\nthe quiz you made.\cWe can chat another time, okay?
I'm waiting for someone to challenge\na quiz this [STR_VAR_1] thought up!
If you answer correctly, you can win\nfabulous prizes!\cWould you like to take the quiz\nchallenge?
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …
Oh, how boring!\nBye-bye!
Awww!\nYou're going to quit?
Please take the quiz challenge\nanother time!
You're amazing! You've got it right!\nYou're one sharp customer!
Congratulations!\nYou've got the quiz right!\cYou've won a prize provided by\n[STR_VAR_1]!
[STR_VAR_1] received\none [STR_VAR_2]!
Oh? Your BAG is filled up!\nCome see me when you have room.
Hmm… Wrong!\nThe correct answer is “[STR_VAR_3]”!
Too bad!\cI get to keep the quiz prize\n[STR_VAR_1] now!
Listen, listen!\nWould you like to make your own quiz?
Oh, I see…\nWell, maybe next time!
Okay, the first thing you have to do\nis pick the prize for the person that\ranswers your quiz correctly.\cBut beware, if the person taking\nthe quiz can't get it right, I get to\rkeep the prize!
If you don't choose a prize,\nyour quiz can't be made.\cAre you going to quit making\nyour quiz?
Oh, how nice!\nThat's a wonderful prize!\cNext, you need to write your quiz\nquestion and its answer.
Are you going to quit writing\nyour quiz question?
Are you going to quit choosing\nyour quiz answer?
Thank you!\nYou've put together a nice quiz.\cI'll go look for someone who'll take\nyour quiz challenge right away.
I'm the CONTEST LADY!\nI sure do love CONTESTS!
Thanks for your [POKEBLOCK] before!
This is my friend [STR_VAR_1]!\nIt's the epitome of [STR_VAR_2]!\cBut I think that it will display\neven more [STR_VAR_2]!
So, I need your help!\cPlease, may I have one [POKEBLOCK]?\nAll I'm asking for is one!\c…Oh, but…\nDon't you have a [POKEBLOCK] CASE?\rThat's no good. Next time, then!
So, I need your help!\cPlease, may I have one [POKEBLOCK]?\nAll I'm asking for is one!
Awww!\nI can't have one [POKEBLOCK]?!
Sheesh!\nWhat a cheapskate!
Yay!\nThank you!\cI'll feed my POKéMON your [POKEBLOCK]\nright away.
…It doesn't seem to have changed\nin any way at all…\cHmm…\cOh, well!\nThank you very much!
Oh, yay!\nIt's really delighted!\cI think it really improved [STR_VAR_1]'s\n[STR_VAR_2] quality, too.\cThank you so much!
Hmm…\cI think we may be ready to enter\nsome CONTESTS.\cIf you see us in one somewhere,\nI hope you'll cheer for us.
[STR_VAR_1]: Guguuh!
[STR_VAR_1]: Igigigiiih!
[STR_VAR_1]: Baaarun…
[STR_VAR_1]: Pikka!
[STR_VAR_1]: Umyaaaan!
Hi! [PLAYER][KUN], hello!\nThis is [STR_VAR_1].\cI saw this [STR_VAR_2] a while back\nbut I couldn't catch it.\cIt was so close, too!\nWell, see you again!
Hello, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIt's [STR_VAR_1].\cI tried to catch a nice [STR_VAR_2]\na little while ago.\cBut, it got away.\nI was sure disappointed!\cOkay, bye!
Hey there, [PLAYER]!\nIt's me, [STR_VAR_1].\cI just took a shot at catching\nthis [STR_VAR_2], but it took off.\cI came oh so close, too!\cIt spoiled my day…\nAll right, see you!
Hey, [PLAYER][KUN].\n[STR_VAR_1] here.\cYou know the POKéMON [STR_VAR_2]?\nI came close to getting one.\cIt was just a while back.\nI thought I had it but it escaped.\cIf I see it again, I'll get it for\nsure, though.\cOkay, catch you later.

Hello, this is [STR_VAR_1]…\cI've grown a little jaded with this\nwhole COOLTRAINER thing…\cEveryone thinks I'm a perfect\nTRAINER, and that makes me try to\rlive up to that expectation.\cBut I guess that goes with being\na COOLTRAINER.\cI'll just have to buckle down…\nand grin and bear it.\cYou're the only person that I could\nconfide in like this.\cBut when I see you next,\ndon't worry, I won't whine!
Yahoo, it's [STR_VAR_1]!\nHow do you do?\cI've been raising my POKéMON with\nyou as the target.\cI don't intend to lose when we\nbattle again.\cIsn't it great to have TRAINER\nfriends? Let's meet again!
It's [STR_VAR_1]…\nRight now, behind you…\rWasn't there something…?\cThe power of the POKéMON that\nsleep here at MT. PYRE…\cIt's telling me about you…\cYou should walk away quickly and\nnever once look back…\cGiggle…\nFarewell…
This is [STR_VAR_1].\nHow do you do?\cIsn't it convenient that we can\nchat like this at a distance?\cBefore, if I wanted to speak with\nanyone, I had to have my father\rdrive me…\cI should be going now.\nI'm glad we had this chat.
It's [STR_VAR_1]!\nWill you listen to this?\cI like the SAFARI ZONE a lot,\nbut whenever I go, I get lost!\cAll that tall grass!\nAnd it's much too spread out!\cI feel better getting that off\nmy chest!\cI'm off to the SAFARI ZONE again!\nCatch you!

Oh, it's [STR_VAR_1]!\cI was just thinking I'm getting\nbored of the ABANDONED SHIP.\cBut since I'm already here,\nand I want to beat you once,\rI'll be sticking around a bit more.\cIf you feel compelled, why don't\nyou come see me?\cI think today will be the day that\nI finally challenge the man next\rdoor to a match.\cBe seeing you!
I'm [STR_VAR_1]!\nThe man of the sea!\cYou know what I think?\cThe TRAINERS out at sea are\nthe toughest of the tough!\cYou should learn from me and train\nin the sea…\cWhoops, giant surf rising!\cIt's a great training opportunity!\nSorry, but I have to go!
It's [STR_VAR_1]! Listen, I've been\nteaching karate to my POKéMON.\cBut now they're better than me!\nI've done nothing but lose to them!\cBut even though I may lose to\nPOKéMON, I won't lose to another\rTRAINER, no sir!\cWe have to battle again!\nUgwaah!
It's me, [STR_VAR_1].\nHow're your travels unwinding?\c…Whoa, is that right?\nSounds awfully stimulating!\cI think I could write a song about\none of your episodes.\c…Oh, hey, I'm feeling it.\nI hear the riffs in my head.\cI'd better get this tune properly\nwritten, so I've got to fly! Later!
This is [STR_VAR_1]…\nHear my new song.\cLalala, [STR_VAR_2], [STR_VAR_2]!\nWhy are you that [STR_VAR_2]?\rWhy can't I be you, [STR_VAR_2]?\rLala, [STR_VAR_2] and [STR_VAR_1],\r[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2]…\cRepeat chorus, fade…
I'm [STR_VAR_1], you know,\nthe camping expert!\cWhen we battled, I couldn't help\nbut lose to you.\cAfter all, my expertise is in\ncamping.\cBut win or lose, I like to battle\nwhen I'm camping.\cBattle with us again, okay?\nOh, and let's go camping, too!
It's me, me, [STR_VAR_1]!\cI'd like to climb other mountains\nthan this one, to be honest.\cBut I'm not sure if there'd be any\nladies like on MT. CHIMNEY.\cIf you know any other mountain\nwith ladies around, let me know!\cEhehehe, see you around!
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rIt's [STR_VAR_1]…\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\rThat's all today…

Hello, this is [STR_VAR_1].\nYou sound well, [PLAYER][KUN].\cI've traveled around the world,\nbut I must say I've taken a great\rshine to this region.\cI plan to stay here a while.\nPerhaps we can meet again?\cI've not forgotten your dazzling\ntechniques.\cI do hope for a rematch.
Snivel… It's… [STR_VAR_1]…\n…Sob…\cROXANNE chewed me out in class\ntoday.\cBut I don't dislike her or anything.\cROXANNE tells me exactly what\nI did wrong so I can learn from it.\cYou bet I'll be going to\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL tomorrow!\cSee you later!
It's [STR_VAR_1]!\cROXANNE let me battle with her\nyesterday.\cThe results…\nTerrible, like you needed to ask.\cBut I was delighted that ROXANNE\nwould even let me challenge her!\cYou wouldn't believe how much\nmore I admire her!\cI'm going to really focus and work!\nI'd better go!
Hi, it's ANNA! I'm with my junior\npartner MEG again today.\cI really love caring for MEG and\nPOKéMON. They're so cute!\cI wish I could look after them\nas if they were my siblings!\cOh, hi, MEG!\nDid you get the buns?\cHuh?

I am… [STR_VAR_1].\nPeople call me an EXPERT.\cBut there is one thing I know.\nI could not be an EXPERT on my own\rpower.\cOnly with the help of POKéMON can\na TRAINER become an EXPERT.\cHumph! I believe I may have said\nsomething deep and profound!\cI shall leave you in good spirits!
It's [STR_VAR_1].\nI'm glad to chat with you!\cI am feeling alive and refreshed\nsoaking in this hot-spring tub.\cI've been battling young TRAINERS\nsince we met, but you're still\rthe best of the lot.\cI imagine you'll become an EXPERT\nin your old age! Ohohoho…
Yay! This is [STR_VAR_1]!\nWhat's up?\cI might be imagining this, but when\nI win battles, my shorts seem to\rfeel, like, better. Materially.\cWhat do I mean by that?\nIt's kind of hard to explain, but…\rHow would I say this now…\rMy shorts feel silkier!\cAnd when I battled you, [PLAYER][KUN],\nmy shorts felt icky and coarse.\c… … … … … …\nYou didn't really believe that?\rEhehehe, that's all! Bye now!
Ahoy!\n[STR_VAR_1] here!\cAs always, I'm fishing with wild\nabandon!\cAre there other places I can fish\nthan the sea and rivers?\cI get these powerful urges to\nfish just about anywhere!\cOh, gosh, darn it!\nMy line's tangled up!\cGotta go!\nFind me some new fishing spots!
Hey, there! It's [STR_VAR_1].\nAre you taking it casually?\cEver since I was a kid, you know,\nI've always been placid, huh?\cI never was much for getting all\nstressed or rushing things.\cBut wouldn't you know it,\nI'm now a TRIATHLETE.\cYou just can't tell where life will\ntake you, if you get my drift.\cYou're a TRAINER now, but who\nknows what the future holds, huh?\cImagine yourself as a teacher,\nor maybe an artist. Cool, huh?\cBut, hey, be cool. Take it casual.\nSee you around.
This is [STR_VAR_1]!\nI'm cycling right now.\cI love swimming and running,\nbut cycling is my first love!\cIt makes my whole body feel as if\nI'm one with the wind.\cIt exhilarates me as if I were\nflying!\cOkay!

Yo, this is [STR_VAR_1]! I'm smack\nin the middle of a triathlon!\cBut, hey, I've always got time to\nshoot the breeze!\cWorking out with POKéMON feels\nmighty good!\cWithout exchanging words, we synch\nas if we shared a heart.\cIt's inspiring!\cGasp… Chatting while running…\nI'm getting run down…\rGasp… Have…to…go…
Hi, it's [STR_VAR_1].\nIf you want to improve endurance,\rhigh-altitude training is it!\cTry running on a mountaintop.\nYou'll be gasping in no time!\cI'm getting oxygen starved, too!\nSee you!
Oh, it's [STR_VAR_1], hello.\cI've been swimming a lot but I still\ncan't seem to reach EVERGRANDE.\cMaybe I'm just going in circles.\cNo, no, that can't be possible.\nWahahaha.\rTake care!
Hey, it's [STR_VAR_1]…\nWhoops!\cSplash!\cBlug-blug-blug-blug…\cSploosh!\cWhiff-whiff! Whiff-whiff!\cHey! Sorry about that!\nI just put on some suntan oil.\cSo my POKéNAV went whoopsy\nout of my hand into the water!\cBut, boy, DEVON's POKéNAV is built\ntough. It survived that dunking!\cAnyways, I'm busy sunbathing,\nso let's chat another time.
Hello, this is [STR_VAR_1].\cOut of the three triathlon events,\nI like swimming best.\cBut if I stay in the sea too long,\nwon't I get all prune-like?\cOoh, triathlon is such a grueling\ntest of human endurance! Bye!
Hello, [PLAYER][KUN].\n[STR_VAR_1] here.\cHow are your POKéMON doing?\cMy DRAGON POKéMON appear to be\nin peak form. Bye for now.
[STR_VAR_1] here.\cMy [STR_VAR_2] has grown even more\ntough than that last time.\cI'm not going to lose again to you.\nYou wait till next time!\cSee you around!
It is [STR_VAR_1] here.\cI have continued with my studies\nin the art of concealment.\cBut I have been too successful.\nNo one has been able to find me.\rMy success makes me lonely…\cLike smoke I disappear!\nFarewell!
This is [STR_VAR_1].\nI kept up my training since we met.\cMy [STR_VAR_2] is getting pretty\ntough.\cTraining on a beach is effective,\njust as I thought. Bye now!
How do you do?\nThis is [STR_VAR_1].\cI wonder when this yucky volcanic\nash will stop falling?\cIf it gets too deep, it will cover\nup the pattern on my parasol…\cLet's promise to meet again!
Hi, [STR_VAR_1] here.\cDid you know that it's easier to\nfloat in the sea than a pool?\cJust by lying still, your body will\nfloat on its own.\cBut if you float for too long,\nwatch that you don't get carried\roff too far out.\c…Where am I, anyway?\nI'd better go!
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN], hello!\nThis is [STR_VAR_1].\rI'm up in the mountains now.\cBut the ground is too bumpy.\nI can't pitch my tent here…\cOh, I had a brilliant idea!\cMaybe I can get my POKéMON to tamp\nthe ground flat here!\cI'm going to try that!\nBye-bye!
Oh, hi, hi, this is [STR_VAR_1]!\cI'm raising POKéMON with LIV!\nWe're trying very hard!\cIf we try harder, can we become\nnumber one? Bye-bye!
[STR_VAR_1] here!\cI'm a SAILOR, but I'm not on a boat\nnow.\cIt makes me wonder--what should\na SAILOR on land be called?\cThat's what I've been thinking\nwhile staring out across the waves.\cAll right, next time!
It's [STR_VAR_1].\nSo? Get any more POKéMON?\cIf you catch a new POKéMON,\nyou have to come show me.\cI won't whine for it, honest.\nI'll be waiting. See you.
This is [STR_VAR_1].\cAre you raising your POKéMON\nin the optimal way?\cThe air is clean where I am.\nIt's the perfect environment for\rraising POKéMON.\cIf you're going to focus on raising\nPOKéMON, you should come out to\r[STR_VAR_2]. Take care now.
Hi, this is [STR_VAR_1].\cI gave a [POKEBLOCK] to my [STR_VAR_2].\nIt seemed to enjoy it very much.\cIt looks like POKéMON have their\nlikes and dislikes with [POKEBLOCK]S.\cI find that quite fascinating.\nPlease do take care.
[STR_VAR_1] here.\cIf you cooperate with POKéMON,\none can be comfortable in the wild.\cEveryone should realize that and\ncooperate with POKéMON more.\cThat would be ideal.\nI really think so.\cI think you're on the right track!\nCatch you later!
Hi, it's [STR_VAR_1]. You know,\nthe TRAINER who's always prepared!\c[PLAYER][KUN], do you have enough items?\nAre your POKéMON fit for action?\cKeeping everything perfect around\nyou all the time is the secret to\rkeeping your journey going.\cI'd better go check my own\nsupplies! Be vigilant!
It's [STR_VAR_1]!\nIt's [STR_VAR_1]!\c[STR_VAR_2] is a very busy\nthoroughfare, so I get challenged\rby all kinds of TRAINERS every day.\cToday, I won five battles and lost\nonly three!\cHow did you do today?\nTell me about it next time, okay?
It's me, [STR_VAR_1].\cI'm popular because I have lots\nof BUG POKéMON, right?\cWell, I took a bunch of my fave\nbugs to school today.\cThis girl I like started crying!\nGo ahead and laugh if you want.\cI have to try teaching her what\nmakes BUG POKéMON so appealing.\cSnivel…\nSee you!
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!\cHi! It's [STR_VAR_1]! Hah! Hah!\cTrying to chat…\nWhile climbing…\rIs harsh exercise… Hah! Hah!\cUrgh! Oof…\nIt's steeper now…\rWe'll chat…another time…\rHah! Hah! Hah!
Oh, hi!\cI'm still searching for treasures\nwith KIRA!\cMaybe there isn't any treasure\nhere at all…\cBut the important thing is for me\nto search alongside KIRA.\cOh, hey, KIRA!\nWh-why are you angry?\cI'm not ignoring you, honey!\nYou're my one and only!\c…[PLAYER], I have to go, bye!
This is [STR_VAR_1]!\cI went to DEWFORD's GYM again\nfor training.\cBRAWLY, the GYM LEADER, seems\nto be tougher now.\cSomething about being toughened\nby the wild waves…\cBut he's still as cool as ever.\nThe ladies adore him!\rIt makes me envious, frankly.\cI wonder… Is his friend BRUNO\nthe same way as BRAWLY?\cYou know, all sweaty or smelly,\nand prone to calling people\r“big wave,” that sort of thing.\cBut, hey, this jealousy thing isn't\nvery seemly, is it?\cForget this chat ever happened,\nhow about it? So long!
It's a pleasure to chat with\na young TRAINER like you.\cI imagine that you will continue to\nenjoy POKéMON whatever your age.\cWouldn't it be good if you had\na partnership like ours?\cOf course, [PLAYER][KUN], you already\nenjoy the trust and companionship\rof your POKéMON now.\cYou have the makings of long and\nenduring relationships already!\cHahaha!\nNever be discouraged!
Hi, this is [STR_VAR_1]!\nWe just won a battle!\cWe don't win often, but it was this\ncool SWIMMER guy.\cMy sister was steamed!\cShe wanted to pretend that she\nwas weak to make an impression!\cShe always chews me out whether\nwe win or lose!\c[PLAYER][KUN], can you say something\nto her next time?\cOkay, see you!
[STR_VAR_1] here, yes.\nI headed out to sea yesterday.\cI had been hoping to find a new\nruin to explore.\cBut the tides somehow seemed to\ncarry me back where I started.\cI'm still weak at battling, too…\nFeel free to mock me…\rBut I won't give up.\cMy day will come when I discover\na new ruin!\cThat's all I have to say!\nFarewell for now!
Ahoy there!\nIt's me, [STR_VAR_1]!\rI'm out on ROUTE 108 now!\rIn other words, where I always am!\cToday, a gorgeous SWIMMER \nswam by me!\cSo I startled her with a shout!\cAnd she gave me a nasty glare!\cThat's all from ROUTE 108!\nBrought to you by [STR_VAR_1]!
It's [STR_VAR_1]!\cI'm kind of busy, but I figured\nI should let you know that I've\rbeaten five TRAINERS again today.\cIf I keep this pace up, I can\nprobably beat you next time.\cI think we'll be good rivals,\nyou and I. Good-bye for now!

JUAN: Hmm…\n[PLAYER][KUN]… Was it?\cOur battle together--it brought\nto me memories of when I first\rencountered WALLACE.\cPerhaps you are a genius who may\nyet surpass WALLACE!
JUAN: Fufu… [PLAYER][KUN]…\nYou've finally achieved your goal.\cMy eye for appraising talent wasn't\nmistaken…\cI wish for another chance to meet\nyou, for you have scaled the peak\rof power and prestige.

SIDNEY: Yo, [PLAYER]!\cIf you want to battle with me\nagain, you come on back whenever\ryou like to the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cI'll always be here!\nI'll be waiting!
PHOEBE: Hi, [PLAYER]!\cHow about coming back here again\nsometime?\cI'd like to see how much tighter\nyour bond has grown with your\rPOKéMON.
GLACIA: Hello, [PLAYER].\cI trust you haven't become\ncomplacent with your power?\cIf you feel the need to cool your\nhot emotions just a little, do come\rto the POKéMON LEAGUE…
DRAKE: That voice… [PLAYER], is it?\nYou sound well…\cI understand that there is now\na facility called the BATTLE\rFRONTIER that tests the skills of\rTRAINERS.\cHowever, if you wish to have real\nbattles, there is no substitute for\rthe POKéMON LEAGUE!\cDon't you agree, [PLAYER]?
WALLACE: Hello, [PLAYER][KUN].\nHave you met STEVEN?\cHe is…\nActually incredibly skilled.\cHowever, he's an odd soul who\nrarely battles.\cInstead, he would rather look for\nrare stones.\cI'm sure he's digging in a cave or\na craggy mountain somewhere.\cBut what is a rare stone exactly?\nAll I can think of is a METEORITE…
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\cMAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI was just in PACIFIDLOG a little\nwhile ago.\cI saw a giant green POKéMON\nflying high in the sky.\cI…\nI've never seen anything like it.\cI wonder what it was.\nIs this maybe a major discovery?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\cBRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER]!\nI was in PACIFIDLOG just now.\cI saw this huge green POKéMON\nflying across the sky.\cI've never seen anything that\namazing before.\cI wish you could've seen it,\n[PLAYER].\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cMR. BRINEY retired as a SAILOR,\nbut I still see him out on the sea\rwith his pet PEEKO sometimes.\cHe must love the sea still.
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou know how little towns like\nPETALBURG and DEWFORD have GYMS?\cFor some reason, the big port of\nSLATEPORT doesn't have a GYM.\cWhen they finally build a GYM there,\nI should apply to be the LEADER.
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cDo you remember a man named\nthe CUTTER in RUSTBORO?\rHe had a house there, remember?\cWell, I found out his younger\nbrother lives in MAUVILLE.\cCan you guess his name?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cThe ROCK SMASH GUY!
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]?\cRUSTURF TUNNEL…\nThey named it that because it\rjoins RUSTBORO and VERDANTURF.
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], how are you?\cI'm out on ROUTE 111 now.\cI'm going to get a rest at an old\nlady's house.\cShe lives just north of\nthe desert.
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cDid you know about the MIRAGE\nTOWER in the desert?\cThey say, like a mirage, it seems\nto mysteriously come and go.\cI wish I could see it.
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], yahoo!\nI'm on ROUTE 119 now.\cThere's a big river here, and\nit often rains.\cI got soaked!
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN], hi.\cMT. PYRE is a memorial to POKéMON\nwhose lives have ended.\cMaybe as a result, it's infested\nwith many GHOST-type POKéMON!
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI was thinking of going to the hot\nspring in LAVARIDGE.\cBut on the way, around JAGGED\nPASS, I ran into some bad-looking\rcharacters. The mood was ugly!
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nDid you see the news?\cThey say CAPT. STERN discovered\nthe SEAFLOOR CAVERN while on his\rsubmarine expedition.
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nDon't you think it's neat?\cEven if you don't have a boat,\nyou can cross the sea using\ra POKéMON's move.\cDid you know there's more?\cThere's a POKéMON move that lets\nyou go to the bottom of the sea.
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nHope things are okay!\cHave you been on the sea and\nfound your way to the other side\rblocked?\cTry diving deep underwater and\nfollowing trenches.\cWhen you get to the other side,\ncome up to the surface. Easy!
MAY: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHow's it going?\nAre you filling your POKéDEX?\cI heard a rumor that there are\nsuper-ancient POKéMON out there.\rAnd there are three of them!\cI would love to see even one…
MAY: [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI heard the rumors!\cYou beat the SOOTOPOLIS GYM\nLEADER?\cThat means you don't have far\nto go, do you?
MAY: There isn't a single TRAINER\nleft in HOENN who doesn't know who\ryou are, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWhen I tell people that I'm friends\nwith you, [PLAYER][KUN], they're all\rsurprised!
BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER]!\cMR. BRINEY retired as a SAILOR,\nbut I still see him out on the sea\rwith his pet PEEKO sometimes.\cI guess he must love\nthe sea still.
BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER]!\cI don't get how little towns like\nPETALBURG and DEWFORD have GYMS.\cI mean, not when the big port of\nSLATEPORT doesn't have a GYM.\cWhen they finally build a GYM there,\nI should apply to be the LEADER.
BRENDAN: Yo, [PLAYER]!\cDo you remember a guy named\nthe CUTTER in RUSTBORO?\rHe had a house there, right?\cWell, it turns out his little\nbrother lives in MAUVILLE.\cCan you guess his name?\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cThe ROCK SMASH GUY!
BRENDAN: This voice… [PLAYER]?\cThey gave RUSTURF TUNNEL its name\nbecause it joins RUSTBORO and\rVERDANTURF.\cDid you know that?
BRENDAN: [PLAYER], what's up?\cHey, I'm out on ROUTE 111 now.\cI'm going to rest up at an old\nlady's house north of the desert.\cIf you're in the area, you should\nvisit her, too.
BRENDAN: Hey, [PLAYER]!\cDid you know about the MIRAGE\nTOWER in the desert?\cThey say, like a mirage, it can be\nseen only sometimes.\cI'd like to see that!
BRENDAN: Who's this? Oh, [PLAYER]?\nGuess what? I'm on ROUTE 119 now.\cThere's a big river here, and\nit rains all the time.\cI got soaked to the bone!
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]!\cMT. PYRE is a memorial to POKéMON\nwhose lives have ended.\cThat's probably why it's infested\nwith many GHOST-type POKéMON!
BRENDAN: Hey there, [PLAYER].\cI was on my way back to the hot\nspring in LAVARIDGE.\cBut around JAGGED PASS, I ran into\nsome nasty-looking characters.\cThose creeps…\nI think they were TEAM MAGMA.
BRENDAN: Hi, [PLAYER]!\nDid you catch the news?\cThey say CAPT. STERN discovered\nthe SEAFLOOR CAVERN while on his\rsubmarine expedition.
BRENDAN: Hey there, [PLAYER]!\nDon't you think it's awesome?\cEven if you don't have a boat,\nyou can cross the sea using\ra POKéMON's move.\cAnd, there's a move that lets you\ntravel to the bottom of the sea.\cMan, POKéMON can do anything!
BRENDAN: Howdy, [PLAYER]!\nHow are you holding up?\cEver found your way to the other\nside blocked while on the sea?\cTry diving deep underwater and\nfollowing trenches at the bottom.\cWhen you get to the other side,\ncome up to the surface. Simple!
BRENDAN: Hey there, [PLAYER]!\cHow's it going? Filling up your\nPOKéDEX successfully?\cI heard a rumor that there are\nsuper-ancient POKéMON out there.\rAnd not just one--three!\cI'd love to catch even one…
BRENDAN: [PLAYER]!\nI heard the rumors!\cYou beat the SOOTOPOLIS GYM\nLEADER? Awesome!\cYou're getting awful close now!
BRENDAN: There isn't a TRAINER in\nall of HOENN who doesn't know who\ryou are, [PLAYER]!\cWhen I tell people that I'm friends\nwith you, [PLAYER], they get pretty\renvious!
WALLY: Oh, [PLAYER]!\cI've been getting healthier and\nmore physically fit.\cI hope I can become a TRAINER like\nyou soon, [PLAYER]!
WALLY: [PLAYER], hello!\cAfter RUSTURF TUNNEL went\nthrough, WANDA's been very happy!
WALLY: Oh, [PLAYER]!\cI… I left my uncle's place in\nVERDANTURF without telling anyone.\cI wonder if he's furious with me…\c[PLAYER], you understand how\nI feel, don't you?
WALLY: [PLAYER]?\nIt's me, WALLY!\cThe world of TRAINERS is amazing!\cWhen I have my POKéMON with me,\nall sorts of people say hi!\cIt's as if everyone's getting\nconnected through POKéMON!
WALLY: [PLAYER]? It's awesome!\nThat RALTS we caught together?\rIt evolved, [PLAYER]!\cMaybe I'm talented…\cOh, but I shouldn't get a big head\nlike that!\cAfter all, it's the POKéMON that\nshould be praised!
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cWALLY appears to be out of\nthe POKéNAV's service area…
WALLY: Oh, [PLAYER]!\cBefore I met you, I hardly ever\nleft my house…\cBut now, I'm on an adventure with\nmy very own POKéMON…\c[PLAYER]…\nThank you…
SCOTT: Howdy, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou know how POKéMON can be found\neverywhere?\cLike in the mountains, in the sea,\nin tall grass anywhere?\cJust like POKéMON, you can find\nTRAINERS everywhere, too.\cAs a result, I have to hurry\neverywhere, too. Busy, busy!
SCOTT: I'm on ROUTE 119 right now.\nIt's teeming with TRAINERS!\cIt's also overgrown with tall grass\neverywhere, it seems.\cWalking around in shorts here\nmakes me all ticklish!
SCOTT: Hi, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHave you had the chance to climb\nMT. PYRE?\cThe place is a memorial to POKéMON\nthat have passed away.\cIt's somewhere every TRAINER\nshould climb to the top of once.
SCOTT: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI've been hearing about these odd\ngangs being a nuisance.\cTEAM MAGMA and TEAM AQUA,\nI think they were.\cI would think there'd be some\nskilled TRAINERS among them.\c…But if they're thugs…
SCOTT: Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN].\cMight there be tough TRAINERS\nat the bottom of the sea?\cI can't go check for myself.\nI can't swim, for one.\rAnd I don't raise POKéMON…
SCOTT: Hi, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou know that you can challenge\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE when you've\rcollected all the GYM BADGES?\cWith your talent, becoming the\nCHAMPION isn't a pipe dream.\cBut did you know?\nThere's somewhere even better.\cBut, that's all I'm willing to say\nfor the time being.\cIt's something you can look\nforward to.\cWhen you've won your way through\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE into the HALL\rOF FAME!
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cSCOTT appears to be out of\nthe POKéNAV's service area…
DAD: In RUSTBORO, there's a man\nthat goes by the odd name of\rthe CUTTER.\cIf you're in the area, you should\npay him a visit.
DAD: Hm… Little by little, but also\nvery surely, you're getting\rtougher, [PLAYER].\cThe stronger you get, the farther\nand higher you soar from Mother\rand me…\cThis feeling is hard to explain.
DAD: I see…\nYou've collected four GYM BADGES…\cThere's no avoiding it now.\nWe will battle like I promised.\cCome anytime.\nWe'll all be waiting for you!
DAD: [PLAYER]! You'd better go visit\nMother every so often.\cI'm going to remain here and\nredouble my training.\cThe way of battling is deep\nand unforgiving!
DAD: Oh, hi, [PLAYER]!\cWhat's that? MAGMA EMBLEM?\nI don't know what that's about.\cBut with a name like that, it may\nbe somehow linked to a volcano!
DAD: Hiyah! Haah! Dwah!\c…Oh? [PLAYER]!\cYou caught me right in the middle\nof a POKéMON training session!
DAD: [PLAYER]!\cWho would've thought you'd become\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION…\cOkay!\nI won't be left behind!
DAD: Hm? [PLAYER]?\nWhat good timing!\cThis time, I'm going to challenge\nyou to battle.\cI'm waiting in the PETALBURG GYM.\nAccept my challenge anytime!
DAD: …You amaze me, [PLAYER].\nHow much higher will you soar?
STEVEN: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHave you been to MAUVILLE\nalready?\cYou should visit the BIKE SHOP\nand get a MACH BIKE.\cThen, try exploring the GRANITE\nCAVE thoroughly.\cYou may make a new discovery\nthere.
STEVEN: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI've met a lot of different\nTRAINERS so far.\cBut you're one of a kind.\nYou're not like anyone else.
STEVEN: Hi, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWhen you're on an adventure with\nyour POKéMON, what do you think?\cDo you consider them to be strong\npartners?\cDo you think of them as fun\ncompanions?\cDepending on how you think, your\nadventure's significance changes.
STEVEN: Hello?\n[PLAYER][KUN]?\cI'm involved in a spot of trouble\nat the SPACE CENTER.\cI'm sorry, but I can't talk now.\nBye!
STEVEN: Oh!\n[PLAYER][KUN]!\cThere's no need to talk.\nIt's past time for talking.\cYou have to believe in yourself\nand do what's right.
… … … … … …\cSTEVEN appears not to be getting\nthe call…
STEVEN: [PLAYER][KUN]… Congratulations\nfor entering the HALL OF FAME.\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\cI hope we can meet again\nsomewhere!
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI've already heard about you!\cIt seems your POKéNAV's been\nupgraded with MATCH CALL.\cWell, I should register, too!\cThat way, I'd be able to examine\nyour POKéDEX even while you're\rout in the field.\c… … … … … …
Registered PROF. BIRCH\nin the POKéNAV.
PROF. BIRCH: When one has both\nthe POKéDEX and POKéNAV, studying\rPOKéMON becomes more fun, eh?
MR. STONE: Oh? [PLAYER][KUN]!\cSince you called me, the POKéNAV\nmust be working properly!\cOther people will be registered,\nso try calling them up, too!\cGood! Good!\nYou seem to be quite happy!\cHm…\nHow could I know that?\cIt's because I'm looking down at\nyou from my office window!\cWahahaha!\nSee you again!
MR. STONE: Oh? [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWhat's wrong? Have you forgotten\nabout that little errand of mine?\cI need you to deliver my letter\nto STEVEN in DEWFORD.\cAfter that, deliver our parcel to\nCAPT. STERN in SLATEPORT.\cYou remember, don't you?\cNow, since I am a busy PRESIDENT,\nI have to go! Bye-bye!
MR. STONE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\cAh, so you've met STEVEN!\nI'd better reward you, then!\cWhen you visit RUSTBORO again,\ncome see me at my office.\cI'll be waiting for you!
MR. STONE: Oh! [PLAYER][KUN]!\cDid you know that DEVON was\ndigging the RUSTURF TUNNEL?\cBut we shut down the operation to\nprotect the POKéMON in the area.\cIt's a no-brainer, really.\cIt's more important to let POKéMON\nlive in peace than worry about our\rown convenience.
MR. STONE: Hello, hello, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI heard from someone in PETALBURG\nthat you're NORMAN's child!\cNo wonder you're such a capable\nbeing!
MR. STONE: What's that?\cYou battled your own father and\ndefeated him?\cThat's astounding!\cI had no idea that I befriended\nsomeone so special! Wahaha!
Hello!\nThis is DEVON CORPORATI…\rOh, hello, [PLAYER]!\cOur PRESIDENT was here a little\nwhile ago, but he's gone out.\cOur PRESIDENT is busy, but you\nseem to be just as busy, [PLAYER].
…Huh? …What's that?\cGROU… Yes? …DON?\cYou're breaking up…\n…can't hear…\cBZZZZ…
…Huh? …What's that?\cSeaflo… Yes? …Caver…?\cYou're breaking up…\n…can't hear…\cBZZZZ…
MR. STONE: [PLAYER][KUN]! It's me!\cYou were apparently involved in all\nsorts of things, but I, being busy,\rhaven't a clue exactly what!\cHowever, I urge you to take\nthe road you believe in and walk it.\cI'll always be in your corner!\nTake care!
MR. STONE: … … … … … …\nIs this maybe [PLAYER][KUN]?\cYour voice is so full of confidence,\nI didn't recognize you right off!\cHm! You must come visit us at DEVON\nsometime!
Um, I'm [STR_VAR_1]'s no. [STR_VAR_2] apprentice.\nSnivel… This tension is getting to me…

This is nerve-racking…\nI'm the no. [STR_VAR_2] apprentice of [STR_VAR_1].
I am [STR_VAR_1]'s no. [STR_VAR_2] apprentice,\nand that's no lie.
Are you… [PLAYER]?\nOh! Sniff…sob…\cOh! S-sorry…\nI'm so nervous, I can't help crying…\cI'm [STR_VAR_1], and I really look up\nto you, [PLAYER].\cI… I had this dream of one day meeting\nyou and asking you about POKéMON.\cPlease, please, [PLAYER]!\nPlease teach me about POKéMON!
Oh… B-but…\nSnivel… Waaaaaaah!\cPlease!\nI'm begging you, please!
Oh, really? You will?\nAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\cOh… I'm sorry…\nI'm so happy, I'm crying…\cUm… Then please tell me!\nIt's about the BATTLE TOWER.\cWhich would be better for me: Level 50\nor the Open Level?
[STR_VAR_1]?\nWaaaaah!\cOh! I'm so sorry!\nYou've made me happy by choosing\rthe level for me, and it's made me cry…\cSnivel…\nThank you so much!\rPlease talk with me again!
Wowee! You're [PLAYER], aren't you?\nYou're awesomely strong, aren't you?\cI'm [STR_VAR_1]!\nI just became a TRAINER!\cPlease, [PLAYER]!\nCan you be my teacher and tell me\rlots about being a TRAINER?
Aww, why?\nOh, please? Pretty please?\rPlease be my teacher, please!
Yay! Great!\cThe first thing I wanted to ask you is\nabout the BATTLE TOWER!\cThe Level 50 and Open Level Rooms…\nWhich would be perfect for me?
[STR_VAR_1], huh? That's true!\nI'll do my best there!\cIf we meet here again, please teach\nme something else, teacher!
Um… Are you [PLAYER]?\nMy name is [STR_VAR_1].\cI want to become a POKéMON TRAINER,\nbut I don't know what to do…\cSo I thought maybe I could ask you for\nadvice because you're so famous.\c[PLAYER], could you give me advice?
Oh, but…\cI sincerely want to become a POKéMON\nTRAINER!\cPlease, can you answer my questions?
Thank you!\nHere's my first question right away!\cThe BATTLE TOWER has two levels,\nLevel 50 and Open Level, right?\cWhich level do you think is more\nsuitable for me?
Oh, the [STR_VAR_1] challenge?\nUnderstood!\cIf I have another question, I'll come\nback here for your advice!
Oh? Huh? You're…\nNo, that can't be true.\cThere isn't any way that someone\nlike me could meet [PLAYER].\c…You really are [PLAYER]?\nI can't believe I'm talking to you!\cWhen something this good happens,\nonly terrible things will happen to me\rnow, I just know it…\c…I'm sorry…\nI'm… [STR_VAR_1]…\cThere isn't anything special about\nme that I can be proud of…\cI shouldn't even say anything about\nmyself because you'll forget…\cI had this dream that if I ever met\nyou, [PLAYER], that maybe I could ask\ryou for advice as a TRAINER.\cBut I don't think you would agree\nto that.\c…Or will you be so kind as to give\nme advice?
I knew it…\cIt had to happen because I'm such\na really boring nobody…\cBut I thought just maybe…\nYou won't reconsider, will you?\cBut I can't give up just like that.\nI'll ask you while I'm still lucky!\cPlease, will you be so kind as to give\nme advice?
Really? I can't believe it!\nI can't believe you'll advise me!\rI… I'm so happy…\cWhat I want to ask you is really\ntrivial, but I can't decide…\cAt the BATTLE TOWER, they let you\nchoose Level 50 or Open Level.\cWhich course do you think even I may\nhave a chance at?
[STR_VAR_1]? Okay!\nBut do you really think someone like\rme would have a chance?\cI'll do my best, even though I don't\nthink it will work.\cThank you very much for spending\ntime with someone like me.
Oh! You're [PLAYER][KUN], aren't you?\cI've heard that you're tough at\nPOKéMON!\cI'm [STR_VAR_1]!\nI'll be your friend!\cDid you know?\cYou can't win at the BATTLE FRONTIER\nif all you know is what they teach at\rthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\cI'm willing to listen to your advice.\nYou'll agree, of course?
Huh? Why are you refusing me?\nIt's me who's asking you!\rYou have to reconsider!
Okay, so there is this something.\nI want you to decide it for me.\cYou know that the BATTLE TOWER has\nLevel 50 and Open Level Rooms?\cWhich do you think would be good\nfor me, [PLAYER][KUN]?
Okay, [STR_VAR_1] is suitable for me?\nThank you!\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
Oh, hi, there! [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI know you because you're famous!\rCall me [STR_VAR_1]! Glad to meet you!\cI'm a TRIATHLETE, so I keep myself\nfit even while I raise POKéMON.\cI'm also involved with other things\nlike work, napping, ballroom dancing…\cBeing this busy, it's not so easy for\nme to become a decent TRAINER.\cSo, I have a proposition!\cThere must be a reason why we met.\nSo, [PLAYER][KUN], how about sharing your\rwisdom with me every so often?
Oh, but, please?\nA guy like me needs someone like\ryou, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHonestly, I need your advice!
Thank you! That's more like it!\nSo, let's start with an easy one!\cYou know about the BATTLE TOWER's\ntwo courses, right?\rYou know, Level 50 and Open Level.\cMe being a busy guy, which one should\nI gear up for?
[STR_VAR_1], huh? Okay, gotcha.\nI'll find time somehow and give it a go!\c…Whoops, I'd better go to work!\nThanks! See you around!
No way! Uh-uh!\nAre you maybe the real [PLAYER]?\cA-hah! Awesome! I'm [STR_VAR_1],\nso pleased to meet you!\c[PLAYER], you're very strong,\naren't you?\cEveryone's talking about you!\cOh! I just had this great idea!\nI'll get advice off you, [PLAYER]!\rI'm sure it will make me tougher!\cIsn't it a great idea?\nPlease, I want your advice!
Ahahaha, you can pretend to be mean,\nbut you can't fool me!\rYou really mean okay, don't you?
Yay! I knew you'd have a big heart,\n[PLAYER]!\cWhat should I ask you first?\n…Oh, I thought of something!\cDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\cIf I were to take a BATTLE TOWER\nchallenge, which way should I go?\cLevel 50 or Open Level?\nWhich suits me more?
Oh-oh-oh!\n[STR_VAR_1], you say!\rThank you for a totally cool reply!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
I beg your pardon, but…\nAre you [PLAYER]?\cI'm [STR_VAR_1], and I am delighted to\nmake your acquaintance.\cI have long been an admirer\nof yours…\c… … … … … …\cUm… I hope you don't find this\nrequest too much of a burden, but…\cMay I become your apprentice,\n[PLAYER]?
Oh…!\c… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\c…I must have fainted from shock.\nI'm sorry, I must have misheard you.\cPlease! Please say that you will\naccept me as your apprentice!
Oh… I'm delighted!\cI don't wish to waste your time,\nso please advise me on this.\cI plan to take a BATTLE TOWER\nchallenge soon.\cHowever, there are two levels…\cWhich would be most suitable for me?\nLevel 50 or Open Level?
[STR_VAR_1] is your choice!\nI see. I will do my best!\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
Eek! Eek! [PLAYER]!\nYou spoke to me!\rI… I'm overjoyed!\cMe! My name is [STR_VAR_1]!\nI just became a TRAINER!\cI'm delighted I met you, [PLAYER],\nthe big name in POKéMON circles!\cOh-oh-oh, I know!\nMay I ask a huge favor, [PLAYER]?\cPlease take me in as your apprentice!\nI want to learn from you!
Waaaah!\n[PLAYER] turned me down…\rIt… It's an invaluable experience!\c[PLAYER], please! I want to hear\nan affirmative answer this time!\cI beg you for your guidance!
Hieeeeh! [PLAYER] said yes!\n[PLAYER] said yes!\cI won't be able to sleep tonight…\nThank you ever so much!\cThen, here's my question!\cAt the BATTLE TOWER, what is right\nfor me, Level 50 or Open Level?
[STR_VAR_1]! Perfectly understood!\nI understand perfectly!\rI'm deliriously delighted!\cI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.
Whoa! Could you be…\nMight you be… [PLAYER][KUN]?!\rThat strong and famous TRAINER?\rWell, hello, aren't I just the luckiest!\cHello, the name's [STR_VAR_1]!\cI've been on the lookout for\na POKéMON teacher.\cAnd with impeccably good timing,\nalong came you, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cSo, there you have it, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nLet me apprentice under you!
Gwaaaah!\nYou're quite cool and tough…\cDon't be that way, please.\nI'm asking you!
Oh, yeah! That's a solid reply!\nExcellent, I might add!\cSo how about a first piece of advice\non the BATTLE TOWER?\cIf I were to go, what would be better?\nLevel 50 or Open Level?
Uh-huh, [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nOK, A-OK!\rI'll go show my mettle, like, jam!\cAll right, I'll look to you as my mentor!\nAdios!
Oh, hey, [PLAYER][KUN], right?\nThe police were looking for you!\c… … …\nOf course I'm lying!\cMe, I'm [STR_VAR_1]. Despite the way\nI look, I'm the POKéMON CHAMPION!\r…That's a lie, too!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at battling.\cSo, how about you becoming my master\nabout all things POKéMON?
If you're going to act cold like that,\nI'll show you what I'll do!\cWaaah! Waaah! Waaah!\nHiccup!\cHahaha, that was my FAKE TEARS!\cCome on, will you please be\nmy POKéMON master?
Yippee!\nI'll buy you a boat for that!\cOf course I'm lying again!\nBut… Thank you, master!\cYou know how there's Level 50 and\nOpen Level at the BATTLE TOWER?\cI'm having trouble deciding which\nlevel I should challenge…\cCan you decide for me, master?
Okay, so [STR_VAR_1] is better!\nI'll go to the other level, then!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy, and it means hi!\cI'm [STR_VAR_1], the rappin' SAILOR\nam I!\cYour turn now, tell me a little about\nyourself, give it a try!\cUh-huh, uh-huh!\n[PLAYER][KUN]'s your name,\rand POKéMON's your game!\cAnd you're at a delicate age\nwhen all the world's your stage!\cAnyway, I just want to say,\nthat you're the tenth TRAINER\rI've spoken to today.\cLet's make that a celebration!\nBecome my mentor for commemoration!
But!\nYou have to work with me!\cDon't be such a tease!\nBecome my mentor, please!
That's it!\n[PLAYER], you've got the spirit!\cSo here's my first question\nthat begs your suggestion!\cIt's about the BATTLE TOWER,\nand it hinges on my power!\cLevel 50 and Open Level there be,\nwhich is the one that's good for me?
Okay, [STR_VAR_1] it is, you say!\nI'll go and take it on my way!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Say, hey, aren't you [PLAYER]?\nWhat should I do? Talk to you?\rWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\c[PLAYER], are you surprised at me?\nI'd better tell you who I happen to be!\c[STR_VAR_1] is what you can call me.\nThe brightest star in guitardom,\rthat's me!\cAre you receiving me?\nYou are receiving me!\cMy luck's at its best,\nI'll hit you with a request!\c[PLAYER], let me be your underling!\nI want you to teach me everything!
You're turning me down, then?\nI'll just have to ask you again!\c[PLAYER], I beg to be your underling!\nI need you to teach me everything!
Lucky, yeah, woohoo!\nShould I pop a question to you?\cSince we're near the BATTLE TOWER,\nhow about a question about its power?\cOf the choices you see,\nwhich is the right one for me?
If [STR_VAR_1] is what you suggest,\nit must be the very best!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
Oh, hi! You there!\nCan I get you to massage my shoulder?\c…Yes, there! That's it!\nOuch, ouch! Oooh, that feels great!\cMy name's [STR_VAR_1].\nI take karate training, but my body's\rnot built to take the abuse…\cI decided I'll battle POKéMON and\ntoughen myself up.\cYou're [PLAYER][KUN], aren't you?\nThe POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMP?\cListen, can I get you to give me\nadvice?
Oh, why?\cI won't be a big bother, I promise!\nPlease?
Thank you. Mighty good of you!\n…Cough! Cough!\cOogh, I have to toughen up quick…\cI'll be heading off to the BATTLE TOWER\nright away, but what would be better\rfor me? Level 50 or Open Level?
Hm, all right. That's [STR_VAR_1].\nI'll go there right away.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up for\nhelp--after all, you're my mentor!
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]…?\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me all self-conscious.\cI… I'm [STR_VAR_1].\cI'm really embarrassed to say this,\nbut I explore ancient ruins and such.\cI'm even more embarrassed to admit\nI'm interested in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\c[PLAYER][KUN], you have a reputation as\na tough TRAINER…\cIt's hard for me to say this,\nbut I want to ask something.\cCould you become my teacher and\ngive me advice?
Please don't brush me off like this!\nI can't live with the humiliation.\cPlease become my teacher!\nI need your advice!
Th-thank you…\cBut please don't look at me like that.\nIt makes me all flustered.\cPlease, answer me without looking\nat my eyes.\cAt the BATTLE TOWER…\nWhich level should I attempt?
Oh… Okay!\nI'll try my hand at that.\cI hope I can make a valiant challenge\nwithout getting all flustered…\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
Hm? You appear to be [PLAYER][KUN]…\nBut are you really real?\cYou may call me [STR_VAR_1].\cI have been toying with the idea of\napprenticing under a strong TRAINER.\cSo, I must say I'm lucky you came along!\n…You really are [PLAYER][KUN], yes?\cNo, no, if you are real, it's fine.\nI merely want you to recognize me\ras your apprentice.
Oh?\nBut what would compel you to refuse?\cI apologize for being skeptical about\nyour identity.\cPlease accept my apology and\naccept me as your apprentice.
You really are accepting me?\nI don't wish to celebrate prematurely.\cIf it is true, I apologize.\nBut now, I need your advice.\cIf I were to enter the BATTLE TOWER,\nwhat would be worthy of me?\rLevel 50 or Open Level?
[STR_VAR_1]?\nAre you certain?\cI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cI realize I can annoy, but it delights\nme that you have accepted me.\cLet us meet again!
Sigh… Sob…\nOh, [PLAYER]!\cI'm all tangled up in a dilemma\nthat I can't decide.\cI can't decide what I should make\nmy [STR_VAR_1] hold.\cPlease tell me, [PLAYER].\nWhat item should I make it hold?
Oh, really? I shouldn't make\nmy [STR_VAR_1] hold anything?
Oh, okay! I'm delighted it's settled!\nAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\cThank you so much!
Oh, I'm so glad…\nI think I have that [STR_VAR_1], too.\cI'm delighted it's settled!\nAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\cThank you so much!
Waaaah! Please don't be mean!\cThat item [STR_VAR_1] was already\nrecommended to me before, sob…\cOr do you mean I shouldn't make\nmy [STR_VAR_2] hold anything?
Yay! It's [PLAYER]!\nGreat! I wanted to ask you something!\cDo you make your POKéMON hold items?\nI want to make mine hold items, but…\cWhat item would be good for\n[STR_VAR_1] to hold?\cWhat do you think?
Huh? You mean my [STR_VAR_1] doesn't\nhave to hold anything?
Oh, I get it! I'll do that!\nThanks for teaching me!
Oh, wow! One [STR_VAR_1], huh?\nOkay, I'll do that!\cThanks for teaching me!
Oh, uh, no, that's not what I meant.\nI want to know about a different item\rthan the ones I already know.\cOr do you mean that my POKéMON doesn't\nhave to hold anything this time?
[PLAYER], hello!\nIt's about my [STR_VAR_1]…\cI want to make it hold a good item.\nWhat would be good for it?
Oh, then my [STR_VAR_1] doesn't have\nto hold anything?
Okay, I got it!\nSee you again!
Oh, the item [STR_VAR_1]?\nUnderstood!\cI'll do my best to find one!\nSee you again!
Somebody taught me about\nthe [STR_VAR_1] already.\cI want my POKéMON to hold a different\nkind of item.\cOr do you think [STR_VAR_2] doesn't\nhave to hold anything?
Hello, [PLAYER]…\nI'm sorry to disturb you, but I have\rsomething else I wanted to ask you.\cI don't think I'm good enough to win\nmatches on my own, so I'm thinking of\rmaking my [STR_VAR_1] hold an item.\cBut I don't know what would be good.\c[PLAYER], please, could you decide\nfor me?
A POKéMON belonging to someone like me\nwould be better off without an item?
I understand…\nYou're saying I shouldn't rely on items.\rI'll do my best not to!\cThank you very much!
The item [STR_VAR_1], okay.\nI'm not sure if I can get one…\rNo! I'll do my best to get it.\cThank you very much!
Oh, but…\nI think I've heard about that before…\cIs it maybe because I haven't handled\nthe item [STR_VAR_1] very well?\cOr do you mean I shouldn't make\nmy [STR_VAR_2] hold anything?
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN].\nThere's something I wanted to ask you.\cYou know how you decided which\nPOKéMON I should have for me?\cBut I never asked you what item\nit should be holding.\cSince you already gave me advice,\nhow about seeing this to the end?\cWhat would be good? I want to make\nmy [STR_VAR_1] hold something.
Oh! So my [STR_VAR_1] should do\nthe best it can empty-handed?
If you think that's best, I'll do that.\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
The item [STR_VAR_1], huh?\nNot bad. I'll use it!\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
Huh? What are you saying?\nYou told me about the [STR_VAR_1]\ralready before.\cOr do you mean my [STR_VAR_2] should\ndo the best it can empty-handed?
Yo, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cWe're both busy, but we seem to run\ninto each other often anyway!\cToday I have to do some walking,\ncleaning, and brushing.\cI haven't even had the time to buy\nmy precious [STR_VAR_1] anything.\cI don't have any time, so how about\ngiving me advice on what I should make\rmy [STR_VAR_1] hold?
Oh, so me being a busy guy, you say\nmy [STR_VAR_1] doesn't need anything?
Okay, gotcha.\nI won't need any time for that.\cThanks today!\nSee you around!
Okay, gotcha.\nI'll find time somehow and find\rthat [STR_VAR_1] you recommended.\cI'm glad I met a good mentor in you.\nThanks! See you around!
Huh? I already know about\nthat [STR_VAR_1].\cOh, right, I get it.\nSo me being a busy guy, you say\rmy [STR_VAR_2] doesn't need anything?
Hiya, [PLAYER]! It's me!\nI need to tap your mind again today.\rPlease, I need your advice!\cDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\cIf I want to make my [STR_VAR_1] hold\nan item, what should it be?
Is that right? My [STR_VAR_1] doesn't\nneed to hold an item, you're saying.
Okay, that's what I'll do!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
Uh-huh! One [STR_VAR_1].\nWhat a cool choice!\rI'll definitely try that!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
Ahahah! That's silly!\nYou already told me about that\r[STR_VAR_1] before!\cAre you feeling okay, [PLAYER]?\cOh, wait! My [STR_VAR_2] doesn't\nneed to hold an item, you're saying.
Hello, [PLAYER]. I hope you've been\nkeeping well.\cMay I approach you for advice?\cIn a recent battle, my opponent\nseemed to have given his POKéMON\ran item to hold.\cAs a result, I was defeated…\cI don't wish to be left behind.\nI would like to make my [STR_VAR_1]\rhold an item, too.\cIt would please me if you could decide\nwhat would be right for my POKéMON…
In other words… My POKéMON has\nno need to hold an item?
I understand clearly now!\nI will keep trying like this.\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
One [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nI will order it right away.\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
You've already told me about that,\nand I already have it.\cOr are you saying… My POKéMON has\nno need to hold an item?
Eek! [PLAYER]!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you again!\cOh-oh-oh! There's something I just\nhad to ask you, [PLAYER]!\cPlease decide what my [STR_VAR_1]\nshould be holding!
Oh, wow! I didn't expect that answer!\nSo, a hold item isn't necessary?
Perfectly understood!\nI'll keep at this without an item!\cI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.
[STR_VAR_1]! I'll use that!\cUm… Could it be, [PLAYER], you also\nmake your POKéMON hold that item?\cI'll be sure to get it!\nI hope you'll be willing to teach me\rsome more another time.
Oh? You recommended that\n[STR_VAR_1] before, too.\cOr is it the best thing to hold?\nOr do you mean that my [STR_VAR_2]\rdoesn't need anything to hold?
Hola!\nMy maestro, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cI want to hit you up for advice on\nPOKéMON tools.\cWhat do you think would be good for\nmy [STR_VAR_1] to hold?\cDon't be shy now.\nLet's blurt it out!
Oh? So, you're saying my [STR_VAR_1]\ncan win without holding any item?
Si, bueno!\nI'll give it my best shot, like, slam!\cAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!
Uh-huh, that's one [STR_VAR_1]?\nSi, bueno!\rI'll go find me one, like, bam!\cAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!
No, no! You already told me about\nthat [STR_VAR_1] thing before.\cOh, now wait just one minute here…\nSo, you're saying my [STR_VAR_2]\rcan win without holding any item?
[PLAYER][KUN], something unbelievable\nhas happened!\cI woke up this morning, and my POKéMON\nhad 10 NUGGETS!\cOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at thinking about\rwhat items POKéMON should hold.\cSo, how about deciding for me what\nmy [STR_VAR_1] should hold, master?
What's that mean?\nDon't make it hold anything?
Okay, so it shouldn't hold anything.\nThen, I'd better get something for it!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
Okay, so it's one [STR_VAR_1]!\nI'll make it hold anything but that!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
Um, you told me about that before,\ndidn't you?\cIsn't there something else?\cOr do you mean, don't make\nmy [STR_VAR_2] hold anything?
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\cThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI present to you a question\rthat's pretty fly!\cIt's an item question\nthat begs your suggestion!\cMy [STR_VAR_1] needs an item to hold,\nWhat should it be, if I may be bold?
Is that right?\nMy [STR_VAR_1] doesn't need to be\rholding anything tight?
Okay, I hear you, sure I do!\nMy POKéMON will go empty-handed, too!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Okay, one [STR_VAR_1],\nthat's what I'll use.\rI was right to make you choose!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Okay, one [STR_VAR_1], you say?\nYou told me that the other day.\rI need a new idea, a brand new way.\cOr, what, is that right?\nMy POKéMON doesn't need to hold\ranything tight?
Say, hey, [PLAYER]!\nI found you again today!\cWhat should I do? Get your advice?\nWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\c[PLAYER], are you getting sick of me?\nNah, no way, that can't be.\cWill you hear me out?\nI'm looking for advice--that's what\rI'm talking about.\cIt's about a hold item for\nmy [STR_VAR_1] that'd be good.\rMy indecision is making me brood.
My [STR_VAR_1] needs nothing?\nDoesn't need to hold anything?
If holding nothing is the best,\nI'll do as you suggest!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
If holding that [STR_VAR_1] is\nthe best, I'll do as you suggest!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
Haven't I heard about that\n[STR_VAR_1] before?\rI'm certain I have, that's for sure!\cI need a new something!\nOr, my [STR_VAR_2] needs nothing?\rDoesn't need to hold anything?
Gwah! Ouch! [PLAYER][KUN], my arm's broken!\nDon't touch it, please!\cI must've broken it while I was trying\nout different hold items with my posse\rof POKéMON.\cSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\c[PLAYER][KUN], what do you think would be\ngood for my [STR_VAR_1] to hold?
Ouch…\cSo your suggestion is my [STR_VAR_1]\ndoesn't have to hold anything?
Hm, all right. That would be easier\nfor me, the way things are now.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.
Hm, all right. That's one [STR_VAR_1].\nMy POKéMON's arm is fine, so I'll make\rit hold that item right away.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.
No, no, you told me about that\n[STR_VAR_1] before, remember?\cHow about telling me something\neven better?\cOh, wait a second.\nSo your suggestion is my [STR_VAR_2]\rdoesn't have to hold anything?
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]…\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nMy POKéMON don't have anything.\cI… I'm really embarrassed about this,\nbut I really need your advice.\cI can't decide what hold item would\nmake my [STR_VAR_1] strong.\c[PLAYER][KUN], what do you think would\nbe good?
Oh… Then, you think it would be better\nif my [STR_VAR_1] didn't have an item?
Oh… Okay!\nI'll go without an item.\cThis is nerve-racking, though.\nWouldn't it be too cool?\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
Oh… Okay!\nI'll go with that [STR_VAR_1].\cThis is nerve-racking, though.\nWouldn't it be too cool?\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
B-but I already heard about that.\cPlease don't brush me off like this!\nI can't live with the humiliation.\cOh… Am I jumping to conclusions?\nDo you think it would be better if\rmy [STR_VAR_2] didn't have an item?
Hm? You appear to be [PLAYER][KUN]…\nBut are you really?\rPerhaps you're a twin?\cOh, no, no, no, don't worry!\nIf you really are [PLAYER], please\rforget about my rudeness.\cWhat I would like is some more of\nyour fine advice.\cI have here my [STR_VAR_1] that I wish\nto make hold a convenient item.\cWhat would be worthy of it?
It's better if it held nothing?\nAre you certain?
I see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cLet us meet again!
One [STR_VAR_1]?\nAre you certain?\cI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cI do hope my POKéMON will be able to\nput it to good use.\cLet us meet again!
No, no, wait a minute.\nI believe you taught me that before.\cI would like you to recommend\nsomething different this time.\cPerhaps you're suggesting that\nmy [STR_VAR_2] should hold nothing?\rAre you certain?
Waah, [PLAYER]!\nI have a dilemma, sob…\cI want to begin battling other people,\nbut I don't know what to do.\cHow should I line up my POKéMON\nso they'll be at their strongest?\cPlease tell me, [PLAYER].\nIf you were me, which of these POKéMON\rwould you send out first?
My [STR_VAR_1] should go first?\nWaaaaah!\cOh! I'm so sorry!\nYou've made me happy by choosing\rmy first POKéMON, and it's made me cry…\cThank you so much!
Yay! It's [PLAYER]!\nGreat! I wanted to ask you something!\cUm, of my POKéMON, which do you\nthink should go out first?
My [STR_VAR_1]? That's true.\nOkay, I'll do that!\cThanks for teaching me!
[PLAYER], hello!\cI think, in a battle, it's very important\nwhich POKéMON comes out first.\cOut of the POKéMON that I have,\nwhich would be good to send out first?
My [STR_VAR_1] goes first?\nOkay, I got it!\cSee you again!
Hello, [PLAYER]…\nI'm sorry to disturb you again with\ranother question.\cI have so little confidence, I don't\nknow what I'd do without you, [PLAYER].\cIt may be a waste of time for me to\neven worry about it, but I just can't\rdecide something…\cWhich of my POKéMON should I send\nout first in a battle?
My [STR_VAR_1]?\nUnderstood!\cI can't believe that you would bother\nto answer my questions so often!\cI'm so grateful that you would even\nspeak with me… Thank you!
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]! It's me!\nI'm so glad to see you because I have\rthis little problem.\cI can't decide how my POKéMON should\nbe lined up. Could you decide for me?\cOh, you don't need to decide the whole\nparty right now.\cHow about deciding just the first\nPOKéMON for me?
My [STR_VAR_1]? That's great!\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
Hi, my teacher [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI'm busy again today!\cI have to do some cycling, shopping,\nand humming.\cI haven't even had the time to decide\nhow to line up my POKéMON team.\cSo, how about checking out my team?\nWhich one should go first?
Okay, gotcha.\nI have enough time at least to put\rmy [STR_VAR_1] at the head of the line!\cWhoops, my girlfriend's waiting!\nThanks! See you around!
Yoohoo! Hiya, [PLAYER]!\nYou always walk around looking tough!\cListen, I need something from you\nagain! It's the usual thing!\cDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is about my team.\cWhich POKéMON of mine should be first\nto go out in a battle?
Hmhm!\nMy [STR_VAR_1], you say!\rThanks for a most cool answer!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
Thank you so much for stopping to\nchat with me, [PLAYER].\cI know I'm taking advantage of your\nkindness, but may I ask for advice?\cI would like you to decide on the order\nof my POKéMON team.\cIt would please me if you could decide\nwhich POKéMON should come first.
My [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nI will put it first right away!\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
Eek! [PLAYER]!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you again!\cMy POKéMON have become much\nstronger!\cBut I don't always win. It seems to\ndepend on which POKéMON goes first.\c[PLAYER], please, I need your help!\cPlease decide which of my POKéMON\nshould go out first!
Sigh… I'm overwhelmed with happiness…\cIt's like a dream having you decide\nfor me, [PLAYER].\cBut perfectly understood!\nI will go with my [STR_VAR_1] first!\cI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.
Hello, hello!\nMy mentor, [PLAYER][KUN]!\rHit me with your sage advice today!\cYou see, I pulled together a team of\nthree POKéMON. So far so good.\cBut the team's battling order's not\nsettled yet.\cThis is where you come in, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nYou decide which POKéMON leads off!\cDon't be shy now.\nLet's blurt it out!
Uh-huh, my [STR_VAR_1] leads off!\nOK, A-OK!\rI'll reorder the lineup, like, wham!\cAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!
[PLAYER][KUN], listen!\nIt's a crisis!\cMy POKéMON, all three of them, go into\nbattle at once!\cOf course that's impossible!\nWahahaha!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at thinking about\rhow I should line up my POKéMON.\cSo, how about deciding for me which\nPOKéMON should go first, master?
Okay, so it's my [STR_VAR_1] you chose?\nI'll let any but that one go first!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\cThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI present to you a question\rthat's pretty fly!\cIt's a team lineup question\nthat begs your suggestion!\cOut of this lot, which should go first\nas the first on the spot?
Okay, I hear you, sure I do!\nI'll switch them up, that I'll do!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Yahoo, [PLAYER]!\nHow do you do?\cWhat should I do? Go ahead and ask?\nUh-huh, I have something to ask!\rAre you receiving me?\rYou are receiving me!\cYou have to decide, which of my\nPOKéMON is the first to ride!\rInto battle, I mean to say.
My [STR_VAR_1]? Yes!\nThat'll do, there's no distress!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
…Oof…ooch… [PLAYER][KUN]…\nMy stomach's hurting all of a sudden…\c…It's getting better now…\cI must've worried myself sick racking\nmy brains on how I should line up\rmy posse of POKéMON.\cSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\c[PLAYER][KUN], which of my POKéMON should\ngo first? So I'd win, I mean.
Hm, all right.\nMy [STR_VAR_1] goes first.\cI'll fix the lineup like that after\nI have my supper.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]?\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me feel all flustered.\cUm…\nI really need your advice.\cIt makes me bashful to say this,\nbut I chose my 3-POKéMON team.\rI can't decide on the order, though.\cWhich POKéMON should I send out first\nso I at least look capable?
Oh… Okay!\nI'll lead with my [STR_VAR_1].\cI hope I can do my best without\ngetting all flustered.\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
Hm? You appear to be [PLAYER][KUN]…\nBut are you really?\rPerhaps you're a clever look-alike?\cOh, no, no, no, don't worry!\nIf you really are [PLAYER], please\rforget about my rudeness.\cWhat I would like is your fine advice.\cI have here my POKéMON team.\nI would like you to tell me which one\rshould go first in a battle.
My [STR_VAR_1]…\nYou aren't pulling my leg?\cI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cI am as you see, but I shall do\nmy best.\cLet us meet again!
Snivel…\nOh, [PLAYER]!\cWhat perfect timing!\nThere's something I just can't decide…\cI can't decide which POKéMON I should\nbe using.\cI can't decide between the POKéMON\n[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2]…\c[PLAYER], which do you think will give\neven me a chance at winning?
Snivel… I… I understand!\nOh! I'm so sorry!\rYou've made me so happy, I'm crying…\cI'll do my best to catch one\n[STR_VAR_1]!\cThank you so much!
Yay! It's [PLAYER]!\nYay, you came at the right time, too!\rI need your advice again!\cUm, I'm all mixed up--should I use\nmy [STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2]…\cWhich do you think I should raise,\n[PLAYER]?
Oh, so my [STR_VAR_1] is better!\nOkay, I'll do that!\cThanks for teaching me!
[PLAYER], hello!\nI have a question I wanted to ask.\cI'm in a dilemma over whether I should\nraise one [STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2].\cWhich POKéMON do you think will\nbe stronger?
[STR_VAR_1] is your choice?\nOkay, I got it!\cI'll go catch a strong [STR_VAR_1]\nright away!\cSee you again!
Hello, [PLAYER]…\cUm, you've probably already forgotten\nabout someone like me…\c…But that doesn't matter if you\ncould give me advice…\cI can't decide on the one kind of\nPOKéMON I should raise…\cI've narrowed the field to the POKéMON\n[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2], but that's\rwhere I became stuck…\c[PLAYER], you probably don't want to\nbother, but please decide for me.
But will a wild [STR_VAR_1] even pay\nattention to me?\cI will try!\cBut will I even be able to catch one…\nNo! I'll do my best!\cThank you!
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]! I'm so glad to see you!\nI was about to go looking for you!\cCan you decide what kind of POKéMON\nI should use?\cFor instance…\nHow about the POKéMON [STR_VAR_1]\rand [STR_VAR_2]?\cWhich one do you think would be\nbetter?
[STR_VAR_1]? That's great!\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
If it isn't [PLAYER][KUN]! How's it going?\nI'm busy again as always!\cI want to do good with POKéMON, too,\nbut I haven't been able to decide\rwhich POKéMON I should use.\cYou know how [STR_VAR_1] look strong?\nBut [STR_VAR_2] are tough to ignore.\c[PLAYER][KUN], give me some of your good\nadvice! Which one'd be good for me?
Okay, gotcha.\nI'll find time somehow and catch me\rthat [STR_VAR_1] you recommended.\cI'm glad I met a good mentor in you.\nThanks! See you around!
Oh!\nYay, it's [PLAYER]!\cI didn't waste any time boasting to\nmy friends about meeting you!\cI need to tap your mind again today.\nIt's an easy one for you!\cDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\cIf I were to raise a POKéMON,\nand the choices were one [STR_VAR_1]\ror [STR_VAR_2], which should it be?
Ahhh!\n[STR_VAR_1], you say!\rThanks for a most cool answer!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
Oh, is it you, [PLAYER]?\nI'm delighted to see you again!\cEver since I became your apprentice,\nmy confidence has been blooming.\cI think I'm ready to raise a POKéMON\nof my own!\c[PLAYER], may I impose on you to choose\nwhich POKéMON I should raise?\cThe choices are the POKéMON\n[STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2]…\rWhich POKéMON is right for me?
One [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nI will find one right away!\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
Eek! [PLAYER]! I met you again!\nI… I'm overjoyed!\cOh-oh-oh, I know!\nI shouldn't pass up this opportunity!\cMay I ask a huge favor, [PLAYER]?\nPlease choose a POKéMON for me!\cPlease decide which would be better,\n[STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2]!
Wow! You decided for me!\nOne [STR_VAR_1] is what I'll raise to\rthe best of my ability.\cI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.
Hey, hey!\nMy mentor, [PLAYER][KUN]!\cHello, I've been looking for you\nfor some more of your sage advice!\cWhich kind of POKéMON would be right\nfor me, one [STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2]?\cDon't be shy now.\nLet's blurt it out!
Uh-huh, one [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nOK, A-OK!\rI'll get one in a BALL, like, cram!\cAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!
[PLAYER][KUN], listen! Big news!\nI caught a mirage POKéMON!\cOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at catching\rPOKéMON.\cSo, how about deciding for me which\nkind of POKéMON I should catch,\rmaster?\cWhich would be better?\n[STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2]?
Okay, so it's [STR_VAR_1] you chose?\nI'll grab the other kind, then!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\cThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nSurely you remember who am I?\cToday, I have a POKéMON question\nthat begs your suggestion!\cI have the choice between this\n[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2], you see.\rWhich is the one to catch for me?
[STR_VAR_1], you say, hey, hey!\nI'll go get me one right away!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Oh, wow, if it isn't [PLAYER]!\cWhat should I do? Get your advice?\nWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\cIt's been a long time. Let me break\nthe ice. I'm also looking for advice!\rAre you receiving me?\rYou are receiving me!\cMy POKéMON--which should I use?\nIt's either [STR_VAR_1] or [STR_VAR_2].\rWhich do you choose?
If that [STR_VAR_1] is the best,\nI'll do as you suggest!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
Oh, hi, [PLAYER][KUN]…\nI have this horrible headache…\cI must've worried too much about\nthe kind of POKéMON I should raise.\cSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\c[PLAYER][KUN], if I had to choose between\nthe POKéMON [STR_VAR_1] and\r[STR_VAR_2], which should it be?
Hm, one [STR_VAR_1], all right.\nI'll go look for one when I get better.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]…?\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nI'm getting all flustered…\rI… I need your advice.\cI… I'm really embarrassed, but I can't\ndecide which POKéMON to use.\cIf the choices were [STR_VAR_1] or\n[STR_VAR_2], which would be better?
Oh… Okay!\nI'll do my best with one [STR_VAR_1].\cI hope I can do my best without\ngetting all flustered.\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
Hm? You appear to be [PLAYER][KUN]…\nBut are you really real?\cNo, no, if you are real, it's fine.\nIncidentally, I would like to obtain\ryour advice.\cIt's about the POKéMON I am to use.\cIf the choices are the POKéMON\n[STR_VAR_1] and [STR_VAR_2], which is\rmore worthy of me?
[STR_VAR_1]?\nAre you certain?\cI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cI do hope it is something even I can\nhandle with aplomb.\cLet us meet again!
Waaah! Oh, [PLAYER]!\nSnivel… Hiccup…\cI have a dilemma!\nI can't decide on a move for\rmy [STR_VAR_1]…\cPlease, please, [PLAYER].\nCan you decide for me?\cFor my [STR_VAR_1], which move would\nbe the better choice: [STR_VAR_2]\ror [STR_VAR_3]?
[STR_VAR_1]?\nWaaaaah!\cOh! I'm so sorry, [PLAYER]!\nYou've made me so happy by deciding\rthe move, I'm crying…\cSnivel…\nThank you so much!
Yay! Hi, [PLAYER]!\nI need your advice again!\cI want to teach my [STR_VAR_1]\na cool move.\cI like either of the moves\n[STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3].\rWhat's your recommendation?
[STR_VAR_1] is better? I guess so!\nOkay, I'll go with that!\cIf we meet here again, please teach\nme something else, teacher!
[PLAYER], hello!\nIt's about my [STR_VAR_1], but I'm\rworried about its moves.\cYou see, it's the moves [STR_VAR_2]\nand [STR_VAR_3].\cWhich is stronger and better for\nmy [STR_VAR_1]?
[STR_VAR_1] is your choice?\nOkay, I got it!\cI'll go teach [STR_VAR_1] to\nmy POKéMON right away!\cSee you again!
Ohhh, [PLAYER]…\nI'm hopeless, no, really!\cI've decided to raise a POKéMON,\nbut now I can't even decide what\rmove I should let it learn…\cI know that it doesn't mean anything\nto you, [PLAYER].\cBut it means a lot to me…\cPlease, [PLAYER], could you choose\na move for my [STR_VAR_1]?\cIf you could even choose between\n[STR_VAR_2] and [STR_VAR_3]…
I understand!\cBut will it even be willing to learn\n[STR_VAR_1] for me…\rNo! I'll do my best!\cThank you!
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nI was just hoping to see you, too!\cI was wondering what move would\nbe suitable for my [STR_VAR_1].\cI can't decide, so can you decide\nfor me instead?\cFor instance… How about the moves\n[STR_VAR_2] and [STR_VAR_3]?\rWhich one would be better?
[STR_VAR_1]? That's great!\cKnowing that you made the decision,\n[PLAYER][KUN], I won't be so upset if\rI lose.\cOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!
How could things be this busy?\nHey, if it isn't [PLAYER][KUN]!\rHow's it going?\cSince I got up this morning, I've done\nmy jogging, swimming, and cooking!\cYou wouldn't believe how busy I am!\cI can't even decide what move\nmy [STR_VAR_1] should learn!\c[STR_VAR_2] looks good, huh?\nBut [STR_VAR_3]'s also decent.\c[PLAYER][KUN], give me some of your good\nadvice! Which move'd be good for me?
Okay, gotcha.\nI'll make room in my schedule and\rteach that move.\cI'm glad I met a good mentor in you.\nThanks! See you around!
Oh! Lucky!\nI met you again, [PLAYER]!\rI need to tap your mind again today.\cDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\cFor my [STR_VAR_1], which is the move\nbest suited, [STR_VAR_2] or\r[STR_VAR_3]?
Ahhh!\n[STR_VAR_1], you say!\rThanks for a most cool answer!\cI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\cLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!
Oh, hello, [PLAYER].\nI trust you've been well?\cI have to seek your advice again.\nIt's about my dearest [STR_VAR_1].\cWhat would be the ideal move for\nmy lovable [STR_VAR_1]?\r[STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3]?
[STR_VAR_1] it is!\nI will teach that right away!\cThank you, [PLAYER].\nI hope I can count on you again.\rPlease take care!
Eek! [PLAYER]! I met you again!\nI… I'm overjoyed!\cWhenever I'm in need, you're always\nthere for me, [PLAYER]!\cToday, I want you to recommend\na move for me!\cPlease choose a move for\nmy [STR_VAR_1]!\cWhich move would be better,\n[STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3]?
Oh-oh-oh! Thank you!\n[STR_VAR_1] is it!\rPerfectly understood!\cI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.
Hola, [PLAYER][KUN], bueno!\nI'm hoping for some more of\ryour sage advice today!\cWhat would be the best move for\nmy [STR_VAR_1]?\cIt should be something that'll\nlet me win just like that!\cWould it be [STR_VAR_2]?\nOr [STR_VAR_3]?
Uh-huh, [STR_VAR_1] it is!\nSi, bueno!\rI'll get it taught, like, ka-blam!\cAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!
[PLAYER][KUN], it's completely wild!\cMy POKéMON!\nIt learned six moves!\cOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at choosing moves\rfor my POKéMON.\cSo, how about deciding for me which\nkind of move I should teach?\c[STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3]--which\nwould go with my [STR_VAR_1] best?
Okay, so it's [STR_VAR_1] you chose?\nI'll choose another move, then!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\cThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI'm always with it, don't ask me why.\cToday, I have a move question\nthat begs your suggestion!\c[STR_VAR_2] and [STR_VAR_3] are\nthe moves. What would be the best\rfor my [STR_VAR_1] so it grooves?
[STR_VAR_1], you say, hey, hey!\nI'll go teach that right away!\cIf it's advice I ever need,\n[PLAYER], your word I'll always heed!
Oh, yeahah, if it isn't [PLAYER]!\cWhat should I do? Get your advice?\nWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\c[PLAYER], are you surprised by me?\nI want your advice, can't you see?\cAre you receiving me?\nYou are receiving me!\cMy [STR_VAR_1]--what should it use?\nIt's [STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3],\rwhat do you choose?
If that [STR_VAR_1] is the best,\nI'll do as you suggest!\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\cSee you again, my smart friend!
Gahack! Gaah! Oh, [PLAYER][KUN]…\nI have this lousy cold, I do…\cI want to pick a move for my POKéMON,\nbut I'm not up to it…\cSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\c[PLAYER][KUN], if I had to choose between\n[STR_VAR_2] and [STR_VAR_3] for\rmy [STR_VAR_1], which would it be?
Hm, [STR_VAR_1], all right. Cough!\nI'll go teach it when I get better.\cI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]…?\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nI'm getting all flustered…\rI… I need your advice.\cI… I'm really embarrassed, but I can't\ndecide what move I should teach\rmy POKéMON.\cIt's for my [STR_VAR_1].\nIf the choices were [STR_VAR_2] or\r[STR_VAR_3], which would be better?
Oh… Okay!\nI'll try that [STR_VAR_1].\cI hope I can teach that move…\nThis is so nerve-racking…\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\ras helpful.
Hm? You appear to be [PLAYER][KUN]…\nBut are you really real?\cPerhaps you're one of those popular\nmimics?\cNo, no, if you are real, it's fine.\nNo need to be upset, I assure you!\cIncidentally, I would like to obtain\nyour advice.\cIt's about my [STR_VAR_1].\cWhich move would be better for it to\nuse, [STR_VAR_2] or [STR_VAR_3]?
[STR_VAR_1]?\nThere's no question about that?\cI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\cI do hope it is something even\nmy POKéMON can learn.\cLet us meet again!
Oh… [PLAYER]?\nIt is [PLAYER]!\rOh! Sniff…sob… Please, listen!\cI… When I battle, I get so nervous,\nI can't help crying even if I win…\cI wish I could say something cool\nwhen I win…\cPlease, please, [PLAYER]!\nCould you maybe teach me something\rcool to say when I win so I don't cry?
[STR_VAR_1]\cAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\nIt's really cool!\cOh… I'm sorry…\nI'm so happy, I'm crying…\cSnivel… [PLAYER]!\nThank you so much for everything!\cI will battle the best I can for\nyour sake, [PLAYER]!\c[PLAYER]…\nNext time… We should battle!
Yay! It's [PLAYER]! Hello!\nI wanted to ask you something!\cI want to say something cool when\nI win a match.\cDo you have a cool saying that\nyou could recommend?
[STR_VAR_1]\cOh, wow! That is so cool!\nOkay, I'll say that!\cThanks for teaching me all this time!\nI'm going to do the best I can\rwherever I go from now on!\cWhen we meet again, it'll be for\na battle!
[PLAYER], hello!\cMy POKéMON and I are ready for\nanything, except for one thing.\cI think it would be good if I had\nsomething to shout when I win.\cCould you think up something good\nto say?
[STR_VAR_1]\c…Cool!\nI will use that!\cI'm going out to battle all over\nthe place.\cWho knows, I may even get to battle\nyou one day, [PLAYER].\cNext time, let's meet at a place\nof battle!
Hello, [PLAYER]…\nI'm sorry to bug you, but I'm hopeless…\cEven when…\nEven when I win, I don't have anything\rspecial to say…\cI know that it doesn't mean anything\nto you, [PLAYER].\cBut it means a lot to me…\cPlease, [PLAYER], what should I say\nif I win a battle?
[STR_VAR_1]\cThat's inspired…\cUh… Is it okay for someone like me\nto even say that?\cNo! I'll do my best!\c[PLAYER], thank you so much for\nputting up with me for so long…\cI promise to do my best from now on.\cI'm sure you'll quickly forget about\nsomeone like me, but let's meet\rsomewhere again!
Oh, [PLAYER][KUN].\nThere's something I want you to hear.\cI know that I don't always sound\nnice or polite…\cWhen I win a battle, I think I come\nacross as being arrogant.\cI don't want people to dislike me,\nso I want to say something nice to\rsomeone I beat.\cBut I can't think of anything good!\nCould you think something up for me?
[STR_VAR_1]\cNot bad!\nYup, that's what I'll go with!\cI'm going to hit the road and do what\nI can with what you taught me in\rmy head and heart.\cI'm sorry that I've been so pushy\nwith you!\cNext time, we battle, okay?\nSee you!
Oh, I can't get over how busy I am!\nOh, hey, I was looking for you, [PLAYER][KUN].\cAre you well as usual?\nThings haven't changed for me at all.\cI've got running, fighting, and mapping\nto do. Why am I so busy?\cBut even though I'm busy, it'd be rude\nto just turn on my heels and walk away\rfrom a win without saying a word.\cSo, what would be a cool saying to\nunderline my coolness when I'm done\rand walking away? [PLAYER][KUN], help me!
[STR_VAR_1]\cOkay, gotcha.\nI can find time to say that!\cHonestly, I'm glad I met a good mentor\nlike you.\cI'm going to make time somehow so\nI can get into battling.\cThanks for everything, [PLAYER][KUN]!\nWe have to battle, you and me, one day!
I lucked out again!\n[PLAYER]! Am I glad to see you!\rLike usual, I need your advice!\cDrum roll, please!\nThe last question I have is…\cIf I win a battle and want to end\nit with a cool flourish, what\rshould I say?
[STR_VAR_1]\cThat… That's fabulous!\nIt's dignified and cool! I claim it!\c…Listen, I think I'm getting decent\nat this, huh?\cSo, I'm thinking of challenging other\nTRAINERS from now on.\c[PLAYER], your advice really helped me.\cMaybe one day, there'll be a time when\nwe battle!\cThank you for everything!
Oh, [PLAYER].\nI'm so glad I met you!\cI no longer have any concerns with\nregard to my POKéMON.\cIt's myself that worries me…\cDo you know how a TRAINER says\na few things upon winning a battle?\cDefinitely, I wish I could do that,\ntoo!\cPlease, what should I say when\nI win a battle?
[STR_VAR_1]\cAh! That saying! It refreshes me\nand makes me feel reborn!\cI must use that right away!\cAnd now, I must take my leave,\n[PLAYER]…\cI will go out to battle many others,\nbut never will I forget your teachings.\cPerhaps one day…\nFarewell!
Eek! I spotted [PLAYER]!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you!\cOh-oh-oh! There's something I just\nhad to ask you!\cA little while ago, I won a battle.\nThat part was giddying!\cBut it made me so overjoyed that\nI choked up and couldn't say a thing!\cSo now, [PLAYER], please, I want you to\nthink up an exit line for when I win!
[STR_VAR_1]\cWaaaaah!\nI'm going to say that?!\rI… I'm delirious with joy!\cTh-th-thank you!\nI have nothing left to regret now!\cI'm going to travel now and battle\nall sorts of people.\cEverything, I owe it to you, [PLAYER].\nReally, really, thank you!\cI've got to go now, but let's meet\nin battle one day!
Hola, bueno!\n[PLAYER][KUN]!\cYou know, I'm getting the itch to roam\nand battle where I may.\cBut before I do, I want your advice\nonce again, please!\cIf I were to win a battle, what would\nbe a good boast I could say to my\rfallen TRAINER opponent?
[STR_VAR_1]\cUh-huh, that's sweet!\nSi, bueno!\rI'll try saying that, like, ham!\cAnd now, it's time to say good-bye!\nThanks for all sorts of things!\cGive me a battle one day, OK?\nAdios!
[PLAYER][KUN], there's big trouble!\cWhen I win a battle, I brag about it\nfor an hour at least!\cOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\cThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at chatting.\cSo, how about deciding for me what\nI should say after winning a battle,\rmaster?
[STR_VAR_1]\cThat's what I should say, huh?\nThen, I'll stay away from that!\cJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\cThanks for teaching me all this time,\nmaster!\cI'm finally understanding what being\na TRAINER is about.\cI'm going to go out and win battles\nagainst any TRAINER.\cMaybe it'll be you one day, master!\cThat's all!\nFarewell, my master!
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\cThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nThis will be my last question,\rdon't you cry!\cIt's a saying question\nthat begs your suggestion!\cIf I win a match, what can I say\nin a real cool way?
[STR_VAR_1]\cPerfect! That's what I'll use.\nI was right to make you choose!\cAnd now, I think it'd be best,\nif I were to fly the nest!\cThanks for all you taught me.\nI'll be off on a battle spree!\cB-O-N-V-O-Y-A-G-E!\nAnd that spells bon voyage,\rto you this is my homage!
Oh, yeah, [PLAYER]!\nI found you again today!\cWhat should I do? Ask you again?\nWhy not? I'm already asking you!\cAnyways, [PLAYER]…\nAre you receiving me?\rYou are receiving me!\rI need some more advice for me!\cIt's about what I should yell.\nSomething cool to holler when\ra battle ends well.\cCome on, I wanna hear you say it!
[STR_VAR_1]\cAll right, all right!\nI'll use that because it's so tight!\cI'm out of things to ask you.\nWaving bye is all that's left to do.\cBut maybe one day we'll meet, with one\ndestined to go down in defeat.\cBut, it really is time to say farewell.\cWell, [PLAYER], I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me!\cTake care, [PLAYER]!\nLove ya!
[PLAYER][KUN], I'm finished…\nMy nose won't stop dripping…\cI was trying to think up something\ncool to say when I win a battle.\cIt inspired me so much, it made me cry,\nand now my nose won't stop running…\cSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me, [PLAYER][KUN].\cWhen I win a battle,\nwhat should I say?
[STR_VAR_1]\c… … …That's good.\nNo, it's awe inspiring!\rIt's bringing fresh tears to my eyes!\cBut in spite of my tears and runny\nnose, I will use that saying!\cI'm plumb out of things to ask you,\n[PLAYER][KUN].\cFrom now on, we're rivals!\nThanks for everything!
Er… Um…\n[PLAYER][KUN]…\cPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me all nervous.\cI… I need your advice again.\nI'll make it my last, though…\cIt's really embarrassing to ask,\nbut what if I win a battle?\rWhat should I say?
[STR_VAR_1]\cOh… Okay!\nI'll try to say that!\rI might be too nervous to say it…\cThank you, [PLAYER][KUN].\nI have to say good-bye now.\cI'll obey all that you've taught me,\n[PLAYER][KUN], and do the best I can.

[STR_VAR_1]\c… … … … … …\nWhen I win a match…\c[STR_VAR_1]\c…Are you serious?\cI see.

BLEND MASTER: Indeed I am!\nThe BLEND MASTER am I!\cBlend with me, and you shall witness\nthe mastery I bring to blending!
BLEND MASTER: Hmmm! So, you wish to\nsee my mastery in action?
Hmmm!\cSo, you are too busy now, I see!\cBut fear not!\nI shall be here all day!\rHurry back from your errand!
Hmmm!\cYou haven't got a single BERRY!\cI shall be here all day!\nHurry back with some BERRIES!
Of course!\nOf course!\cIncidentally…\nYou do know how to blend [POKEBLOCK]S\rfrom BERRIES?
Hmmm!\cAh, but it is a simple process!\cWhen the BLENDER's arrow comes to\nyour marker, just press the A Button.\cThat's all you have to do.\cWhen you see how precisely I press\nthe A Button, you will understand.
Fine!\cLet's get started, then!\cAll together with the BLEND MASTER,\nlet's BERRY BLENDER!
Hmmm!\cYou don't appear to have gotten\nthe [POKEBLOCK] CASE!\cI shall be here all day!\nObtain the [POKEBLOCK] CASE and hurry back!
Hmmm!\cYour [POKEBLOCK] CASE appears to be full!\cI shall be here all day!\nUse some [POKEBLOCK]S and hurry back!
Whoa!\nAwesome!
Wickedly fast!
What an expert!
When I blended with the MASTER,\nwe made amazing [POKEBLOCK]S!
Eyes that track the arrow with\nmachinelike intensity…\cA hand that taps the A Button\nwith clockwork-like precision…\cPossessing these qualities makes\nthe BLEND MASTER truly great.
The BLEND MASTER's supposed to work\non his skills deep in the mountains.\cSometimes, he comes to LILYCOVE\nto blend BERRIES all day long.
I welcome you to the BATTLE TENT\nFALLARBOR SITE!\cI am your guide to the Set KO Tourney!
Now, do you wish to take the challenge\nof a Set KO Tourney?
We await your challenge on\nanother occasion!
In the FALLARBOR BATTLE TENT,\nwe undertake the Set KO Tourney.\cAll participants enter with a team of\nthree POKéMON.\cThe three POKéMON must be lined up\nin the order that they are to appear in.\cDuring battle, the POKéMON will appear\none at a time in the preset order.\cOnce a POKéMON enters battle, it must\nremain out until the match is decided.\cIf a match remains undecided in\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\cIf you wish to interrupt your challenge,\nplease save the game.\cIf you don't save, you will not be able\nto continue with your challenge.\cIf you pull off the feat of beating\nthree TRAINERS in succession,\rwe will present you with a fine prize.

[PLAYER] received the prize\n[STR_VAR_1].
The Battle Swap rules are listed.
Which heading do you want to read?
In a Battle Swap event, you may use\nonly three POKéMON.\cWhether you are renting or swapping,\nyour team may not have two or more\rof the same POKéMON.
You may swap POKéMON only with\nthe TRAINER you have just defeated.\cYou may swap for only those POKéMON\nused by the beaten TRAINER.
After every battle you win, you may\nswap for one of your defeated\ropponent's POKéMON.\cYou will not be able to swap POKéMON\nwith the third TRAINER in the event.
There are two key points to be aware\nof when swapping POKéMON.\cFirst, when swapping, you can't check\nthe stats of the POKéMON you are\rabout to receive.\cSecond, the POKéMON on your team\nare lined up in sequence, depending on\rthe order in which you rented them.\cThis sequence remains unchanged\neven when swaps are made.
The POKéMON of the SLATEPORT\nBATTLE TENT are all rentals.\cAll rental POKéMON are kept at\nLevel 30.
The VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT\nrules are listed.
Which heading do you want to read?
Here at the VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT,\nPOKéMON are required to think and\rbattle by themselves.\cUnlike in the wild, POKéMON that live\nwith people behave differently\rdepending on their nature.
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON\nmay prefer to attack no matter what.\cAnother POKéMON may prefer to protect\nitself from any harm.\cYet another may enjoy vexing or\nconfounding its foes.\cDepending on its nature, a POKéMON\nwill have favorite moves that it is good\rat using.\cIt may also dislike certain moves that\nit has trouble using.
There are offensive moves that inflict\ndirect damage on the foe.\cThere are defensive moves that are\nused to prepare for enemy attacks or\rused to heal HP and so on.\cThere are also other somewhat-odd\nmoves that may enfeeble the foes with\rstat problems including poison and \rparalysis.\cPOKéMON will consider using moves in\nthese three categories.
When not under command by its TRAINER,\na POKéMON may be unable to effectively\ruse certain moves.\cA POKéMON is not good at using any\nmove that it dislikes.\cIf a POKéMON only knows moves that\ndo not match its nature, it will often\rbe unable to live up to its potential.
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON may\nstart using moves that don't match its\rnature when it is in trouble.\cIf a POKéMON begins behaving oddly\nin a pinch, watch it carefully.
At this BATTLE TENT, the levels of\nyour opponents will be adjusted to\rmatch the levels of your POKéMON.\cHowever, no TRAINER you face will\nhave any POKéMON below Level 30.
The VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT\nrules are listed.
What's up, youngster?\cWhat, it's you who's supposed to have\na tattered old map?\cLet's have a look.\n… … … … … …\cBoy, this is quite a ways away.\nI'm afraid I can't help you…
BRINEY: Hold on a second!\cWhat's the idea of turning down\nsomeone that I owe so much to?
[PLAYER][KUN], I'm terribly sorry.\cYou came to me seeking my help,\nand we almost turned you away.\cWell, let me make things right.\cWe'll sail right away, of course!\cLet's find this island on\nthis OLD SEA MAP!
Is it you who brought that odd\nticket?\cWhere you're trying to go is an island\nthat's far, far away.\cNo one knows what awaits there…\cThe very thought excites my blood\nas a sailing man!\cGet on board, youngster!
CAPT. BRINEY can be so maddeningly\nfickle…\cDo you want to return to LILYCOVE?
What an oddly shaped island, eh?\nDo you want to return to LILYCOVE?
Is it you who brought those\nodd tickets?\c… … …Hm.\cThese tickets will get you to islands\nthat are far, far away.\cNo one knows what awaits there,\nor what may happen there.\cThe very thought excites my blood\nas a sailing man!\cGet on board, youngster!\nWhere shall we sail first?
Did… Did you hear that?\nThat low growling from deep in there.\cAre you sure it's safe?\nDo you think we should leave?
The writing is fading as if it was\nwritten a long time ago…\c“…ber, 6th day\nIf any human…sets foot here…\ragain…et it be a kindhearted pers…\r…ith that hope, I depar…”
Myuu…
This move can be learned only\nonce. Is that okay?
Heh! My POKéMON totally rules!\nIt's cooler than any POKéMON!\cI was lipping off with a swagger in\nmy step like that when the CHAIRMAN\rchewed me out.\cThat took the swagger out of my step.\cIf you'd like, I'll teach the move\nSWAGGER to a POKéMON of yours.
What, no? Can't you get into\nthe spirit of things?
All right, which POKéMON wants to\nlearn how to SWAGGER?
I'll just praise my POKéMON from now\non without the swagger.
Did you know that you can go from\nhere a long way in that direction\rwithout changing direction?\cI might even be able to roll\nthat way.\cDo you think your POKéMON will\nwant to roll, too?\cI can teach one the move ROLLOUT\nif you'd like.
You don't need to be shy about it.\nLet's roll!
Ehehe, sure thing! It'd be great if\nthe POKéMON looked like me.
Rolling around in the grass makes me\nhappy. Come on, let's roll!
There's a move that gets stronger\nwhen you keep using it in a row.\cIt's a BUG-type move, and it is\nwickedly cool.\cIt's called FURY CUTTER.\nWant me to teach it to a POKéMON?
We're not on the same wavelength.
Yay!\nShow me which POKéMON I should teach.
I get a thrill watching to see if\nthe move keeps hitting in succession!
Ah, young one!\cI am also a young one, but I mimic\nthe styles and speech of the elderly\rfolks of this town.\cWhat do you say, young one?\nWould you agree to it if I were to\roffer to teach the move MIMIC?
Oh, boo! I wanted to teach MIMIC\nto your POKéMON!
Fwofwo! And so I shall!\nLet me see the POKéMON\ryou wish me to teach.
MIMIC is a move of great depth.\cCould you execute it to perfection\nas well as me…?
I want all sorts of things!\nBut I used up my allowance…\cWouldn't it be nice if there were\na spell that made money appear when\ryou waggle a finger?\cIf you want, I can teach your POKéMON\nthe move METRONOME.\cMoney won't appear, but your POKéMON\nwill waggle a finger. Yes?
Okay. I'll be here if you change\nyour mind.
Okay! I'll teach it!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?
When a POKéMON waggles its finger\nlike a METRONOME, all sorts of nice\rthings happen.\cWouldn't it be nice if we could\nuse it, too?
Humph! My wife relies on HIDDEN\nPOWER to stay awake.\cShe should just take a nap like I do,\nand SLEEP TALK.\cI can teach your POKéMON how to\nSLEEP TALK instead. Interested?
Oh, fine, fine. You want to stay awake\nwith HIDDEN POWER, too…
Ah, an appreciative child!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?
I've never once gotten my wife's\ncoin trick right.\cI would be happy if I got it right\neven as I SLEEP TALK…
When I see the wide world from up\nhere on the roof…\cI think about how nice it would be\nif there were more than just one me\rso I could enjoy all sorts of lives.\cOf course it's not possible.\nGiggle…\cI know! Would you be interested in\nhaving a POKéMON learn SUBSTITUTE?
Oh, no?\cA POKéMON can make a copy of\nitself using it, you know.
Giggle…\nWhich POKéMON do you want me to\rteach SUBSTITUTE?
We human beings should enjoy our\nown lives to the utmost!\cI hope you'll get that way, too!
I can't do this anymore!\cIt's utterly hopeless!\cI'm a FIGHTING-type TRAINER,\nso I can't win at the MOSSDEEP GYM\rno matter how hard I try!\cArgh! Punch! Punch! Punch!\nPunch! Punch! Punch!\cWhat, don't look at me that way!\nI'm only hitting the ground!\cOr do you want me to teach your\nPOKéMON DYNAMICPUNCH?
Darn! You're even making fun of me?\nPunch! Punch! Punch!
What? You do? You're a good person!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?
I want you to win at the MOSSDEEP GYM\nusing that DYNAMICPUNCH!
Sigh…\cSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER is really\nlovably admirable.\cBut that also means I have many\nrivals for his attention.\cHe's got appeal with a DOUBLE-EDGE.\nI couldn't even catch his eye.\cPlease, let me teach your POKéMON\nthe move DOUBLE-EDGE!
Oh…\nEven you rejected me…
Okay, which POKéMON should I teach\nDOUBLE-EDGE?
I won't live for love anymore!\nI'll become tough!
I don't intend to be going nowhere\nfast in the sticks like this forever.\cYou watch me, I'll get out to the city\nand become a huge hit.\cSeriously, I'm going to cause\na huge EXPLOSION of popularity!\cIf you overheard that, I'll happily\nteach EXPLOSION to your POKéMON!
Gaah! You're turning me down because\nI live in the country?
Fine! An EXPLOSION it is!\nWhich POKéMON wants to blow up?
For a long time, I've taught POKéMON\nhow to use EXPLOSION, but I've yet\rto ignite my own EXPLOSION…\cMaybe it's because deep down,\nI would rather stay here…
This is a test message.\nThis is a signpost.
It's very disappointing…
Okay, I understand…
I'm terribly sorry…
Thank you…
Ahahaha! Aren't you embarrassed?\nEveryone's watching!
Grr…\nWhat the…
My DOME ACE title isn't just for show!
Ahahaha!\nYou're inspiring!
Way to work!\nThat was a good lesson, eh?
Good job!\nYou know what you're doing!
Hey, hey, hey!\nYou're finished already?
What happened here?
Humph…
Urk…
Hah!
Darn!
Oh, come on!\nYou have to try harder than that!
No way!\nGood job!
Heheh!\nWhat did you expect?
Huh?\nAre you serious?!
Your POKéMON are wimpy because\nyou're wimpy as a TRAINER!
Ah…\nNow this is something else…
Gwahahaha!\nMy brethren, we have nothing to fear!
Gwah!\nHahahaha!
Hey! What's wrong with you!\nLet's see some effort! Get up!
That's it! You've done great!\nYou've worked hard for this!
Hey! Don't you give up now!\nGet up! Don't lose faith in yourself!
That's it! You've done it!\nYou kept working for this!

Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\cWelcome to the world of POKéMON!\cMy name is BIRCH.\cBut everyone calls me the POKéMON\nPROFESSOR.\c
This is what we call a “POKéMON.”\c\n
This world is widely inhabited by\ncreatures known as POKéMON.\cWe humans live alongside POKéMON,\nat times as friendly playmates, and\rat times as cooperative workmates.\cAnd sometimes, we band together\nand battle others like us.\cBut despite our closeness, we don't\nknow everything about POKéMON.\cIn fact, there are many, many\nsecrets surrounding POKéMON.\cTo unravel POKéMON mysteries,\nI've been undertaking research.\rThat's what I do.\c
And you are?
Are you a boy?\nOr are you a girl?
All right.\nWhat's your name?
So it's [PLAYER][KUN]?
Ah, okay!\cYou're [PLAYER][KUN] who's moving to my\nhometown of LITTLEROOT.\rI get it now!\c
All right, are you ready?\cYour very own adventure is about\nto unfold.\cTake courage, and leap into the\nworld of POKéMON where dreams,\radventure, and friendships await!\cWell, I'll be expecting you later.\nCome see me in my POKéMON LAB.\c

----------

This is a newly discovered POKéMON.\nIt is currently under investigation.\nNo detailed information is available\nat this time.
BULBASAUR can be seen napping in bright\nsunlight. There is a seed on its back.\nBy soaking up the sun's rays, the seed\ngrows progressively larger.
To support its bulb, IVYSAUR's legs\ngrow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in\nthe sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into\na large flower.
VENUSAUR's flower is said to take on vivid\ncolors if it gets plenty of nutrition and\nsunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the\nemotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its\ntail is an indication of its emotions.\nThe flame wavers when CHARMANDER is\nhappy, and blazes when it is enraged.
Without pity, its sharp claws destroy foes.\nIf it encounters a strong enemy, it\nbecomes agitated, and the flame on its\ntail flares with a bluish white color.
A CHARIZARD flies about in search of\nstrong opponents. It breathes intense\nflames that can melt any material. However,\nit will never torch a weaker foe.
Its shell is not just for protection.\nIts rounded shape and the grooves on its\nsurface minimize resistance in water,\nenabling SQUIRTLE to swim at high speeds.
Its large tail is covered with rich, thick\nfur that deepens in color with age.\nThe scratches on its shell are evidence\nof this POKéMON's toughness in battle.
The waterspouts that protrude from its\nshell are highly accurate. Their bullets of\nwater can precisely nail tin cans from\na distance of over 160 feet.
Its voracious appetite compels it to\ndevour leaves bigger than itself without\nhesitation. It releases a terribly strong\nodor from its antennae.
Its shell is as hard as an iron slab.\nA METAPOD does not move very much\nbecause it is preparing its soft innards\nfor evolution inside the shell.
It has a superior ability to search for\ndelicious honey from flowers. It can seek,\nextract, and carry honey from flowers\nblooming over six miles away.
A WEEDLE has an extremely acute sense\nof smell. It distinguishes its favorite\nkinds of leaves from those it dislikes by\nsniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
It remains virtually immobile while it\nclings to a tree. However, on the inside,\nit busily prepares for evolution. This is\nevident from how hot its shell becomes.
A BEEDRILL is extremely territorial.\nFor safety reasons, no one should \never approach its nest. If angered,\nthey will attack in a swarm.
It has an extremely sharp sense of\ndirection. It can unerringly return home to\nits nest, however far it may be removed\nfrom its familiar surroundings.
This POKéMON flies around, patrolling its\nlarge territory. If its living space is\nviolated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly\npunishing the foe with its sharp claws.
This POKéMON has gorgeous, glossy\nfeathers. Many TRAINERS are so captivated\nby the beautiful feathers on its head that\nthey choose PIDGEOT as their POKéMON.
A RATTATA is cautious in the extreme.\nEven while it is asleep, it constantly\nmoves its ears and listens for danger.\nIt will make its nest anywhere.
A RATICATE's sturdy fangs grow steadily.\nTo keep them ground down, it gnaws on\nrocks and logs. It may even chew on the\nwalls of houses.
Its loud cry can be heard over half a mile\naway. If its high, keening cry is heard\nechoing all around, it is a sign that they\nare warning each other of danger.
Its long neck and elongated beak are\nideal for catching prey in soil or water.\nIt deftly moves this extended and skinny\nbeak to pluck prey.
An EKANS curls itself up in a spiral while\nit rests. This position allows it to quickly\nrespond to an enemy from any direction\nwith a threat from its upraised head.
This POKéMON has a terrifically strong\nconstricting power. It can even flatten\nsteel oil drums. Once it wraps its body\naround its foe, escaping is impossible.
It stores electricity in the electric sacs\non its cheeks. When it releases pent-up\nenergy in a burst, the electric power is\nequal to a lightning bolt.
If it stores too much electricity, its\nbehavior turns aggressive. To avoid this,\nit occasionally discharges excess energy\nand calms itself down.
When it curls up in a ball, it can make any\nattack bounce off harmlessly. Its hide has\nturned tough and solid as a result of\nliving in the desert.
It curls up in a ball to protect itself from\nenemy attacks. It also curls up to prevent\nheatstroke during the daytime when\ntemperatures rise sharply.
Its highly toxic barbs are thought to have\ndeveloped as protection for this small-\nbodied POKéMON. When enraged, it releases\na horrible toxin from its horn.
When it is with its friends or\nfamily, its barbs are tucked away to\nprevent injury. It appears to become\nnervous if separated from the others.
It is adept at sending foes flying with\nharsh tackles using its tough, scaly body.\nThis POKéMON is at its strongest when\nit is defending its young.
The male NIDORAN has developed muscles\nthat freely move its ears in any direction.\nEven the slightest sound does not escape\nthis POKéMON's notice.
Its horn is harder than a diamond.\nIf it senses a hostile presence, all the\nbarbs on its back bristle up at once, and it\nchallenges the foe with all its might.
A NIDOKING's thick tail packs enormously\ndestructive power capable of toppling\na metal transmission tower. Once it goes\non a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, they come\nout to play. When dawn arrives, the tired\nCLEFAIRY go to sleep nestled up against\neach other in deep and quiet mountains.
A CLEFABLE uses its wings to skip lightly \nas if it were flying. Its bouncy step\nlets it even walk on water. On quiet,\nmoonlit nights, it strolls on lakes.
It can freely control fire, making fiery\norbs fly like will-o'-the-wisps. Just\nbefore evolution, its six tails grow hot \nas if on fire.
It has long been said that each of the\nnine tails embody an enchanted power.\nA long-lived NINETALES will have fur that\nshines like gold.
Nothing can avoid falling asleep hearing a\nJIGGLYPUFF's song. The sound waves of its\nsinging voice match the brain waves of\nsomeone in a deep sleep.
Its fur is the ultimate in luxuriousness.\nSleeping alongside a WIGGLYTUFF is simply\ndivine. Its body expands seemingly without\nend when it inhales.
While living in pitch-black caverns, their\neyes gradually grew shut and deprived\nthem of vision. They use ultrasonic waves\nto detect obstacles.
Its fangs easily puncture even thick\nanimal hide. It loves to feast on the blood\nof people and POKéMON. It flits about in\ndarkness and strikes from behind.
This POKéMON grows by absorbing moonlight.\nDuring the daytime, it buries itself in the\nground, leaving only its leaves exposed to\navoid detection by its enemies.
A horribly noxious honey drools from its\nmouth. One whiff of the honey can result\nin memory loss. Some fans are said to\nenjoy this overwhelming stink, however.
In seasons when it produces more pollen,\nthe air around a VILEPLUME turns yellow\nwith the powder as it walks. The pollen is\nhighly toxic and causes paralysis.
A PARAS has parasitic tochukaso\nmushrooms growing on its back. They grow\nby drawing nutrients from the host. They\nare valued as a medicine for long life.
PARASECT are known to infest the roots of\nlarge trees en masse and drain nutrients.\nWhen an infested tree dies, they move\nonto another tree all at once.
Its coat of thin, stiff hair that covers\nits entire body is said to have evolved\nfor protection. Its large eyes never fail\nto spot even miniscule prey.
VENOMOTH are nocturnal--they only are\nactive at night. Their favorite prey are\ninsects that gather around streetlights,\nattracted by the light in the darkness.
DIGLETT are raised in most farms.\nThe reason is simple--wherever they\nburrow, the soil is left perfectly tilled\nfor growing delicious crops.
Because the triplets originally split from\none body, they think exactly alike.\nThey work cooperatively to burrow\nendlessly through the ground.
MEOWTH withdraw their sharp claws into\ntheir paws to silently sneak about.\nFor some reason, this POKéMON loves\nshiny coins that glitter with light.
A PERSIAN's six bold whiskers sense air\nmovements to determine what is in its\nvicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed\nby the whiskers.
When its headache intensifies, it starts\nusing strange powers. However, it has no\nrecollection of its powers, so it always\nlooks befuddled and bewildered.
A GOLDUCK is an adept swimmer.\nIt sometimes joins competitive swimmers\nin training. It uses psychic powers when\nits forehead shimmers with light.
When it starts shaking and its nasal\nbreathing turns rough, it's a sure sign\nof anger. However, since this happens\ninstantly, there is no time to flee.
When it becomes furious, its blood\ncirculation becomes more robust, and\nits muscles are made stronger. But it\nalso becomes much less intelligent.
Its superb sense of smell ensures that\nthis POKéMON won't forget any scent,\nno matter what. It uses its sense of smell\nto detect the emotions of others.
This fleet-footed POKéMON is said to run\nover 6,200 miles in a single day and night.\nThe fire that blazes wildly within its body\nis its source of power.
It is possible to see this POKéMON's spiral\ninnards right through its thin skin.\nHowever, the skin is also very flexible.\nEven sharp fangs bounce right off it.
Its body surface is always wet and slick\nwith an oily fluid. Because of this greasy\ncovering, it can easily slip and slide out\nof the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Its highly developed muscles never grow\nfatigued, however much it exercises.\nThis POKéMON can swim back and forth\nacross the Pacific Ocean without effort.
A POKéMON that sleeps 18 hours a day.\nObservation revealed that it uses\nTELEPORT to change its location once\nevery hour.
It is rumored that a boy with psychic\nabilities suddenly transformed into\nKADABRA while he was assisting research\ninto extrasensory powers.
While it has strong psychic abilities and\nhigh intelligence, an ALAKAZAM's muscles\nare very weak. It uses psychic power to\nmove its body.
It continually undertakes strenuous\ntraining to master all forms of martial\narts. Its strength lets it easily hoist\na sumo wrestler onto its shoulders.
A belt is worn by a MACHOKE to keep its\noverwhelming power under control.\nBecause it is so dangerous, no one has\never removed the belt.
It is impossible to defend against punches\nand chops doled out by its four arms.\nIts fighting spirit flares up when it faces\na tough opponent.
A BELLSPROUT's thin and flexible body lets\nit bend and sway to avoid any attack,\nhowever strong it may be. From its mouth,\nit leaks a fluid that melts even iron.
At night, a WEEPINBELL hangs on to a tree\nbranch with its hooked rear and sleeps.\nIf it moves around in its sleep, it may\nwake up to find itself on the ground.
The long vine extending from its head is\nwaved about as if it were a living thing to\nattract prey. When an unsuspecting victim\napproaches, it is swallowed whole.
Its body is almost entirely composed of\nwater. It ensnares its foe with its two\nlong tentacles, then stabs with the poison\nstingers at their tips.
It lives in complex rock formations on\nthe ocean floor and traps prey using its\n80 tentacles. Its red orbs glow when it\ngrows excited or agitated.
It climbs mountain paths using only the\npower of its arms. Because they look just\nlike boulders lining paths, hikers may step\non them without noticing.
They descend from mountains by tumbling\ndown steep slopes. They are so brutal,\nthey smash aside obstructing trees and\nmassive boulders with thunderous tackles.
It is said to live in volcanic craters\non mountain peaks. Once a year, it sheds\nits hide and grows larger. The shed hide\ncrumbles and returns to the soil.
A PONYTA is very weak at birth. It can\nbarely stand up. Its legs become stronger\nas it stumbles and falls while trying to\nkeep up with its parent.
It usually canters casually in the fields\nand plains. But once a RAPIDASH turns\nserious, its fiery manes flare and blaze\nas it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
It catches prey by dipping its tail in\nwater at the side of a river. But it often\nforgets what it is doing and spends entire\ndays just loafing at water's edge.
Its tail has a SHELLDER firmly attached\nwith a bite. As a result, the tail can't be\nused for fishing anymore. This forces it\nto reluctantly swim and catch prey.
The units at its sides are extremely\npowerful magnets. They generate enough\nmagnetism to draw in iron objects from\nover 300 feet away.
It is actually three MAGNEMITE linked\nby magnetism. It generates powerful radio\nwaves that raise temperatures by 3.6\ndegrees F within a 3,300-foot radius.
It is always seen with a stick from a plant.\nApparently, there are good sticks and bad\nsticks. This POKéMON occasionally fights\nwith others over choice sticks.
Even while eating or sleeping, one of the\nheads remains always vigilant for any sign\nof danger. When threatened, it flees at\nover 60 miles per hour.
A peculiar POKéMON species with three\nheads. It vigorously races across grassy\nplains even in arid seasons with little\nrainfall.
SEEL hunt for prey in frigid, ice-covered\nseas. When it needs to breathe, it punches\na hole through the ice with the sharply\nprotruding section of its head.
It loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice.\nThe sight of this POKéMON sleeping on\na glacier was mistakenly thought to be\na mermaid by a mariner long ago.
Born from polluted sludge in the sea,\nGRIMER's favorite food is anything filthy.\nThey feed on wastewater pumped out from\nfactories.
It prefers warm and humid habitats.\nIn the summertime, the toxic substances\nin its body intensify, making MUK reek like\nputrid kitchen garbage.
At night, it burrows a hole in the seafloor\nwith its broad tongue to make a place to\nsleep. While asleep, it closes its shell,\nbut leaves its tongue hanging out.
It swims in the sea by swallowing water,\nthen jetting it out toward the rear.\nThe CLOYSTER shoots spikes from its\nshell using the same system.
