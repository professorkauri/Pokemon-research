I came here with some friends to\ncatch us some BUG POKéMON!\cThey're all itching to get into\nsome POKéMON battles!
Hey! You have POKéMON!\nCome on!\rLet's battle 'em!
No!\nCATERPIE can't hack it!
Ssh! You'll scare the bugs away.\nAnother time, okay?
Yo!\nYou can't jam out if you're a\rPOKéMON TRAINER!
Huh?\nI ran out of POKéMON!
That totally stinks! I'm going to\ncatch some stronger ones!
Hey, wait up!\nWhat's the hurry? Why the rush?
I give!\nYou're good at this!
Sometimes, you can find stuff on\nthe ground.\cI'm looking for the stuff I\ndropped. Can you help me?
I might be little, but I won't like\nit if you go easy on me!
Oh, boo.\nNothing went right.
I lost some of my allowance…
Did you know that POKéMON evolve?
Oh!\nI lost!
BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.\nThey're a lot of fun!
I was throwing POKé BALLS to\ncatch POKéMON, and I ran out.\cThat's why you can never have too\nmany POKé BALLS.
TRAINER TIPS\cIf your POKéMON are weak and you\nwant to avoid battles, stay away\rfrom grassy areas!
For poison, use ANTIDOTE!\nGet it at POKéMON MARTS!
TRAINER TIPS\cContact PROF. OAK via a PC to\nget your POKéDEX evaluated!
TRAINER TIPS\cYou can't catch a POKéMON that\nbelongs to someone else.\cThrow POKé BALLS only at wild\nPOKéMON to catch them!
TRAINER TIPS\cWeaken POKéMON before attempting\ncapture!\cWhen healthy, they may escape!
LEAVING VIRIDIAN FOREST\nPEWTER CITY AHEAD
WHOA!\nYou shocked me!\r…Oh, you're just a kid!
Wow!\nShocked again!
Kids like you shouldn't be\nwandering around here in the dark.
Did you come to explore the cave,\ntoo?
Losing stinks!\nIt's so uncool.
I came all the way down here to\nshow off to girls.
Wow! It's way bigger in here than\nI thought!
Oh!\nI lost it!
How do you get out of here?\nIt's so big, I may get lost.
What!\nDon't sneak up on me!
My POKéMON won't do!
I have to find stronger POKéMON.\nWhere might they be?
What?\nI'm waiting for my friends to find\rme here.
I lost?
I came because I heard there are\nsome very rare fossils here.
Suspicious men are in the cave.\nWhat about you?
You got me!
I saw them!\nI'm sure they're from TEAM ROCKET!
You need to go through this cave\nto get to CERULEAN CITY.
I lost.
ZUBAT is tough!\nBut if you can catch one, you'll\rbe able to count on it.
Beware!\nZUBAT is a bloodsucker!
Hi, I'm excavating for fossils here\nunder MT. MOON.\cSometimes, BROCK of PEWTER GYM\nlends me a hand.
Hey, stop!\cI found these fossils!\nThey're both mine!
Okay!\nI'll share!
We'll each take a fossil!\nNo being greedy!
All right.\nThen this fossil is mine!
Far away, on CINNABAR ISLAND,\nthere's a POKéMON LAB.\cThey do research on regenerating\nfossils.
We, TEAM ROCKET, shall find the\nfossils!\cReviving POKéMON from them will\nearn us huge riches!
Urgh!\nNow I'm mad!
You made me mad!\nTEAM ROCKET will blacklist you!
We, TEAM ROCKET, are POKéMON\ngangsters!\rWe strike fear with our strength!
I blew it!
Darn it all!\nMy associates won't stand for this!
We're pulling a big job here!\nGet lost, kid!
So, you are good…
If you find a fossil, give it to me\nand scram!
Little kids shouldn't be messing\naround with grown-ups!\cIt could be bad news!
I'm steamed!
POKéMON lived here long before\npeople came.
Do you want the DOME FOSSIL?
Do you want the HELIX FOSSIL?
Obtained the HELIX FOSSIL!
Obtained the DOME FOSSIL!
Bonjour!\nI am le waiter on this ship!\cI will be happy to serve you\nanything you please!\c… … …\nAh! Le strong silent type!
The passengers are restless from\nthis long voyage.\cYou might be challenged by the\nmore bored ones!
This ship, she is a luxury liner for\nTRAINERS of the world!\cAt every port, we hold parties with\ninvited TRAINERS.
[RIVAL]: Bonjour!\n[PLAYER]!\cImagine seeing you here!\n[PLAYER], were you really invited?\cSo how's your POKéDEX coming?\cI already caught 40 kinds, pal.\nDifferent kinds are everywhere.\cCrawl around in grassy areas, and\nlook hard for them.
Humph!\cAt least you're raising your\nPOKéMON!
[PLAYER]…！\nふなよい　してるのか！\cもっと　からだ\nきたえた　ほうが　いいぜ！
[RIVAL]: I heard there was a CUT\nmaster on board.\cBut he was just a seasick old man!\cCUT itself is really useful.\nYup, it'll be handy.\cYou should go see him, too.\nSmell ya!
Our CAPTAIN is a sword master.\nHe's awesome at using CUT.\cThey say he even teaches CUT\nto POKéMON!
The party's over.\nThe ship will be departing soon.
Whew!\nScrubbing decks is hard work!
Urf… I feel ill…\cI got seasick, so I stepped out to\nget some air…
Hey, matey!\cLet's do a little jig!
You're impressive!
How many kinds of POKéMON do you\nthink there are in this big world?
Ahoy, there!\nAre you seasick?
I was just careless!
My pa said there are 100 kinds of\nPOKéMON. I think there are more.
You, mon petit!\nWe're busy here!\rOut of the way!
I saw an odd BERRY in the trash.\nI wonder what that was?
I'm so busy I'm getting dizzy!\nYou have to give me room here!
Hum-de-hum-de-ho…\cI peel spuds every day!\nHum-hum…
Did you hear about SNORLAX?\nIt's a glutton.\cNo other POKéMON eats and sleeps\nthe way SNORLAX can and does!
Snivel… Sniff…\cI only get to peel onions…\nSnivel…
Er-hem!\nIndeed I am le CHEF!\cLe main course is
Salmon du Salad!\cLes guests may gripe it's fish\nagain, however!
Eels au Barbecue!\cLes guests will mutiny, I fear.
Prime Beefsteak!\cBut, have I enough fillets du\nbeef?
CAPTAIN: Ooargh…\nI feel hideous…\rUrrp! Seasick…
[PLAYER] rubbed the CAPTAIN's\nback!\cRub-rub…\nRub-rub…
CAPTAIN: Whew! Thank you!\nI'm feeling much better now.\cYou want to see my hidden CUT\ntechnique?\cI could show you my prized CUT\ntechnique if I weren't so ill…\cI know! You can have this!\nThis HIDDEN MACHINE!\cTeach CUT to your POKéMON, and\nyou can see it CUT anytime!
[PLAYER] obtained HM01\nfrom the CAPTAIN!
Using CUT, you can chop down\nsmall trees.\cWhy not try it with the trees\naround VERMILION CITY?
CAPTAIN: …Whew!\cNow that I'm not sick anymore,\nI guess it's time.\cThe S.S. ANNE will set sail soon!\cFarewell, until our return to\nVERMILION CITY!
Oh, no!\nYou have no room for this!
Yuck!\nShouldn't have looked!
How to Conquer Seasickness…\nThe CAPTAIN's reading this!
Ssh…!\nI'm a GLOBAL POLICE agent.\cI'm on the trail of TEAM ROCKET.\nThey're up to nothing good!
I love POKéMON!\nDo you?
Wow! \nYou're great!
Listen, listen!\nLet me be your friend, okay?\cThen we can trade POKéMON and\ndo stuff.
I collected these POKéMON\nfrom all around the world!
Oh, no!\nI went around the world for these!
You hurt my poor POKéMON!\cI demand that you heal them at a\nPOKéMON CENTER!
We are cruising around the world,\nmy children and I.
A world cruise is so elegant yet\ncozy!
I always travel with WIGGLYTUFF.\nI never leave home without it.
WIGGLYTUFF: Puup pupuu!
Waiter, I would like a cherry pie,\nplease!
Waitress, I would like a cherry\npie, please!
You insolent pup!\nHow dare you barge in!
Humph! You rude child!\nYou have no sense of courtesy!
I wish to be left alone!\nGet out!
I am but a solitary traveler…\cMy sole companions and friends are\nPOKéMON I caught on my journeys…
My, my friends…
You should be nice to friends!
I've journeyed far and wide, but in\nall my travels I've never seen\rany POKéMON sleep like this one!\cIt was something like this!
Competing against the young keeps\nme youthful.
Good match!\nAh, I feel young again!
Fifteen years ago, I would\nhave won!
Check out what I fished up!
I'm all out!
Party?\cThe cruise ship's party should be\nover by now.
Ah, yes, I have seen some POKéMON\nferry people across the water!
Small trees can be chopped down\nusing the move CUT.\cBut remember this!\nCUT is an HM technique.\cOnce learned, it is not so easily\ndiscarded.
Which do you find more worthy,\na strong or a rare POKéMON?
I must salute you!
Personally, I prefer strong and\nrare POKéMON.
I don't believe I saw you at the\nparty?
Take it easy!
Oh, I adore your strong POKéMON!\nOh, how I envy you for them!
Have you gone to the SAFARI ZONE\nin FUCHSIA CITY?\cThere are many kinds of rare\nPOKéMON.
Me and my daddy think the SAFARI\nZONE is awesome!\rI wish we could go there again.
The CAPTAIN said he's awfully sick.\nHe was all pale.
I hear many people get seasick.
Matey, you're walking the plank if\nyou lose!
Argh!\nBeaten by a kid!
When we're out at sea, jellyfish\nPOKéMON sometimes drift by.
Hello, stranger!\cI can't tell if you're from the seas\nor mountains, but stop and chat.\cAll my POKéMON are from the sea.
Darn!\nI let that one get away!
I was going to make you my\nassistant, too!
Even us sailors have POKéMON, too!
Okay, you're not bad.
We caught all our POKéMON while\nwe were out at sea.
I like feisty kids like you!
Argh!\nLost it!
Sea POKéMON live in deep water.\nYou'll need a ROD to fish them up!
You know what they say about\nsailors and battling!
Right!\nGood battle, mate!
Hahaha!\nWant to be a sailor, mate?
Come on, then!\nMy sailor's pride is at stake!
Your spirit sank me!
Did you see the FISHING GURU in\nVERMILION CITY?
My buddy MACHOKE is super strong!\cHe has enough STRENGTH to move\nbig rocks!
MACHOKE: Gwoh! Goggoh!
You look tired. Would you like to\ntake a short rest?
I'm glad to see that everyone is\nlooking refreshed and chipper.
Oh, I'm sorry for fussing over you.\nYou look like my little brother…
Oh, I'm sorry for fussing over you.\nYou look like my little sister…
People often lose things in the\ndarkness of the UNDERGROUND PATH.
I heard a sleepy POKéMON appeared\nout near CELADON CITY, too.
The DEPARTMENT STORE in CELADON\nhas a great selection.\cDo you go there very often?
I went inside ROCK TUNNEL, but it's\npitch-black and scary in there.\cIf I could get a POKéMON to use\nFLASH and light it up…
Well, isn't this a surprise!\nDIGLETT dug this long tunnel!\cIt goes right to VIRIDIAN CITY,\nthey tell me.
I wonder if you are good enough\nfor me?
I lost out…
I never wanted to lose to anybody,\nespecially to a younger kid…
I can see you're good.\nLet me see exactly how good!
I had a chance…
Tch!\nI concede, you are better than I!
If you can get through here,\nyou can go meet the ELITE FOUR.
No!\nUnbelievable!
I can beat you when it comes to\nknowledge about POKéMON!
This here is VICTORY ROAD.\nIt's the final test for TRAINERS!
Atcho!
If you get stuck, try moving some\nboulders around.
Ah, so you wish to challenge the\nELITE FOUR?
You got me!
[RIVAL] also came through here.
Come on!\nI'll whip you!
I got whipped!
You earned the right to be on\nVICTORY ROAD…
Is VICTORY ROAD too tough?
Well done!
Many TRAINERS give up their\nchallenge here and go home.
ギヤーオ！
You should be proud of yourself,\nhaving battled your way through\rVICTORY ROAD so courageously.\cIn recognition of your feat,\nI'll teach you DOUBLE-EDGE.\cWould you like me to teach that\ntechnique?
I'll teach you the technique\nanytime.
Which POKéMON should I teach\nDOUBLE-EDGE?
Keep that drive going for the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE!\cTake a run at them and knock 'em\nout!
I heard rumors of a child prodigy.
The rumors were true!
So, it was you who beat GIOVANNI\nof TEAM ROCKET?
TRAINERS live to seek stronger\nopponents.
Oh!\nSo strong!
By fighting tough battles, you get\nstronger.
I'll show you just how good you\nare. Not!
I'm furious!
You showed me just how good\nI was…
Only the chosen can pass here!
I don't believe it!
All TRAINERS here are headed to\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE.\cDon't let down your guard.
RAY: Together, the two of us are\ndestined for greatness!
RAY: Ludicrous!\nThis can't be!
RAY: You've beaten us.\nGreatness remains elusive…
RAY: Together, the two of us are\nstriving for the pinnacle.\cWe need you to bring two POKéMON\ninto battle with us.
TYRA: We're trying to become\nchampions together.
TYRA: Oh, but…
TYRA: You've taught me that power\ncan be infinite in shape and form.
TYRA: You can't battle with us if\nyou have only one POKéMON.
Who are you?\nHow did you get here?
Oww!\nBeaten!
Blast it… You're dissing TEAM\nROCKET, aren't you?
You broke into TEAM ROCKET's\noperation? What nerve!
Boom!
You're not going to get away with\nthis, brat!
Intruder alert!
I can't do it!
SILPH SCOPE? Humph!\nI don't know where it is.
Why did you come here?
This won't do!
Okay, I'll talk…\nTake the elevator to see my BOSS.
Are you lost, you little mouse?
Why…?
Uh-oh, that ruckus somehow opened\nthe door!
BOSS said you can see ghosts with\nthe SILPH SCOPE.
I surrender!
The TEAM ROCKET HQ has four\nunderground floors.\cThink you can reach the BOSS?
Stop meddling in TEAM ROCKET's\naffairs or else!
Oof!\nTaken down!
SILPH SCOPE?\nOh, that machine the BOSS stole.\cIt's here somewhere.
We got word from upstairs that you\nwere coming!
What?\nI lost? No!
Go ahead and go!\cBut you can't run the elevator\nwithout the LIFT KEY.
So! I must say, I am impressed you\ngot here.\cTEAM ROCKET captures POKéMON from\naround the world.\cThey're important tools for keeping\nour criminal enterprise going.\cI am the leader, GIOVANNI!\cFor your insolence, you will feel a\nworld of pain!
WHAT!\nThis can't be!
I see that you raise POKéMON with\nutmost care.\cA child like you would never\nunderstand what I hope to achieve.\cI shall step aside this time!\cI hope we meet again…
I know you!\nYou ruined our plans at MT. MOON!
Burned again!
Do you have something against TEAM\nROCKET?
How can you not see the beauty of\nour evil?
Ayaya!
BOSS!\nI'm sorry I failed you!
The elevator doesn't work?\nWho has the LIFT KEY?
No!
Oh, no!\nI dropped the LIFT KEY!
It appears to need a key.
Welcome.\cThe PRESIDENT is in the boardroom\non 11F.
めちゃめちゃに　こわされてる\nとうぶん　なおりそうに　ない…
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n1F
Help!\nI'm a SILPH employee.
How did you know\nI was a ROCKET?
I work for both SILPH and TEAM\nROCKET.
It's off-limits here!\nGo home!
You're good.
Can you solve the maze in here?\nIt's not easy, I tell you!
No kids are allowed in here!
Tough!
Diamond-shaped tiles are teleport\nblocks.\cThey're transporters for this\nhigh-tech building.
Hey, kid!\nWhat are you wandering here for?
I goofed!
SILPH CO. will be associated with\nTEAM ROCKET!
Eeek!\nNo! Stop! Help!\cOh, you're not with TEAM ROCKET.\nI'm sorry, I thought…\cWill you forgive me if I teach\nyou the THUNDER WAVE technique?
Oh…\nBut THUNDER WAVE is convenient…
Which POKéMON should I teach\nTHUNDER WAVE?
THUNDER WAVE causes paralysis in\nthe target POKéMON.\cA paralyzed POKéMON may be unable\nto move in battle.\cIt's an ELECTRIC-type move, so it\nwon't work on some POKéMON.
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n2F
I work for SILPH CO.\nWhat am I to do?
[PLAYER]!\nYou and your POKéMON saved us!
Quit messing with us, kid!
I give up!
A hint? You can open doors with\na CARD KEY!
I support TEAM ROCKET more than\nI support SILPH CO.!
You really got me!
Humph…\cTEAM ROCKET said that if I helped\nthem, they'd let me study POKéMON.
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n3F
Sssh!\nCan't you see I'm hiding?
Huh?\nTEAM ROCKET is gone?
TEAM ROCKET has taken control\nof SILPH CO.!
Arrgh!
Fwahahaha!\nMy BOSS has been after this place!
My POKéMON is my loyal servant.
Darn!\nYou weak POKéMON!
The doors are electronically\nlocked.\cIt takes a CARD KEY to open the\ndoors here.
Intruder spotted!
Who are you?
I better tell the BOSS on 11F!
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n4F
TEAM ROCKET is in an uproar over\nsome intruder.\cThat's you, right?
TEAM ROCKET took off!\nYou're our hero! Thank you!
I heard a kid was wandering\naround.
Boom!
It's not smart to pick a fight with\nTEAM ROCKET!
We study POKé BALL technology on\nthis floor.
Dang!\nBlast it!
We worked on the ultimate POKé\nBALL which would catch anything.
Whaaat?\cThere shouldn't be any children\nhere!
Oh, goodness!
You're only on 5F.\nIt's a long way to my BOSS!
Show TEAM ROCKET a little respect!
Cough…\nCough…
Which reminds me.\cKOFFING evolves into WEEZING!
It's a POKéMON REPORT!\cPOKéMON LAB created PORYGON,\nthe first virtual-reality POKéMON.
It's a POKéMON REPORT!\cOver 350 POKéMON techniques have\nbeen confirmed.
It's a POKéMON REPORT!\cSome POKéMON have been confirmed\nto evolve when they are traded.
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n5F
Those thugs that took over our\nbuilding…\cTheir BOSS said he was looking for\nstrong POKéMON.\cI hope our PRESIDENT managed to\navoid trouble…
The ROCKETS came and took over\nthe building!
Well, better get back to work.
Oh dear, oh dear.\nHelp me, please!
We got engaged.\nHeheh!
That man next to me…\nHe's such a coward!
He's so helpless, he needed\nsomeone like me to look after him.
TEAM ROCKET is trying to conquer\nthe world with POKéMON.
TEAM ROCKET ran away, and it's all\nbecause of you!
They must have targeted SILPH for\nour POKéMON products.
Come work for SILPH when you\nget older.
I am one of the four ROCKET\nBROTHERS!
Flame out!
No matter!\nMy brothers will avenge me!
That rotten PRESIDENT!\cServes him right for shipping me\noff to the TIKSI BRANCH!\cThat's why TEAM ROCKET came after\nus, I'm sure of it!
Shoot!
TIKSI BRANCH?\nIt's in Russian no-man's-land!
You dare betray TEAM ROCKET?
You traitor!
If you stand for justice, you\nbetray us bad guys!
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n6F
Oh! Hi! You're not a ROCKET!\nYou came to save us?\rWhy, thank you!\cI want you to have this POKéMON\nfor saving us.
[PLAYER] obtained a LAPRAS from\nthe SILPH employee!
It's a LAPRAS.\nIt's a very intelligent POKéMON.\cWe kept it in our lab, but it will\nbe much better off with you.\cI think you will be a good TRAINER\nfor LAPRAS!\cIt's a good swimmer.\nIt'll give you a lift across water!
TEAM ROCKET's BOSS went to the\nboardroom!\cIs our PRESIDENT okay?\nI'm worried.
あ…　もう　もてないぞ
たすかったよ　ありがと！
TEAM ROCKET was after the MASTER\nBALL, which catches any POKéMON.
We canceled the MASTER BALL\nproject because of TEAM ROCKET.
It would be bad if TEAM ROCKET\ntook over SILPH or our POKéMON.
Wow!\cYou chased off TEAM ROCKET all by\nyourself?
You!\nIt's really dangerous here!\cYou came to save me?\nYou can't!
Thank you so much!
Uh-oh!\nI smell a little mouse!
Lights out!
You won't find my BOSS by just\nscurrying around!
Heheh!\cYou mistook me for a SILPH worker?
I'm done!
Despite your age, you are a\nskilled TRAINER!
I am one of the four ROCKET\nBROTHERS!
Aack!\nBrothers, I lost!
Doesn't matter.\nMy brothers will repay the favor!
A child intruder?\nThat must be you!
Fine!\nI lost!
Go on home before my BOSS gets\nticked off!
[RIVAL]: What kept you, [PLAYER]?
[RIVAL]: Hahaha! I thought you'd\nturn up if I waited here!\cI guess TEAM ROCKET slowed you\ndown! Not that I care!\cI saw you in SAFFRON, so I decided\nto see if you got better!
Oh, man!\nSo, you are ready for BOSS\rROCKET!
[RIVAL]『おまえなあ…\cこんな　うでまえじゃ\nまだまだ…\rいちにんまえ　とは　いえないぜ
Well, [PLAYER]!\nI'm moving on up and ahead!\cBy checking my POKéDEX, I'm\nstarting to see what's strong and\rhow they evolve!\cAm I a genius or what?\cI'm going to the POKéMON LEAGUE to\nboot out the ELITE FOUR.\cI'll become the world's most\npowerful TRAINER!\c[PLAYER], well, good luck to you!\nDon't sweat it!\rSmell ya!
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n7F
I wonder if SILPH is finished…
Thanks for saving us!
That's as far as you'll go!
Not enough grit!
If you don't turn back…\nI'll call for backup!
You're causing us problems!
Huh?\nI lost?
So, what do you think of SILPH\nBUILDING's maze?
I am one of the four ROCKET\nBROTHERS!
Whoo!\nOh, Brothers!
I'll leave you up to my brothers.
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n8F
TEAM ROCKET's BOSS is terribly\ncruel!\cTo him, POKéMON are just tools to\nbe used.\cWhat will happen if that tyrant\ntakes over our company…
You look tired.\nYou should take a quick nap.
Don't give up!
Thank you so much.
Your POKéMON seem to adore you,\nkid!
Ghaaah!
If I had started as a TRAINER at\nyour age…
Your POKéMON have weak points!\nI can nail them!
You hammered me!
Exploiting weak spots does work.\nThink about type advantages.
I am one of the four ROCKET\nBROTHERS!
Warg!\nBrothers, I lost!
My brothers will avenge me!
SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE\n9F
Welcome to 10F!\nSo good of you to join me!
I'm stunned!
Nice try, but the boardroom is up\none more floor.
Enough of your silly games!
No continues left!
Are you satisfied with beating me?\nThen go on home!
Waaaaa!\nI'm scared!
About me crying…\nPlease keep it a secret.

PRESIDENT: Oh, dear boy!\nThank you for saving SILPH.\cI will never forget you saved us in\nour moment of peril.\cI have to thank you in some way.\cBecause I am rich, I can give you\nanything.\cHere, maybe this will do.
PRESIDENT: Oh, dear girl!\nThank you for saving SILPH.\cI will never forget you saved us in\nour moment of peril.\cI have to thank you in some way.\cBecause I am rich, I can give you\nanything.\cHere, maybe this will do.
[PLAYER] obtained a MASTER BALL\nfrom the PRESIDENT!
PRESIDENT: You can't buy that\nanywhere.\cIt's our secret prototype MASTER\nBALL.\cIt will catch any POKéMON without\nfail!\cYou should be quiet about using it,\nthough.
You have no room for this.
SECRETARY: Thank you for rescuing\nall of us.\cWe, from the PRESIDENT down,\nare indebted to you.
Ah, [PLAYER]!\nSo we meet again!\cThe PRESIDENT and I are discussing\na vital business proposition.\cKeep your nose out of grown-up\nmatters…\cOr, experience a world of pain!
Arrgh!!\nI lost again!?
Blast it all!\nYou ruined our plans for SILPH!\cBut, TEAM ROCKET will never fall!\c[PLAYER]! Never forget that all\nPOKéMON exist for TEAM ROCKET!\cI must go, but I shall return!
Stop right there!\nDon't you move!
Don't…\nPlease!
So, you want to see my BOSS?
Halt! Do you have an appointment\nwith my BOSS?
Gaah!\nDemolished!
Watch your step…\nMy BOSS likes his POKéMON tough!
The monitor has POKéMON on it!

You can keep any item you find in\nthe SAFARI ZONE.\cBut, you'll run out of time if you\ntry for all of them at once.
Go to the deepest part of the\nSAFARI ZONE. You will win a prize!
My EEVEE evolved into FLAREON.\cBut, a friend's EEVEE turned into a\nVAPOREON. I wonder why?
The SAFARI ZONE's huge, wouldn't\nyou say?\cFUCHSIA's GYM LEADER, KOGA, \npatrols the grounds every so often.\cThanks to him, we can play here\nknowing that we're safe.
Tossing ROCKS at POKéMON might\nmake them run, but they'll be\reasier to catch.
Using BAIT will make POKéMON more\nlikely to stick around if they get\rbusy eating.
I hiked a lot, but I didn't see any\nPOKéMON I wanted.
Ah! Finally!\cYou're the first person to reach\nthe SECRET HOUSE!\cAlthough I made a campaign\nfor our grand opening,\cI was getting worried that no one\nwould win our campaign prize.\cCongratulations!\nYou have won!
[PLAYER] received HM03\nfrom the attendant!
HM03 is SURF.\cPOKéMON will be able to ferry you\nacross water using it.\cAnd, this HM isn't disposable, so\nyou can use it over and over.\cYou're super lucky for winning this\nfabulous prize!
You don't have room for this\nfabulous prize!
Mew!
Welcome to the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cI am LORELEI of the ELITE FOUR.\cNo one can best me when it comes\nto icy POKéMON.\cFreezing moves are powerful.\cYour POKéMON will be at my mercy\nwhen they are frozen solid.\cHahaha!\nAre you ready?[PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
Welcome to the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cI, LORELEI of the ELITE FOUR,\nhave returned!\cYou know how it goes.\nNo one can best me when it comes\rto icy POKéMON.\cFreezing moves are powerful.\cYour POKéMON will be at my mercy\nwhen they are frozen solid.\cHahaha!\nAre you ready?[PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
…Things shouldn't be this way!
You're better than I thought.\nGo on ahead.\cYou only got a taste of the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE's power.
I am BRUNO of the ELITE FOUR!\cThrough rigorous training, people\nand POKéMON can become stronger\rwithout limit.\cI've lived and trained with my\nfighting POKéMON!\rAnd that will never change!\c[PLAYER]!\cWe will grind you down with our\nsuperior power!\cHoo hah![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]

Why?\nHow could I lose?
My job is done.\nGo face your next challenge.
I am AGATHA of the ELITE FOUR.\cI hear OAK's taken a lot of\ninterest in you, child.\cThat old duff was once tough and\nhandsome.\cBut that was decades ago.\nHe's a shadow of his former self.\cNow he just wants to fiddle with\nhis POKéDEX.\cHe's wrong.\nPOKéMON are for battling!\c[PLAYER]! I'll show you how a real\nTRAINER battles![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
I am AGATHA of the ELITE FOUR.\cYou're the child that OAK's taken\nunder his wing, aren't you?\cThat old duff was once tough and\nhandsome.\cBut that was decades ago.\nHe's a shadow of his former self.\cNow he just wants to fiddle with\nhis POKéDEX.\cHe's wrong.\nPOKéMON are for battling!\c[PLAYER]!

Oh, my!\nYou're something special, child!
You win!\cI see what the old duff sees in\nyou now.\cI have nothing else to say.\nRun along now, child!
Ah! I've heard about you,\n[PLAYER]!\cI lead the ELITE FOUR.\cYou can call me LANCE the dragon\nTRAINER.\cYou know that dragons are\nmythical POKéMON.\cThey're hard to catch and raise,\nbut their powers are superior.\cThey're virtually indestructible.\nThere's no being clever with them.\cWell, are you ready to lose?\cYour LEAGUE challenge ends with\nme, [PLAYER]![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
Ah!\nSo, you've returned, [PLAYER]!\cI lead the ELITE FOUR.\cYou can call me LANCE the dragon\nTRAINER.\cYou know that dragons are\nmythical POKéMON.\cThey're hard to catch and raise,\nbut their powers are superior.\cThey're virtually indestructible.\nThere's no being clever with them.\cWell, are you ready to lose?\cYour LEAGUE challenge ends with\nme, [PLAYER]![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
That's it!\cI hate to admit it, but you are a\nPOKéMON master!
I still can't believe my dragons\nlost to you, [PLAYER].\cYou are now the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION!\c…Or, you would have been, but\nyou have one more challenge left.\cThere is one more TRAINER to face!\nHis name is…\c[RIVAL]!\cHe beat the ELITE FOUR before\nyou.\cHe is the real POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION.
[RIVAL]: Hey, [PLAYER]!\cI was looking forward to seeing\nyou, [PLAYER].\cMy rival should be strong to keep\nme sharp.\cWhile working on my POKéDEX, I\nlooked all over for POKéMON.\cNot only that, I assembled teams\nthat would beat any POKéMON type.\cAnd now…\cI'm the POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION!\c[PLAYER]!\nDo you know what that means?\cI'll tell you.\cI am the most powerful TRAINER in\nthe world!
[RIVAL]: Hey, [PLAYER]!\cYou came back, [PLAYER]!\nHahah, that is so great!\cMy rival should be strong to keep\nme sharp.\cWhile working on my POKéDEX, I\nlooked all over for POKéMON.\cNot only that, I assembled teams\nthat would beat any POKéMON type.\cAnd now…\cI'm the POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION!\c[PLAYER]!\nDo you know what that means?\cI'll tell you.\cI am the most powerful TRAINER in\nthe world!
NO!\nThat can't be!\rYou beat me at my best!\cAfter all that work to become\nthe LEAGUE CHAMP?\cMy reign is over already?\nIt's not fair!
はーはッ！\nかった！　かった！　かった！\c[PLAYER]に　まける　ような\nおれさま　では　なーい！\cま！　ポケモンの\nてんさい　[RIVAL]さま　あいてに\rここまで　よく　がんばった！\cほめて　つかわす！\nはーッ！　はーはッはッ！
Why?\nWhy did I lose?\cI never made any mistakes raising\nmy POKéMON…\cDarn it! You're the new POKéMON\nLEAGUE CHAMPION!\cAlthough I don't like to admit it…
OAK: [PLAYER]!
OAK: So, you've won!\nSincerely, congratulations!\cYou're the new POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION!\cYou've grown up so much since you\nfirst left with [STR_VAR_1] to work\ron the POKéDEX.\c[PLAYER], you have come of age!
OAK: [RIVAL]…\nI'm disappointed in you.\cI came when I heard you'd beaten\nthe ELITE FOUR.\cBut, when I got here, you had\nalready lost!\c[RIVAL], do you understand why\nyou lost?\cYou have forgotten to treat your\nPOKéMON with love and trust.\cWithout them, you will never\nbecome a CHAMP again!
OAK: [PLAYER].\cYou understand that your victory\nwas not just your own doing.\cThe bond you share with your\nPOKéMON is marvelous.\c[PLAYER]!\nCome with me!
OAK: Er-hem!\nCongratulations, [PLAYER]!\cThis floor is the POKéMON HALL OF\nFAME.\cPOKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPIONS are\nhonored for their exploits here.\cTheir POKéMON are also recorded in\nthe HALL OF FAME.\c[PLAYER]!\cYou have worked hard to become\nthe new LEAGUE CHAMPION.\cCongratulations, [PLAYER], you and\nyour POKéMON are HALL OF FAMERS!
This tunnel goes a long way, kid!
Doh!\nYou win!
Watch for ONIX.\nThey appear only occasionally.\cHigh-level ones can put the\nsqueeze on you!
Hmm.\nMaybe I'm lost in here…
Ease up!\nWhat am I doing?\rWhich way is out?
That sleeping POKéMON on ROUTE 12\nforced me to take this detour.
Outsiders like you need to show me\nsome respect!
I give!
You're talented enough to hike!
POKéMON fight!\nReady, go!
Game over!
Oh well, I'll get a ZUBAT as I go!
Eek!\cDon't try anything funny in the\ndark!
It was too dark…
I saw a MACHOP in this tunnel.
I came this far looking for wild\nPOKéMON.
I'm out of POKéMON!
You looked cute and harmless.\nWas I ever wrong!
You have POKéMON!\nLet's start!
You play hard!
Whew!\nI'm all sweaty now.
ROCK TUNNEL\nCERULEAN CITY - LAVENDER TOWN
Do you know how you can avoid\ngetting lost in the mountains?\cYou can bend twigs as trail\nmarkers.
Ohhh!\nI did my best!
I want to go home!
Hahaha!\nCan you beat my power?
Oops!\nOutmuscled!
I go for power because I hate\nthinking.
You have a POKéDEX?\nI want one, too.
Shoot!\nI am so jealous!
When you finish your POKéDEX,\ncan I have it?
Um… Do you know about POKéMON\ncosplay?
Well, that's that.
POKéMON cosplay is dressing up as\nPOKéMON for fun.\cCLEFAIRY is a favorite.
My POKéMON techniques will leave\nyou crying!
I give!\nYou're a better technician!
In mountains, you'll often find\nROCK-type POKéMON.
I don't often come here, but I will\nbattle you.
Oh!\nI lost!
I like tiny POKéMON.\nBig ones are too scary!
Hit me with your best shot!
Fired away!
I'll raise my POKéMON to beat\nyours, kid.
I draw illustrations of POKéMON\nwhen I'm home.
Whew…\nI'm exhausted…
I'm an artist, not a fighter.\nI'll go home to draw.
When you're up on a rocky mountain\nlike this, rockslides are a threat.\cCan you imagine?\nBoulders tumbling down on you?\cThat'd be, like, waaaaaaaaaaah!\nTotal terror!\cYou don't seem to be scared.\nWant to try using ROCK SLIDE?
Oh, so you are scared after all.
Which POKéMON should I teach\nROCK SLIDE?
It might be scary to use it in this\ntunnel…
Hint: Boulders might change the\nflow of water.
DANGER\nFast current!
POKéMON TOWER was erected in the\nmemory of POKéMON that died.
Did you come to pay respects?\cBless your POKéMON-loving heart,\nson.
Did you come to pay respects?\cBless your POKéMON-loving heart,\ngirl.
I came to pray for my dearly\ndeparted CLEFAIRY.\cSniff!\nI'm awash in tears…
My GROWLITHE…\nWhy did you die?
I am a CHANNELER.\cThere are spirits up to mischief.\nI sense them high in the TOWER.
[RIVAL]: Hey, [PLAYER]!\nWhat brings you here?\rIs your POKéMON dead?\cHey! It's alive!\cI can at least make them faint!\nLet's go!
What?\nYou stinker!\cI took it easy on you, too!
[RIVAL]『あーあ…！\nほんとに　くたばっちまったぞ！\rよわいなー！\rもっと　ちゃんと　そだてて　やれよ
How's your POKéDEX coming?\nI just caught a CUBONE!\cI can't find the bigger MAROWAK.\nWhere could they be?\cI bet there aren't any left!\cWell, I better get going.\nI've got a lot to accomplish,\runlike you.\cSmell ya later!
Even we could not identify the\nwayward ghosts.\cA SILPH SCOPE might be able to\nunmask them.
Urrg… Awaa…\nHuhu… Graa…
Hwa!\nI'm saved!
The ghosts can be identified by\nthe SILPH SCOPE.
Kekeke…\nKwaaah!
Hmm?\nWhat am I doing?
Sorry!\nI was possessed!
Be gone!\nMalevolent spirit!
Whew!\nThe spirit left!
The others above…\nThey must have been possessed.
Ghost! No!\nKwaaah!
Where is the ghost?
I must have been dreaming…
Be cursed with me!\nKwaaah!
What!
We can't determine the identity of\nthe ghosts…
Huhuhu…\nBeat me not!
Huh?\nWho? What?
May the departed POKéMON rest in\npeace…
Come, child!\nI have purified this space.\rYou can rest here.
Give…me…\nyour…all…
Gasp!
I was under possession.
You…shall…\njoin…us…
What a nightmare!
I was possessed.
Zombies!
Ha?
I regained my senses.
Urgah…\nUrff…
Whoo!
I fell to evil spirits despite my\ntraining in the mountains…
Entered the purified and protected\nzone.\c[PLAYER]'s POKéMON were fully\nhealed.
Give…me…\nblood…
Groan!
I feel anemic and weak…
Urff…\nKwaah!
Something fell out!
My hair didn't fall out!\nIt was a malevolent spirit!
Ke…ke…ke…\nke…ke…ke!
Keee!
What's going on here?
Be gone…\nIntruders…
The ghost was the restless spirit\nof CUBONE's mother!
The mother's spirit was calmed.\cIt departed to the afterlife…
What do you want?\nWhy are you here?
I give up!
I'm not going to forget this!
This old guy marched right up to\nour HIDEOUT.\cThen, he starts ranting about how\nTEAM ROCKET's abusing POKéMON.\cSo, we're just talking it over as\nadults.
Please!\nNo more!
POKéMON are only good for making\nmoney. Why not use them?\cYou stay out of our business!
You're not saving anyone, kid!
Don't fight us ROCKETS!
You're not getting away with this!
MR. FUJI: Heh?\nYou came to save me?\cThank you. But, I came here of my\nown free will.\cI came to calm the spirit of\nCUBONE's mother.\cI think MAROWAK's spirit has\nfinally left us.\cI must thank you for your kind\nconcern.\cFollow me to my home, POKéMON\nHOUSE, at the foot of this tower.
Can you imagine?\nIf this volcano were to erupt?\cThe explosion would be the end of\nus. How terrifying is that?\cWhile we're terrified, would you\nlike me to teach EXPLOSION?
Yeah, you're right.\nIt is too terrifying.
You're terribly brave!\cWhich POKéMON should I teach\nEXPLOSION?
Using EXPLOSION while on this\nvolcano…\cWhat a terrifying thrill!
こ　この　かざんが\nもし　だいばくはつ　したら\rお　おれら　ひとたまりも\rないなあ　…ブルブル！\cこ　こわい　ついでに\nだいばくはつ　でも　おぼえてみる？
や　やっぱ　こわいもんな\nブルブル
つ　つよきだね！\nじゃあ　どの　ポケモンに　する？
かざんで　だいばくはつを…\nす　すごい　スリル！
Over here.\nWe'll try digging here.\cThat treasure the ADMINS've been\ntalking about should be here.
What the…?\nYou're in the way. Get lost.
Whew, punched through at last.\nLet's go treasure hunting!
Any treasure we find, we haul back\nto the WAREHOUSE, understood?\c…Oh, and what're the passwords?\nAt the ROCKET WAREHOUSE, I mean.
What, you forgot the password?\nThere're actually two.\cThe first one's “GOLDEEN need\nlog.”\cAnd the second one is…
Hey!\nThis snoop's been listening in!
You've been eavesdropping on us,\nhaven't you?
Huh, what?
Why'd you have to win?
Trying to horn in on our treasure?\nDon't bet on it!
Wait!\nBut how?
Develop amnesia conveniently and\nforget everything you heard!
What a setback…\nWe'll have to regroup.\cYou! Don't even think about taking\na step inside here!\cIf you know what's good for you,\ndon't even think about this!
An active volcano is one that's\nerupting, or about to.
Whew… That was hot!\nSweat's erupting from me!
They say there're over 1,500\nactive volcanoes in the world.\cJust thinking about them makes me\nfeel all hot and gooey inside!
Do you know how caves form inside\nvolcanoes?
Atchah!\nYou're shockingly good!
When lava at the surface of magma\nhardens, and the magma inside flows\rout, caverns are left behind.
I've been in training so I can mend\nmy broken heart…\cIt toughened me up physically at\nleast! Hi-yah!
I think I tried to overdo it…
The way you battle, it reminds me\nof the guy who dumped me…
[PLAYER] found a RUBY!
LOSTELLE: Whimper… Sniff…\nOh! Please, help!\cA scary POKéMON appeared there\na little while ago.\cIt kept scaring.\nIt made LOSTELLE scared.\cI'm too scared to move!\nBut I want to go home…
Oh! Here it comes again!\nNo! Go away! It's scaring me!\cWaaaaaaah!\nI want my daddy!
Ohh! That was so scary!\nThank you!\cLOSTELLE came to pick some\nBERRIES.\cYou can have this!
What's your name?\cLOSTELLE's scared, so can I go\nwith you to my daddy's house?\cOkay!\nLet's go home!
Your BERRY POUCH is full.\nI guess you don't want this.
Welcome to the BERRY FOREST\cBe friendly and share BERRIES with\nothers and POKéMON.
Beware of wild, BERRY-loving\nPOKéMON!
LORELEI: Keep your filthy hands\noff the POKéMON in the cave!\cDo as I say, or you'll have me to\nanswer to!
Aww, shut it, lady, and leave\nus be.\cDon't let your glasses get all\nsteamed up!
LORELEI: [PLAYER]?!\nWhat are you doing here?\cNo, we can catch up later.\nRight now, I need your help.\cHelp me kick these poachers out\nbefore they do anything else.\cThey've been catching POKéMON\nhere, then selling them off!\cAre you ready?\nYou take that one, please!
W-what?!\cWho says we can't do what we want\nwith the POKéMON we catch?
We didn't plan on this!
LORELEI: Humph.\nSo despicably weak.\cYou!\nTell me!\cWhere have you taken the captured\nPOKéMON?\cI'm smashing your ring once and\nfor all!
N-no way!\nI'm not telling you that!
LORELEI: If you won't confess,\nwe'll deep-freeze you.\cMy LAPRAS is furious for what\nyou've done to its friends.\cGo, LAPRAS!\nICE BEAM…
Wawaah! Okay!\nI'll talk!\cThe POKéMON are in the ROCKET\nWAREHOUSE on FIVE ISLAND.\cThere! I said it!\nWe'll be going now!\c…But I doubt you'll ever make it\ninto the ROCKET WAREHOUSE!\cHeheheheh!
[PLAYER], thank you.\nBut this is awful…\cI was born and raised here on\nthese islands.\cI had no idea that those horrible\ncriminals were loose here…
There are many POKéMON locked\naway in the pen…
The pen door is unlocked.\nThe POKéMON appear to have fled.
Did you come here knowing it's\nTEAM ROCKET's WAREHOUSE?
What do you think you're doing?!
TEAM ROCKET broke up?\nWhat planet are you from?
Oh, now your POKéMON look strong.\nYou're willing to sell them?\cOh?\nYou wanted to battle?
Oh, but…\nToo much!
We can give you a great price.\nSell us your POKéMON!
I got word about you from the\nothers.\cBut there's no way a kid like you'd\nknow our BOSS GIOVANNI!
Don't…you…dare…laugh…
Don't mess in the doings of adults,\nyou jumped-up pip-squeak!
I don't know or care if what I'm\ndoing is right or wrong…\cI just put my faith in GIOVANNI\nand do as I am told.
I…\nI'm shattered…
You're doing things according to\nyour beliefs and morals.\cI understand now…
I've made it so you can come back\nin through there.\cWhy don't you go get rested and\nrefreshed for what lies ahead?\cThe ADMIN after me outranks me\nthoroughly as a TRAINER.\cYou'd better steel yourself for one\nharsh challenge.
That's quite enough of you \nplaying the hero, kid.\cSpreading lies about how TEAM\nROCKET has disbanded…\cIt's such an obvious attempt to\ncause confusion in our ranks.\cFortunately, we're not so ignorant\nto fall for the lies of a child!\cAnd now, I'll show you how scary\nan angry adult can be!
Urgh…\nYou were too strong…\c…\nTh-that's GIOVANNI's BADGE!\cSo it's true?\nTEAM ROCKET really has disbanded?
We will abandon this WAREHOUSE…\cBut don't think this is over.\nI won't let this be the end.\cI will find GIOVANNI.\nAnd I will resurrect TEAM ROCKET!\rI will…\cUntil then, farewell!
A report with graphs and text is on\nthe PC monitor.\c“The Influence of Magnetic Waves\non POKéMON Evolution”…\c… … … … … …\cIt's too difficult to understand…
I almost managed to sell the\nSAPPHIRE for huge money…\cThen, you just had to come along\nand blow the whole deal apart!\cFufu… Fufufufu…\nThere's no forgiveness for you!
Gah! Darn!\nDarn! Darn!
If I can't sell it, it's worthless!\nGo ahead, take it!
What do you want now?\nGo on, get lost, leave me be.
What, you again?\cYou… You're not GIOVANNI's kid,\nare you?\cNo, that can't be right!\nGIOVANNI's kid has red hair.\cYou don't have any reasons for\nbugging me. Leave me alone!
[PLAYER] found a SAPPHIRE!
Fufu… Fufufufu…\nI guessed right.\cI was right in tailing you!
I knew that there was a SAPPHIRE\nhere, so it belongs to me!\cI'll sell it to TEAM ROCKET for\nserious money.\c…D-don't glare at me like that!\cIf you want it back, why don't you\ngo get it after I sell it?\cI'll even tell you one of the\npasswords to TEAM ROCKET's\rWAREHOUSE.\cThe WAREHOUSE password I know is\n“Yes, nah, CHANSEY.”\cI'm done.\nDon't think badly of me!
I'm curious, how do you raise your\nPOKéMON?
You raise your POKéMON with a\nwhole lot of love!
In the same way your mother raised\nyou full of love, you should raise\ryour POKéMON.
I'm working to preserve the natural\necology of POKéMON here.
Oh, for someone so young, you are\ntremendous!
I'm not saying that you shouldn't\ncatch POKéMON.\cI just want people to raise their\nPOKéMON responsibly.
I caught a BUG POKéMON that lives\nonly around here!
Heheh…\nIsn't my POKéMON awesome?
There's a girl near the BUSH who\nmeasures HERACROSS for TRAINERS.
You know, it just doesn't feel right\nif I don't use BUG POKéMON.
It's okay, losing is a fun part of\nPOKéMON's appeal, too.
By the way, “appeal” is a weird\nword, if you think about it.\cLike, is it like an orange peel?\nOr like a ringing bell?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!\nLook at all the BUG POKéMON!
I got beat while I was still busy\ncelebrating!
I'm going to bring my little brother\nhere next time.
Look, look! There are funny\npatterns on the ground.
Super awesome!
The funny patterns on the ground…\cThey look like the patterns on my\ngrandpa's clothes.
I bet you think I'm just some guy,\ndon't you, eh?
I bet you think I'm weak,\ndon't you, eh?
Ayup, you townies come around all\nso dandy with a hat that flashy…\cHow about giving me that?
Take a deep breath.\nIsn't the air delicious?
If you'd like, I can teach you how\nto breathe properly.
First, exhale.\nBlow everything out.\cWhen you can't exhale anymore,\ninhale the clean air!\cIsn't it refreshing?
I love BUG POKéMON.\nThat's why I'm here all the time.\cAm I the only girl like that?
I lost, but I'm still laughing.\nAm I the only girl like that?
I'm going to keep on collecting\nBUG POKéMON.\cAm I the only girl like that?
This is a good spot.\nI'll pitch my tent here.
Wimped out…
I'm going to observe the night sky\nhere.
Oh, yuck!\nI think a bug stung me!
It wasn't a bug.\nI cut my shin on some grass.
A little cut like that…\nA little spit's enough to cure it!
Have you noticed something odd\nabout these parts?
Have you taken a good look around\nyour feet?
There are places here in PATTERN\nBUSH where grass won't grow.\cWhat could be the cause of such\na phenomenon?
Hello!\cWelcome to TRAINER TOWER where\nTRAINERS gather from all over!
TRAINERS from all over the world\ngather here to battle.\cLet me see…\cRight now, there are TRAINERS only\nup to Floor [STR_VAR_1].
TRAINERS are awaiting your\nchallenge up to the eighth floor.
Would you like to challenge the\nwaiting TRAINERS?
Okay, I'll get the clock started,\nso give it everything you have.\cOn your marks…\cGet set…\cGo!
Please do visit us again!
That was too bad.\cI think you put in a tremendous\neffort in your battling.\cPlease come back and try again!
I hope you give it your best.
When the TRAINERS switch places,\nthe movement can be hectic.\cTo avoid the stampede, we moved\nthe reception counter here.\cI'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Hello…\cI am the owner of this TOWER…\cHow the sky soars above this\nrooftop…\cThe caress of the winds up here…\cIt's all so perfect…\cThe way you battled…\nIt, too, was perfection…
This is for you…
Oh!\nStupendous!\cIt's marvelous how you've come up\nhere so quickly.\cThe fact is, you've done it in\nrecord time…\cI'll have your record posted at\nthe reception counter.
You seem to have taken your sweet\ntime getting here…
What I would like to see is a\nbetter time out of you…\cI'm counting on you.\cUntil then, farewell…
[STR_VAR_1] min. [STR_VAR_2].[STR_VAR_3] sec.
せいせきひょうです
This is a two-on-two battle.\cYou may not battle unless you have\nat least two POKéMON.
Here at TRAINER TOWER, there is an\nevent called TIME ATTACK.\cYou will be timed on how quickly\nyou can get from the reception\rcounter to the OWNER on the roof.\cThe best times will be recorded on\nthe Time Board.\cTry competing with friends to see\nwho can beat it the fastest.\cYou will not earn any EXP. Points\nor money by beating TRAINERS here.
Thank you for competing!
I'm here to see how good I am.\cI wonder what kinds of TRAINERS\nare waiting for me?\cIt's nerve-racking!
Gasp, gasp…\nGasp…\cNever mind battling! These stairs…\nThey're tougher than any battle…
Aiyeeeeeh!\cI thought this was an ancient ruin.\nBut it's teeming with ghosts!
Aiyeeeeeh!\nMercy!
I'm trying to get out of here, but\nI always end up at the same spot.\cMaybe the number of boulders is\na hint…
I think there is a mysterious power\nat work in this cave.
If you don't go into the right\ntunnel, you won't get ahead.
Earlier, a lady went into the caves\nahead.
W-what do you intend to do with\nme?
Oh… I was afraid that you meant to\nharm me.
I am so glad that you happened\nhere.\cI grew rather bored of walking,\nand I am feeling fatigued.\cMay I ask you to take me home\nfrom here?
Hey, there!\nHow's it going?\cWhat am I doing here, you ask?\nWhy, I'm prospecting for gold!\cWhen I strike it rich, I'm buying\na house in KANTO.
Hey, there! How's it going?\nDid you hear? I've struck gold!\cYou remembered that I was\nprospecting, didn't you?\cYou can't begin to imagine just\nhow happy I am.\cSo, I'll show you!\nThis is for you!

My favorite part of bathing comes\nup right after this.\cI enjoy a bowl of chowder to\nwarm me from the inside, too!
The water is perfectly warm.\nIt feels exquisite…\c[PLAYER] and the POKéMON were\nfully refreshed!
Soaking in a hot spring pool is\ntherapeutic, people say.
Have a look at my face.\nSee how smooth my skin is?\cThe hot spring's water keeps my\nskin younger than my age.
After an honest day of training,\nnothing beats a relaxing soak in\rthe hot spring pool.\cBRUNO, who's a senior ahead of me,\nvisits the SPA on occasion.\cHe comes to rehab injuries, both\nhis own and his POKéMON's.
Hot springs go hand-in-hand with\nvolcanoes.\cThe EMBER SPA here, well,\nI made it years ago.\cI hewed the pool right out of a\ngigantic boulder by hand.\cI was using this at the time.\nI suppose I can part with it.
That shatters boulders as if they\nwere made of crackers.

There! Now tell me, that was\neducational, was it not?\cAnd here, take this, too.
If there's something you don't\nunderstand, watch that.\cIt will teach you about the basics\nof being a POKéMON TRAINER.
Well, now, I've had my coffee, and\nthat's what I need to get going!\cBut I made it too strong.\nIt gave me a headache…\cIncidentally, are you filling your\nPOKéDEX?\cAt first, focus on weakening the\nPOKéMON before trying to catch it.
Well, now, I've had my coffee, and\nthat's what I need to get going!\cBut I made it too strong.\nIt gave me a headache…\cIncidentally, is my old TEACHY TV\nhelping you?
Wahaha!\nIt's my grandson on the show!\cSince he's the one doing the\nteaching, you're bound to learn.

FIVE ISLAND\nChrono Island: Where Time Goes
Oh, this stinks. I wanted to play in\nthe MEADOW.\cBut they put up a weird building\non it, so I can't play there.
It's been getting busier around\nthese parts lately.\cI haven't been catching many good\nfish lately, either.
Not many people come out here.\cIf I train here, I'm convinced that\nI'll get stronger and stronger.\cYep, stronger and stronger…\cHow would you like to learn a move\nlike that? It's SWORDS DANCE.
Well, that's fine, too.
All right, pick which POKéMON\nI should teach it to.
If only we could keep getting\nstronger and stronger, eh?
SEVEN ISLAND\nQuest Island of Infinity
These islands are called the SEVII\nISLANDS because there are seven.\c…Or at least that's what the young\npeople believe.\cThe truth is, these islands are so\nnamed because they are said to\rhave been made in seven days.
This island has been left virtually\nuntouched in its natural state.\cIt could be a little difficult to\nhike around because of that.
SIX ISLAND\nFortune Island of Aged Wisdom
Keep going this way and you'll get\nto the WATER PATH.\cStay on that and you'll get to\nthe RUIN VALLEY.
When you're this far away from the\ncity, the sky at night is fantastic.
Hi!\nI work at a POKéMON MART.\cIt's part of a convenient chain\nselling all sorts of items.\cPlease, visit us in VIRIDIAN CITY.\cI know, I'll give you a sample.\nHere you go!
Please come see us if you need\nPOKé BALLS for catching POKéMON.

Hey!\nI saw you in VIRIDIAN FOREST!
You beat me again!
There are other kinds of POKéMON\nthan the ones you find in forests.
Hi!\nI like shorts!\cThey're delightfully comfy and\neasy to wear!
I don't believe it!
Are you using a POKéMON CENTER's\nPC for storing your POKéMON?\cEach BOX can hold up to\n30 POKéMON.
Excuse me!\nYou looked at me, didn't you?
You're mean!
You shouldn't be staring if you\ndon't want to battle!
Are you a TRAINER?\nLet's get with it right away!
If I had new POKéMON, I would've\nwon!
If a POKéMON BOX on the PC gets\nfull, just switch to another BOX.
That look you gave me…\nIt's so intriguing!
Be nice!
You can avoid battles by not\nletting TRAINERS see you.
Hey! You're not wearing shorts!\nWhat's wrong with you?
Lost!\nLost! Lost!
I always wear shorts, even in\nwinter. That's my policy.
I'll battle you with the POKéMON\nI just caught.
Done like dinner!
Trained POKéMON are stronger than\nthe wild ones.
Eek!\nDid you touch me?
That's it?

A punch of roaring ferocity!\cPacked with destructive power!\cWhen the chips are down,\nMEGA PUNCH is the ultimate attack!\rYou agree, yes?\cNow!\nLet me teach it to your POKéMON!
You'll be back when you understand\nthe worth of MEGA PUNCH.
Fine!\nWhich POKéMON will learn it?
Now, we are comrades in the way of\npunching!\cYou should go before you're seen\nby the misguided fool who trains\ronly his silly kicking over there.
A kick of brutal ferocity!\cPacked with destructive power!\cWhen you get right down to it,\nMEGA KICK is the ultimate attack!\rDon't you agree?\cOkay!\nI'll teach it to your POKéMON!
You'll come crawling back when you\nrealize the value of MEGA KICK.
All right!\nWhich POKéMON wants to learn it?
Now, we are soul mates in the way\nof kicking!\cYou should run before you're seen\nby the deluded nitwit who trains\ronly simple punching over there.
Oh, wow, that's the BOULDERBADGE!\nYou got it from BROCK, didn't you?\cBROCK is cool. He's not just tough.\nPeople like and respect him.\cI want to become a GYM LEADER\nlike him.

Excuse me!\nThis is a private conversation!
Ugh!\nI hate losing.
Whisper…\nWhisper…
There aren't many bugs out here.
No!\nYou're kidding!
I like bugs, so I'm going back to\nVIRIDIAN FOREST.
Huh?\nYou want to talk to me?
This stinks…\nI couldn't beat your challenge…
I should bring more POKéMON with\nme. I'll feel safer that way.
Me?\nWell, okay. I'll play!
Things just didn't work…
I want to get stronger.\nWhat's your secret?
I've never seen you around.\nAre you good?
You're too good!
Are my POKéMON weak?\nOr, am I just bad?\rWhich do you think?

Ow!\nMeltdown!
I am better at school than this!
All right!\nLet's play a game!
Drat!\nCame up short!
Things didn't work today.
You should be informed.\nYou need strategy to win at this!
It's not logical!
Go with GRIMER first…and…\n…and…then…
I like NIDORAN, so I collect them!
Why?\nWhy??
When POKéMON grow up, they get\nugly! They shouldn't evolve.
School is fun, but so are POKéMON.
You made it clear to me that\nI should stick with school.
I was planning on getting some\nfresh air for a change, but…\cWe're stuck here because of the\ngates at SAFFRON.
MEOWTH is so cute, meow, meow,\nmeow!
Meeeeyow!
I think PIDGEY and RATTATA are\ncute, too!
We must look silly standing here\nlike this.
Look what you did to my poor, cute\nPOKéMON!
SAFFRON's gatekeeper won't let us\ngo through.\cI know he's doing his job, but I\nthink he's mean.
I'm a rambling, gaming dude!
Missed the big chance!
Playing games and POKéMON are like\neating peanuts! I just can't stop!
What's a cute, round, and fluffy\nPOKéMON?
Stop!\cDon't be so mean to my CLEFAIRY!
I read that CLEFAIRY evolves when\nit's exposed to a MOON STONE.\cI read that in a POKéMON JOURNAL.\nI wonder if it's true?

ELI: Twin power is fantastic.\nDid you know?
ELI: But…\nWe used our twin power…
ELI: I caught my POKéMON with\nANNE!
ELI: We can't battle if you don't\nhave two POKéMON.
ANNE: We'll shock you with our twin\npower!
ANNE: Our twin power…
ANNE: I'm raising POKéMON with\nELI.
ANNE: Hi, hi! Let's battle!\nBut bring two POKéMON.
My bike's acting up, man.
Aww, man.\nI'm not into this.
I got grass caught up in my\nspokes, man.
Clear the way, or I'll run you\ndown!
You for real, kid?
Don't think you're all special and\nall just because of this.
You have POKéMON with you!\nYou're mine!
You deceived me…
The tunnel coming up is pitch-black\ninside.\cYou'll need FLASH to get through\nthere.
Who's that walking there with those\ngood-looking POKéMON?

Keep walking!
I'm taking the ROCK TUNNEL to\ngo to LAVENDER…
Can't measure up…
Are you off to ROCK TUNNEL, too?
Don't you dare patronize me!
No!\nYou're too much.
You're obviously talented.\nGood luck to you!
Bwahaha!\nGreat! I was bored, eh!
Keep it coming, eh!\cOh wait.\nI'm out of POKéMON!
You sure had guts standing up to\nme there, eh?
Hahaha!\nAren't you a little toughie!
What's that?
Hahaha!\nKids should be tough!
I got up early every day to raise\nmy POKéMON from cocoons!
WHAT?\cWhat a total waste of time!
I have to collect more than bugs\nto get stronger…
Hahahaha!\nBring it on!
Hahahaha!\nYou beat me fair!
Hahahaha!\nUs hearty guys always laugh!
Go, my super BUG POKéMON!
My bugs…

Hi, kid!\nWant to see my POKéMON?
Oh, no!\nMy POKéMON!
I don't like you.\nI don't like anyone better than me!
I've been out at a POKéMON GYM\na few times.\c…But I always lose.
Ohh!\nAfter all my training!
I noticed some POKéMANIACS\nprowling around.\cCan you imagine? Them?\nUp here in the mountains?
Ah!\nThis mountain air is delicious!
That cleared my head!
I feel bloated on mountain air!
I'm feeling a bit faint.\nI haven't hiked in some time.
I'm too tired.\nI wasn't up for it.
The POKéMON here in the mountains\nare so chunky…\cI wish there were pink POKéMON\nwith a floral pattern!

Huh?\nThat's not right!
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.
Careful!\nI'm laying down some cables!
That was electric!
Spread the word to save energy!
I just became a TRAINER.\nBut, I think I can win.
My POKéMON couldn't win…\nHaven't they grown enough?
What now?\nLeave me alone!
Fwahaha!\nI have never lost!
My first loss!
You were just lucky, that's all.
I have never won before…
I saw this coming…
I was unlucky, as always.
I'm the best in my class.\nI train every morning.
Darn!\nMy POKéMON need to be stronger!
There's a fat POKéMON that comes\ndown from the mountains.\cI bet it'd be strong if you can\ncatch it.
Watch out for live wires!
Whoa!\nYou spark plug!
Well, better get back to work.
I raised my POKéMON carefully.\nThey should be ready by now!
Bye-bye!\nThank you, and good-bye!

I'm searching for a MOON STONE.\nHave you found one?
Oww!
I could have made my POKéMON\nevolve with a MOON STONE.\cI would have won then, I bet.
Electricity is my specialty.\cI don't know a thing about POKéMON\nof the sea, though.

It's not easy…
It's all right.\nLosing doesn't bug me anymore.

Ohh!\nI lost!
I want to become a good TRAINER.\nI'll train hard, just watch.
Wow!\nYour BADGES are too cool!
Not enough!
You got those BADGES from GYM\nLEADERS. I know!
My cute POKéMON wish to make your\nacquaintance.
Good going!\nYou totally won!
You have to make POKéMON battle\nto toughen them up.
I found CARBOS in a cave once\nwhile I was spelunking.
Oh, too bad!\nI just messed up!
CARBOS boosted the SPEED of my\nPOKéMON.
I'm not going to lose.\nNot when the wind's blowing my way!
The wind turned!
I'm beat.\nI guess I'll FLY home.
Sure, I'll play with you, sweetie.
Oh!\nYou little beast!
I wonder which is stronger, male or\nfemale POKéMON?
Do you want to battle some\nPOKéMON with me?
It's over already?
I don't know anything about\nPOKéMON actually.\cThe ones I use… I picked them\nfor their looks!
What're you lookin' at?

You need to use TMs to teach good\nmoves to POKéMON.
Not good enough quite yet.
You have some HMs, right? POKéMON\ncan't forget those moves easily.
My bird POKéMON should be ready\nfor battle.
Not ready yet!
My bird POKéMON need to learn\nbetter moves.
They have TMs on sale at the\nCELADON DEPT. STORE.\cTMs aren't really rare, but not\nmany people have HMs.
Aww, bummer!
Try teaching POKéMON a move that's\nthe same type as it.\cThat apparently boosts the power\nof the move.
Have you taught your bird POKéMON\nhow to FLY?\cYou'll be able to soar with it into\nthe sky!
Shot down in flames!
Bird POKéMON are my one true love.\nI don't want to raise anything else.
Have you heard the legend of the\nwinged mirages?
Why?\nWhy'd I lose?
Well, the winged mirages are the\nlegendary bird POKéMON.\cThere are three of them: ARTICUNO,\nZAPDOS, and MOLTRES.
I'm not into it, but okay.\nLet's go!
I knew it!
Winning, losing… It's insignificant\nunder this huge sky.
C'mon, c'mon.\nLet's go, let's go, let's go!

What, what, what?\nWhat do you want still?
I need to burn some time.\nShut up and battle.

JAN: Eeeeh!\nNo fair!
JAN: KIRI, don't cry!\nWe'll just try harder next time.
JAN: You want to battle?\nYou don't have enough POKéMON.
I just got some POKéMON in trades.\nCan I try them out on you?
Not good enough!
You can't change the nickname of\nany POKéMON you get in a trade.\cOnly the Original TRAINER can get\nthe nickname changed.
You look gentle, so I think I can\nbeat you.\cI'll give it a go!
No, wrong!
I'm afraid of BIKERS. They look so\nugly and mean!
When I whistle, I can summon bird\nPOKéMON.
Ow!\nThat's tragic!
Maybe I'm not cut out for battles.\nI'm not the right type, I guess.
Hmm? My birds are shivering!\nYou're good, aren't you?
Just as I thought!
This is so obvious, you should know\nthis, but…\cMoves like EARTHQUAKE and FISSURE\nhave no effect on bird POKéMON.
Oh, you're a little cutie!\nSo like a darling POKéMON!
You looked so cute, too!
I forgive you.\nI can take it.\rI'm a big girl now.
I raise POKéMON for protection\nbecause I live alone.
POKéMON isn't about winning or\nlosing for me.
I love having my POKéMON greet me\nwhen I get home.\cIt's so reassuring.

The sea cleanses my body and soul!
Ayah!
The sea is great and all, but I\nlike the mountains, too.
おれだって　たまには\nおよぎに　くるぜ！
ぐわわ！
うきやすそう　だと？\nうるせー　おおきな　おせわだッ！
I caught my POKéMON at sea.
Diver!!\nDown!!
Where'd you catch your POKéMON?
Right now, I'm in a triathlon meet.
Pant…\nPant… Pant…
I'm beat! But, I still have the\nbike race and marathon left!
Ahh!\nFeel the sun and the wind!
Yow!\nI lost!
I'm sunburnt to a crisp!
Hey, don't scare away the fish!
Sorry! I'm just so frustrated from\nnot catching anything.
Sheesh, I haven't caught a thing.\nCould this place actually be a\rgiant pool or something?
Keep me company till I get a hit.
That burned some time.
Oh wait!\nI got a bite! Yeah!
LIL: Huh? A battle?\nIAN, can't you do it alone?
LIL: Oh, see?\nWe lost. Happy now?
LIL: I'm tired.\nCan't we go home already?
LIL: Huh? A battle?\nI can't be bothered to do it alone.\rBring two POKéMON, won't you?
IAN: My sis doesn't get enough\nexercise, so I made her come.
IAN: Awww, Sis!\nGet it together!
IAN: Come on, Sis!\cYou're not going to lose weight\nlike this!
IAN: We want a two-on-two battle.\nSo can you bring two POKéMON?
[RIVAL]: Hey! [PLAYER]!\cYou're off to the POKéMON LEAGUE?\nForget about it!\cYou probably don't have any\nBADGES, do you?\cThe guard won't let you through\nwithout them.\cBy the way, did your POKéMON get\nany stronger?
Awww!\nYou just lucked out!
I heard the POKéMON LEAGUE is\ncrawling with tough TRAINERS.\cI have to figure out how to get\npast them.\cYou should quit dawdling and get a\nmove on!
[RIVAL]『なんだ？\nポケモン　２ひきも\rもってるの　なぜか　だって？\cおまえも\nつかまえれば　いい　じゃん！
[RIVAL]: What? [PLAYER]!\nWhat a surprise to see you here!\cSo you're going to the POKéMON\nLEAGUE?\cYou collected all the BADGES, too?\nThat's cool!\cThen I'll whip you, [PLAYER], as a\nwarm-up for the POKéMON LEAGUE!\cCome on!
What!?\cI was just careless, you!
That loosened me up.\nI'm ready for the POKéMON LEAGUE!\c[PLAYER], you need more practice.\cBut hey, you know that!\nI'm out of here. Smell ya!
[RIVAL]『ひゃははッ　[PLAYER]ー！\nそれで　がんばってるのかよ！\rおれの　さいのうに　くらべりゃ\r[PLAYER]は　まだまだ　だな！\cもっと　れんしゅう　こいよ！\nあははーッ！
POKéMON LEAGUE\nFront Gate
VICTORY ROAD GATE -\nPOKéMON LEAGUE
Congratulations! You beat our\nfive contest TRAINERS!\cYou just earned a fabulous prize!
[PLAYER] received a NUGGET\nfrom the mystery TRAINER!
You don't have any room!
By the way, how would you like to\njoin TEAM ROCKET?\cWe're a group of professional\ncriminals specializing in POKéMON!\cWant to join?\cAre you sure?\cCome on, join us!\cI'm telling you to join!\c…Okay, you need convincing!\cI'll make you an offer you can't\nrefuse!
Arrgh!\nYou are good!
With your ability, you'd become\na top leader in TEAM ROCKET.\cCome on, think of the opportunity!\nDon't let this chance go to waste.
I saw your feat from the grass!
I thought not!
I hid because the people on the\nbridge frightened me.
Okay! I'm No. 5!\nI'll stomp you!
Whoa!\nToo much!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I'm No. 4!\nGetting tired?
I lost, too!
I did my best, so I've no regrets!
Here's No. 3!\nI won't be easy!
Ow!\nStomped flat!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I'm second!\nNow it's serious!
How could I lose?
I did my best. I have no regrets!
People call this the NUGGET\nBRIDGE!\cBeat us five TRAINERS and win\na fabulous prize!\cThink you got what it takes?
Whoo!\nGood stuff!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
Local TRAINERS come here to\npractice.
You're decent.
All POKéMON have weaknesses.\nEven the strongest ones.\cThat's why it's best to raise\nPOKéMON of different types.
Dad took me to a great party on\nthe S.S. ANNE at VERMILION CITY.
I'm not mad!
On the S.S. ANNE, I saw TRAINERS\nfrom around the world.
I'm a cool guy.\nI've got a girlfriend!
Aww, darn…
Oh, well.\nMy girlfriend will cheer me up.
Hi!\nMy boyfriend is cool!
My conditioning isn't the best…
I wish my boyfriend was as good\nas you.
I had this feeling…\nI knew I had to battle you!
I knew I'd lose, too!
If your POKéMON gets confused,\nswitch it out.\cThat's a good tactic.
My friend has many cute POKéMON.\nI'm so jealous!
I'm not so jealous!
You came from MT. MOON?\nMay I have a CLEFAIRY?
I just got down from MT. MOON,\nbut I've still got gas in the tank!
You worked hard!
Drat!\nA ZUBAT bit me back in that cave.
I'm off to see a POKéMANIAC's\ncollection at the cape.
You done got me, and real good,\ntoo!
The POKéMANIAC sure lives up to\nhis name.\cHis collection includes many rare\nspecies of POKéMON.
You're going to see BILL?\nFirst, we battle!
You're something.
The trail below is a shortcut to\nCERULEAN CITY.
SEA COTTAGE\nBILL lives here!
This cape is a famous date spot.\cMISTY, the GYM LEADER, has high\nhopes about this place.
Hello, are you here alone?\cIf you're out at CERULEAN's cape…\nWell, it should be as a couple.
The weather's gorgeous!\nPerfect for a battle!
Aiyeeeeh!
Please don't splash my face!\nYou'll ruin the makeup.
I'm beginning to get a sunburn…
Oh, you're so awful.
I like that cap you have.\nMaybe I should wear one, too…
Seen from here, MT. EMBER towers\ninto the sky.
Well, aren't you tough?
The sky is immense around these\nparts.
I took a break from swimming,\nonly to have you challenge me?
Hey, what the…\nYou're good, you!
Instead of using SURF all the time,\nyou should swim some.
Wait! Wait a second!\nI think I've hooked a big one!
I've lost it all again…
Not only did I lose, the big one\ngot away from me, too!
Could you help me out with my\ntraining?
You were a cut above me.
It's clear that you're skilled.\nI like you!
There isn't a day in which we don't\ntrain!
I'm such a fool!
I'll train even harder from now on!
Every morning, before breakfast,\nI swim around this island.
Gasp…\nGasp…
I lost because I'm pooped from all\nthe running I did…
Dress appropriately for battle!\nLose that frivolous outfit!
Why me?!
Even martial artists are becoming\nfashion conscious these days…
You know, everything tastes great\nwhen you're out in the wild.
Awww, blown!
The water in volcanic regions is\ndelicious.
My lunch filled us up, so will you\nbattle us for some exercise?
That made me all sweaty.
What should I do?\nI feel famished again.
KIA: My big brother and I make\nan awesome combination!
KIA: Huh?!\nI can't believe it!
KIA: How could there be anyone\nbetter than my big brother?
KIA: If you want to battle with\nus, you have to bring at least two\rPOKéMON with you.
MIK: Together with KIA, I'm afraid\nof nothing!
MIK: Whoa!\nThat's too much!
MIK: How could my combination\nwith KIA fail?
MIK: Hey, do you want to battle\nwith us two?\cBring two or more POKéMON with\nyou, then.
This is KINDLE ROAD.\cGo straight for MT. EMBER.
Light the Fire in Your Heart!\nEMBER SPA
Lying back, rocked by the waves…\nIt's exquisite.
I lost…\nIt feels awful.
The sea is pleasantly warm in these\nparts.
Good things get washed up by the\nocean current onto this beach.\cThat's why I often come here for\nsome beachcombing.
The salty tang of the sea…\nIt tickles my heart.
…Sniff, sniff…\nSomething smells unpleasant…
Perhaps that reek is your sweaty\nPOKéMON's body odor…
Where are you off to in such\na hurry?
You're raising some wonderful\nPOKéMON.
If you keep going this way, you'll\neventually reach BERRY FOREST.
My mommy said that I can't swim\nwithout my float ring.
Waaah!\nWaaah!
This year, I'm going to finally\nlearn how to swim!
Yay, yay!\nPOKéMON!
What happens now?
Did I just win?\nOr did I lose?
Oh, no, don't come here!\nPlease, stay away from me!
Okay, you've won!\nNow will you please go away?
A POKéMON bit through my \nswimsuit.\cI can't get out of the water!
JOY: We'll teach you what our\nfavorite POKéMON is!
JOY: Ohh…\nMEG!
JOY: Wasn't that fun?\nI hope we can battle again!
JOY: I really want to battle with\nMEG.\cOne POKéMON isn't enough.
MEG: We'll show you our favorite\nPOKéMON.
MEG: Ohh…\nJOY!
MEG: JOY, wasn't that fun?
MEG: I want to battle together\nwith JOY.\cOne POKéMON isn't enough.
BERRY FOREST AHEAD
BOND BRIDGE\nPlease be quiet when crossing.\cBERRY FOREST AHEAD
We're the KANTO RIDER FEDERATION!\nVroom! Vavavavooom! Vroom!\cMy bike's wimpy, so I have to\nmake exhaust noises myself!
Hey, hey, lady!\nFork over some spending money!
Aiyeeh!\cWh-who are you?!\nI… I'll call the police!
Those BIKERS…\nAre they gone?\cOh, thank goodness!\nThey certainly had me terrified!
Those BIKERS ran off, and\nLOSTELLE was found safe.\cEverything turned out for the best!
With these hands, I will create\nmy victory!
The shame of this…\nI'm red-faced…
Uh-oh, my paint tubes have\nscattered everywhere!
Excuse me!\nI'm trying to paint.\rPlease keep out of my sight!
This loss…\nI feel like I'm whiting out…
GILLIAN?\nPlease tilt your head slightly…\rThere! That's the look I want!
Hmm…\nThe angle, it is not quite there…
Oh…\nMy feelings, they are blue…
The sky and the sea…\nThey are so fickle.\cTheir changing expressions make\nthem difficult to capture.
I am visiting my friend's retreat,\nif you must know.
Oh, my, so strong.
I find it pleasurable to leisurely\nbattle in the gentle sea breeze.
I'm thinking of having a pool\nmade specially for POKéMON.
Oh, my goodness gracious!
A pool would be nice, but I must\nsay, a sun-room may be sublime.
I'm a good runner.\nI'm really fast!
Oops!\nI rushed things!
When I run with the wind, it feels\nlike I could fly!
I say, this marine life here at\nthis resort agrees with me.
That's a shocker!\nYou must be joking.
Getting so serious over this…\nHow nonsensical.
SELPHY: Thank you.\cYou may go now.
SELPHY'S HOUSE
You travel all over the place,\ndon't you?\cYou're not driving your POKéMON\ntoo harshly, are you?\cLet me take a look.\n… … …   … … …
Ah, hmm…\nI see, I see…
Oh, impressive.\nYou treat your POKéMON right.\cI think you can be entrusted with\nthis.\cPlease, I'd like you to have this.
[PLAYER] received an EGG\nfrom the man!
…Unfortunately, you don't have\nspace for this in your party.\cYou'd better come back for it\nanother time.
やあ\nタマゴを　もらいに\rきて　くれたんだね
I received that EGG while I was\ntraveling.\cI'm glad I met someone like you.
Oh, hello.\nThat's a cute [STR_VAR_2].\cSeeing it reminds me of a sweet \nlittle girl I met while traveling.\cShe was gently grooming POKéMON…\nShe was a little angel.\cThat little girl's name…\nI think it was DAISY.
This is an excellent environment\nfor raising POKéMON.
Your POKéMON are growing up\nadmirably well!
You know, I think you have the\ntalent to be a good BREEDER.
とびらを　あけるには\nパスワードが　２つ　いるようだ
[PLAYER] entered a password.\c“GOLDEEN need log.”\c… …  … …  … …\cAnother password is needed to\nopen the door…
[PLAYER] entered two passwords.\c“GOLDEEN need log.”\n“Yes, nah, CHANSEY.”\c… …  … …  … …\cThe WAREHOUSE's door opened!
The WAREHOUSE's door is already\nopen.
This area's strictly off-limits!\nOut, out!
Is this for real?
You don't have any business here!\nGo home!
There's nothing past here except\nour WAREHOUSE.\cSo what brings you here?
That wasn't supposed to happen…
You're wanting to know what's inside\nthis WAREHOUSE?\cIt's better you didn't know.\nFor your own sake, I mean.
You'd be wasting time even if you\nwere to get by me.
Oh, that makes me furious!
You won't be able to get in without\nthe passwords anyway.
I'm the eldest of the BIRD\nBROTHERS.\cThe best thing about birds…\nIt has to be the beak.
Oh, so sharp!
You can fly to FOUR ISLAND from\nhere.
I'm the middle kid of the BIRD\nBROTHERS.\cThe best thing about birds…\nIt has to be the wings.
Flap, flap!
There was a really somber guy\nover that way.
I'm the youngest of the BIRD\nBROTHERS.\cThe best thing about birds…\nIt has to be the down.
Down is so comfy…\nIt makes me drowsy…
It fills me with happiness when\nbird POKéMON beg playfully…
Scrub, scrub…
Hello…\nYour POKéMON look healthy…
This is where I buried my ONIX…\nIt was named TECTONIX…
“Here lies TECTONIX” is engraved\non a boulder.\cThere is a LEMONADE placed as an\noffering in front of the grave.
Would you like to leave another\nLEMONADE as an offering?
[PLAYER] placed a can of LEMONADE\nin front of the grave.
Th-thank you…\cThat was my TECTONIX's favorite\ndrink…\cI don't even know you, but your\nact of kindness…\cIt's uplifted me a little.\cCan you please take this as my\nthanks?
Please be good to your POKéMON,\ntoo.
If you don't have room for it,\nI'll hold it for you till next time.
Oh, it's you from that time…\cI still have that thing I wanted\nyou to have as my thanks.
Scrub, scrub…\c… … …\nTECTONIX…
Boulders and rocks are neatly piled\nup as a cairn.\c“Here lies TECTONIX” is engraved\non a boulder.
There're no rare POKéMON around\nthese parts! Not a one!\cThat burns me up, man.\nI'll take it out on you!
…Huh?
So listen, you haven't seen any\nrare POKéMON, have you?
I'm having no luck at all.\nA battle'd be a change of pace!
Nope, no luck at all…
I can't very well go home without\ncatching something, though.
Gasp… Gasp…\cI swam here from SIX ISLE PORT\nin one go.
Gasp…\nGasp…
I'm only at the halfway point…\nI'm beat…
It's not so easy sending POKéMON\nout while swimming, you know?
I didn't lose to you at swimming.\nThis doesn't bother me.
Are you headed for the island up\npast here?\cI didn't see anything interesting\nthere.
AVA: Let's have a two-on-two\nmarine battle!
AVA: Oh, you're amazing!\nEven better, you're on your own!
AVA: You know, I do prefer the\nsea over any pool.
AVA: You're challenging us to\na battle?\cYou'll need at least two POKéMON\nif you want to do that.
GEB: Big Sister, help!\nPlease battle with me!
GEB: Wow, Big Sister, this person's\nreally good!
GEB: I'm hanging onto my sister\nbecause I can't touch the bottom.
GEB: Please battle against me and\nmy sister!\c…Oh, you don't have two POKéMON?
…Huh?\cI was envisioning my house, but\nthis is where I TELEPORT?
Big boo-boo!
I am so scatterbrained!\cI need to focus so I can TELEPORT\nproperly to my house!
GREEN PATH\nPATTERN BUSH AHEAD
GREEN PATH\nThink Green, Keep Nature Clean!
I let a pleasant breeze lead me\nall the way here.
Giggle… You're so cute when you're\ndetermined.
I want to go to the woods over\nthere, but…\cThere are lots of BUG POKéMON.\nThey scare me a little.
I'm practicing in secret so no one\ncan see me.
Nobody saw me losing, right?
As a performer, I don't want people\nto know about the effort I put in.
What, you're suggesting that you're\nsick of seeing SWIMMERS like me?\cAww, don't be hatin'!
Oh, no, no, no.
I couldn't lift the stigma of being\na SWIMMER…
My boyfriend's always busy, so I\ncome swimming by myself.
Awww, I knew this would happen!
When I can't be with my boyfriend,\nI spend time with the POKéMON he\rgave me.
Tell me, where are the mountains\naround these parts?
I lost my way while I was busy\nbattling!
Aren't there any mountains around\nthese parts?
MIU: Hello, POKéMON!\nIt's time to play!
MIU: Oh, no!\nMommy!
MIU: It makes me all sad inside\nwhen we lose…
MIU: MIA and I are TWINS.\nWe want to battle together.
MIA: Hello, POKéMON!\nIt's time to battle!
MIA: You're mean!\nYou're bad for winning!
MIA: Ohh…\nI'm sorry, my POKéMON…
MIA: Oh, you only have one\nPOKéMON?\cDon't you feel lonesome?
Wanted!\nThe Ultimate Horn!
WATER PATH\nLeads to RUIN VALLEY
I can't figure out how I'm supposed\nto get inside.
Let me tell you, I found this\nplace.\cDon't look so envious, will you?
The door doesn't budge at all.\nCheck it more thoroughly?
[PLAYER] left the door alone.
On closer inspection, there are\nseveral dots on the door…
The door is open.
There appear to be many secrets\nstill unsolved in this world.
Hmm…
I suggest to you that you, too,\ngive a thought to the secrets and\rmysteries of our world once a day.
I'm curious, what compelled you to\ncome here?
It's been so long since I battled,\nmy instincts are off.
There are several ruins on the\nSEVII ISLANDS.\cThe majority of them date back\na long way.
It's been said that there are\nmysterious stones on this island.\cI suspect it has something to do\nwith the ruins here.
Oh, interesting.
Those ruins over there…\cI haven't had any luck in finding\nhow I can get inside.
A battle with you, so high up!
Oh, the heartbreak of losing so\neasily to you!
Experience the joy of climbing!
I'm pretty familiar with the land\naround these parts.
You don't need to be so pushy.\nI'll be happy to tell you.
The door to the ruins…\nIt has these strange patterns\rengraved on the outside.\cI don't know what they mean,\nthough.
I sensed your approach.
Give up…
In your future, I sense that you\nwill meet many others.\cI think you will be linked to each\nother by a strange power.
Somewhere on this island, peculiar\nPOKéMON are sleeping.
What an amazing TRAINER!
Somewhere on this island, peculiar\nPOKéMON are sleeping.\cCould it be that they're waiting\nfor you?
TRAINER TOWER ENTRANCE\nRise to the Challenge, TRAINERS!
TRAINER TOWER AHEAD
トレーナータワーには\nいまは　はいれない　みたい…
トレーナータワーが　あいてる！\nさっそく　はいってみよう！
Kyahaha!\nI'll flick you away effortlessly!
Tch!\nToo strong for me!
What's that?\nI don't act the way I look?\cHeh, that's a part of my strategy!
Howdy!\nAre you a member of my fan club?
Oh, so you're not a fan…\cWell, I can change that.\nLet me sing for you!
Lalalah…\nMy POKéMON, I send them out,\rall the girls scream and shout!
This island is too spread out…\nIt's not easy patrolling the place.
Uh-huh…
TRAINERS like you from cities,\nthey sure are tough.\cYou'll be headed for the TOWER,\nwon't you?
I punish people who abuse\nPOKéMON!
You don't seem to be a problem\nTRAINER.
If you treat your POKéMON with\nkindness, they'll understand.
EVE: I'll team up with JON and\nbattle together.
EVE: Me and JON, we lost.\nEhehe.
EVE: I'm going to work harder with\nJON.
EVE: I want to team up with JON\nwhen I battle you.\cCome back with two POKéMON, okay?
JON: When I'm with EVE, it feels\nlike we could never lose.
JON: When I'm with EVE,\nit doesn't feel like I've lost!
JON: When I'm with EVE, I feel\ngiddy whether I win or lose.\cIt's magical!
JON: If it's with EVE, I'll be\nhappy to battle with you.\cSo, I'd like to make it a\ntwo-on-two battle, if I may.
SEVAULT CANYON ENTRANCE\cTRAINERS are asked to refrain from\ndamaging plants in the CANYON.
My conditioning's in top form!
Huh?\nSomething's not right…
The way I am now, I may have to\nhold off on TRAINER TOWER…
It doesn't matter if you happen to\nhave the strongest POKéMON…\cIt doesn't mean a thing if you don't\nknow how to use them properly!
You're a master at this.
You see them every so often,\nTRAINERS with awesome POKéMON\rwho have no idea what to do.\cBefore training POKéMON, TRAINERS\nthemselves need to grow up.
I work to protect the environment.\nIn turn, nature protects me!
Whoa! You're tough!\nHow about protecting me?
From far out among the stars, our\nplanet is just a drop of water.\cBut we want to protect that drop\nof water for everyone.
Those shoes you have are pretty\nsnazzy.
You're hot stuff in spite of your\ncute looks.
Your mom bought those snazzy\nRUNNING SHOES for you?\cShe must adore you.
You look strong.\nLet me battle you, please!
I knew it!\nYou're as tough as I thought!
The way you battle has given me\na lot of useful data.\cThanks so much!
I was given the best possible\neducation to become this strong.\cI don't want to lose to anyone!
Thank you. I feel like I've been\nset free by losing to you.
For some reason, I get furious\nover the slightest thing.\cI'll calm myself by breathing\ndeeply.
LEX: My darling NYA, together\nwe could win!
LEX: I seem to have been too\ncareless…
LEX: I think it was a good\nexperience for NYA.\cYou have my gratitude.
LEX: May I ask you to battle the\nboth of us at the same time?
NYA: I'll do my best so I won't\ndrag down my mentor, LEX!
NYA: Oh, no…\nI'm so sorry, I…
NYA: I think I'm going to need\nmuch more seasoning and tutoring\runder LEX…\c…So, LEX, please, may I stay with\nyou like this?
NYA: I'm sorry, but may we battle\nin two-on-two style?
SEVAULT CANYON\nTANOBY RUINS AHEAD
Training by oneself is certainly\nnot a bad thing.\cBut it's also not bad to aim for\nthe top with a partner.\cEven BRUNO…\nHe trained with a fellow by the\rname of BRAWLY before.
Do you know anything about this\nstone chamber?
That was uncalled for.\nYou didn't have to be so rough.
The TANOBY RUINS date back at\nleast 1,500 years.\cBut it's a baffling mystery as to\nwhy it was built in the first place.
A mystic POKéMON is said to sleep\ninside here.
I'm not much good in battle.
I hear there are other ruins like\nthe one here.\cMight they be the resting places\nof other mystic POKéMON?
CLIFFORD is teaching me how to\npaint.
We might get in trouble for being\nnoisy here.
I said that I wanted to paint an\nold building.\cSo CLIFFORD brought me here.
Today, in addition to our lesson,\nwe came to see the chamber.
My, how extraordinary.
Ah, so you are studying POKéMON\non your own…\cYes, you certainly are quite the\nextraordinary person, indeed.
MOM: …Right.\nAll boys leave home someday.\rIt said so on TV.\cOh, yes. PROF. OAK, next door, was\nlooking for you.
MOM: …Right.\nAll girls dream of traveling.\rIt said so on TV.\cOh, yes. PROF. OAK, next door, was\nlooking for you.
MOM: [PLAYER]!\nYou should take a quick rest.
MOM: Oh, good! You and your\nPOKéMON are looking great.\rTake care now!
There's a movie on TV.\nFour boys are walking on railroad\rtracks.\c…I better go, too.
There's a movie on TV.\nA girl with her hair in pigtails is\rwalking up a brick road.\c…I better go, too.
Oops, wrong side…
[PLAYER] played with the NES.\c…Okay!\nIt's time to go!
It's a posted notice…\cIf you're confused, ask for HELP!\nPress the L or R Button!
DAISY: Hi, [PLAYER]!\cMy brother, [RIVAL], is out at\nGrandpa's LAB.
DAISY: [PLAYER], I heard you had\na battle against [RIVAL].\cI wish I'd seen that!
Grandpa asked you to run an\nerrand?\cGee, that's lazy of him.\nHere, this will help you.
[PLAYER] received a TOWN MAP\nfrom DAISY.
You don't have space for this in\nyour BAG.
You can use the TOWN MAP to find\nout where you are, or check the\rnames of places.
DAISY: Just like people, POKéMON\nare living things.\cWhen they get tired, please give\nthem a rest.
It's a big map of the KANTO region.\nNow this would be useful!
The shelves are crammed full of\nbooks on POKéMON.
DAISY: Hi, [PLAYER]!\nGood timing.\cI'm about to have some tea.\nWould you like to join me?\cOh, but look.\nYour POKéMON are a little dirty.\cWould you like me to groom one?
You don't need any grooming done?\nOkay, we'll just have tea.
Which one should I groom?
DAISY: Okay, I'll get it looking\nnice in no time.
[FONT_NORMAL][STR_VAR_1] looks dreamily content…\c[FONT_FEMALE]DAISY: There you go! All done.\nSee? Doesn't it look nice?\cGiggle…\nIt's such a cute POKéMON.
Oh, sorry. I honestly can't\ngroom an EGG.
DAISY: Your POKéMON grow to love\nyou if you raise them with love.\cFor example, [PLAYER], may I see\nyour first POKéMON?
It couldn't possibly love you\nany more than it does now.\cYour POKéMON is happy beyond\nwords.
It looks very happy.\cI wish [RIVAL] could see this and\nlearn something from it.
It's quite friendly with you.\nKeep being good to it!
It's warming up to you.\nTrust must be growing between you.
It's not quite familiar with you\nyet.\cPOKéMON are all quite wary when\nyou first get them.
[PLAYER], I don't like the way it\nglares at you.\cCould you try being a little nicer\nto it?
…Um, it's not easy for me to say\nthis, but…\cIs there some reason why your\nPOKéMON would hate you so much?
“The lovely and sweet\nCLEFAIRY”
[RIVAL]: What, it's only [PLAYER]?\nGramps isn't around.
[RIVAL]: Gramps!\nI'm fed up with waiting!
[RIVAL]: Hey! Gramps! No fair!\nWhat about me?
[RIVAL]: Heh, I don't need to be\ngreedy like you. I'm mature!\cGo ahead and choose, [PLAYER]!
[RIVAL]: I'll take this one, then!
[RIVAL] received the [STR_VAR_1]\nfrom PROF. OAK!
[RIVAL]: My POKéMON looks a lot\ntougher than yours.
[RIVAL]: Wait, [PLAYER]!\nLet's check out our POKéMON!\cCome on, I'll take you on!
WHAT?\nUnbelievable!\rI picked the wrong POKéMON!
[RIVAL]: Yeah!\nAm I great or what?
[RIVAL]: Okay! I'll make my\nPOKéMON battle to toughen it up!\c[PLAYER]! Gramps!\nSmell you later!
[RIVAL]: Gramps!
[RIVAL]: I almost forgot!\nWhat did you call me for?
[RIVAL]: All right, Gramps!\nLeave it all to me!
[PLAYER], I hate to say it, but you\nwon't be necessary for this.\cI know! I'll borrow a TOWN MAP\nfrom my sis!\cI'll tell her not to lend you one,\n[PLAYER]! Hahaha!\cDon't bother coming around to\nmy place after this!
OAK: [RIVAL]?\nLet me think…\cOh, that's right, I told you to\ncome! Just wait!\cHere, [PLAYER].\cThere are three POKéMON here.\cHaha!\cThe POKéMON are held inside\nthese POKé BALLS.\cWhen I was young, I was a serious\nPOKéMON TRAINER.\cBut now, in my old age, I have\nonly these three left.\cYou can have one.\nGo on, choose!
OAK: Be patient, [RIVAL].\nYou can have one, too!
OAK: Now, [PLAYER].\cInside those three POKé BALLS are\nPOKéMON.\cWhich one will you choose for\nyourself?
OAK: Hey!\nDon't go away yet!
Ah! CHARMANDER is your choice.\nYou should raise it patiently.\cSo, [PLAYER], you're claiming the\nFIRE POKéMON CHARMANDER?
Hm! SQUIRTLE is your choice.\nIt's one worth raising.\cSo, [PLAYER], you've decided on the\nWATER POKéMON SQUIRTLE?
I see! BULBASAUR is your choice.\nIt's very easy to raise.\cSo, [PLAYER], you want to go with\nthe GRASS POKéMON BULBASAUR?
This POKéMON is really quite\nenergetic!
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_1]\nfrom PROF. OAK!
OAK: If a wild POKéMON appears,\nyour POKéMON can battle it.\cWith it at your side, you should be\nable to reach the next town.
OAK: [PLAYER], raise your young\nPOKéMON by making it battle.\cIt has to battle for it to grow.
OAK: Oh, [PLAYER]!\nHow is my old POKéMON?\cWell, it seems to be growing more\nattached to you.\cYou must be talented as a POKéMON\nTRAINER.\cWhat's that?\nYou have something for me?
[PLAYER] delivered OAK'S PARCEL.
Ah! \nIt's the custom POKé BALL!\cI had it on order.\nThank you!
OAK: Oh, right!\nI have a request for you two.
On the desk there is my invention,\nthe POKéDEX!\cIt automatically records data on\nPOKéMON you've seen or caught.\cIt's a high-tech encyclopedia!
OAK: [PLAYER] and [RIVAL].\nTake these with you.
[PLAYER] received the POKéDEX\nfrom PROF. OAK.
OAK: You can't get detailed data\non POKéMON by just seeing them.\cYou must catch them to obtain\ncomplete data.\cSo, here are some tools for\ncatching wild POKéMON.
[PLAYER] received five POKé BALLS.
When a wild POKéMON appears,\nit's fair game.\cJust throw a POKé BALL at it and\ntry to catch it!\cThis won't always work, however.\cA healthy POKéMON can escape.\nYou have to be lucky!
To make a complete guide on all\nthe POKéMON in the world…\cThat was my dream!\cBut, I'm too old.\nI can't get the job done.\cSo, I want you two to fulfill my\ndream for me.\cGet moving, you two.\cThis is a great undertaking in\nPOKéMON history!
POKéMON around the world wait for\nyou, [PLAYER]!
Ah, [PLAYER]!\nHow is your POKéDEX shaping up?\c[RIVAL] has already caught some\nPOKéMON and added to the data.\cSo, [PLAYER], let's have a look at\nyour POKéDEX.\c…What's the matter?\nYou've added no new data at all.\cI'll give you these, so do try a\nlittle harder.
OAK: Come see me sometime.\cAfter all, I want to know how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along.
It's like an encyclopedia, but the\npages are blank.
Those are POKé BALLS.\nThey contain POKéMON!
That's PROF. OAK's last POKéMON.
Press START to open the MENU!
The SAVE option is on the MENU.\nUse it regularly.
All POKéMON types have strong and\nweak points against others.
There's an e-mail message here.\c…\cFinally!\nThe ultimate TRAINERS of the\rPOKéMON LEAGUE are ready to\rtake on all comers!\cBring your best POKéMON and see\nhow you rate as a TRAINER!\cPOKéMON LEAGUE HQ\nINDIGO PLATEAU\cPROF. OAK, please visit us!\n…
I study POKéMON as PROF. OAK's\nAIDE.
Hi, [PLAYER]. I bet you've become\ngood friends with your POKéMON.\cBy the way, did you know about\nDAISY?\cIf you show DAISY your POKéMON,\nshe can tell how much it likes you.\cOccasionally, she will even groom\na POKéMON for you.\cThis is a secret, so please don't\ntell anyone.
PROF. OAK is going to have his own\nradio show soon.\cThe program will be called PROF.\nOAK's POKéMON SEMINAR.
PROF. OAK may not look like much,\nbut he's the authority on POKéMON.\cMany POKéMON TRAINERS hold him in\nhigh regard.
Ah, now this is excellent!\c[PLAYER], I have another important\nfavor to ask of you.\cI need you to listen closely.
Recently, there have been sightings\nof many rare POKéMON species.\cI'm talking about POKéMON that\nhave never been seen in KANTO.\cI would love to go see things for\nmyself, but I'm much too old.\cSince I can't do it, [PLAYER], I'd\nlike you to go in my place.
[RIVAL]: Hey, I heard that!\cGramps, what's with favoring\n[PLAYER] over me all the time?\cI went and collected more POKéMON,\nand faster, too.\cYou should just let me handle\neverything.
OAK: I know, I know.\nOf course I need your help, too.\cNow, I need to see both your\nPOKéDEXES.
PROF. OAK took both POKéDEX\nunits.
… … …  … … …\c… … …  … … …\c…And that's done!\cNow these units can record data on\na lot more POKéMON.
[PLAYER]'s POKéDEX was upgraded!
Now, [PLAYER] and [RIVAL]!\cThis time, you really must work\ntowards filling your POKéDEXES.\cI urge you to make them the best\nand the most complete of all time!\cTruly, this is a monumentally great\nundertaking in POKéMON history!
[RIVAL]: Gramps, calm down.\nDon't get so excited.\cI'll get the POKéDEX completed,\ndon't you worry about a thing.\cI think I'll try looking around\nONE ISLAND first…\cAnyways, I'm outta here!
Coming up with nicknames is fun,\nbut it's not so easy to do.\cClever names are nice, but simple\nnames are easier to remember.
My daddy loves POKéMON, too.
SPEARY: Tetweet!
SPEAROW\nName: SPEARY
Fwahahaha!\nWelcome to my hideout!\cIt shall be so until I can restore\nTEAM ROCKET to its former glory.\cBut, you have found me again.\nSo be it.\rThis time, I'm not holding back!\cOnce more, you shall face\nGIOVANNI, the greatest TRAINER![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_ROCKET]
Ha!\nThat was a truly intense fight.\rYou have won!\cAs proof, here is the EARTHBADGE!\n[PAUSE_MUSIC][PLAY_BGM MUS_OBTAIN_BADGE][PAUSE 254][PAUSE 86][RESUME_MUSIC]
Having lost in this fashion, \nI can't face my followers.\rI have betrayed their trust.\cAs of today, TEAM ROCKET is\nfinished forever!\cAs for myself, I shall dedicate\nmy life to training again.\cLet us meet again someday!\nFarewell!
The EARTHBADGE makes POKéMON of\nany level obey without question.\cIt is evidence of your mastery as\na POKéMON TRAINER.\cWith it, you can challenge the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE.\cAlso, take this TM.\cConsider it a gift for your POKéMON\nLEAGUE challenge.
[PLAYER] received TM26\nfrom GIOVANNI.
TM26 contains EARTHQUAKE.\cIt is a powerful attack that causes\na massive tremor.\cI made it when I ran the GYM here,\nfar too long ago… 
You do not have space for this!
Heh!\nYou must be running out of steam\rby now!
I ran out of gas!
You'll need power to keep up with\nour GYM LEADER.
Rrrroar!\nI'm working myself into a rage!
Wargh!
I'm still not worthy!
POKéMON and I, we make wonderful\nmusic together!
You are in perfect harmony!
Do you know the identity of our\nGYM LEADER?
Karate is the ultimate form of\nmartial arts!
Aiyah!
If my POKéMON were as good at\nkarate as I…
The truly talented win with style.
I lost my grip!
The LEADER will scold me for\nlosing this way…
I'm the KARATE KING!\nYour fate rests with me!
Ayah!
The POKéMON LEAGUE?\nYou? Don't get cocky!
Your POKéMON will cower at the\ncrack of my whip!
Yowch!\nWhiplash!
Wait!\nI was just careless!
VIRIDIAN GYM was closed for a\nlong time.\cBut now, our LEADER is back!
I was beaten?
You can go on to the POKéMON\nLEAGUE only by defeating our GYM\rLEADER!
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cEven I don't know the VIRIDIAN\nLEADER's identity.\cBut one thing's certain.\nThis will be the toughest of all\rthe GYM LEADERS.\cAlso, I heard that the TRAINERS\nhere like GROUND-type POKéMON.
Blow me away! GIOVANNI was the\nGYM LEADER of VIRIDIAN?

Whew! I'm trying to memorize all my\nnotes.
Okay!\cBe sure to read what's on the\nblackboard carefully!
Let's check out the notebook.\cFirst page…\cPOKé BALLS are used to catch\nPOKéMON.\cUp to six POKéMON can be carried\nin your party.\cPeople who raise and battle\nwith POKéMON are called TRAINERS.
Second page…\cA healthy POKéMON may be hard to\ncatch, so weaken it first.\cPoison, burn, or cause another\nstatus problem to weaken it.
Third page…\cPOKéMON TRAINERS seek others to\nengage in POKéMON battles.\cTo TRAINERS, the taste of victory\nis sweet, indeed.\cBattles are constantly waged at\nPOKéMON GYMS everywhere.
Fourth page…\cThe ultimate goal for all POKéMON\nTRAINERS is simple.\cIt is to defeat the top eight\nPOKéMON GYM LEADERS.\cDo so to earn the right to face…\cThe ELITE FOUR of the POKéMON\nLEAGUE!
Turn the page?
GIRL: Hey!\nDon't look at my notes!
The blackboard lists POKéMON\nSTATUS problems during battles.
Which topic do you want to read?
A POKéMON can't attack if it's\nasleep.\cPOKéMON will stay asleep even\nafter battles.\cUse AWAKENING to awaken one\nfrom sleep.
A burn reduces ATTACK power.\nIt also causes ongoing HP loss.\cA burn remains after a battle.\nUse BURN HEAL to cure a burn.
When poisoned, a POKéMON's health\nsteadily drops.\cPoison lingers after battles.\nUse an ANTIDOTE to cure poison!
A frozen POKéMON becomes\nhelplessly immobile.\cIt stays frozen even after the\nbattle ends.\cUse ICE HEAL to thaw out the\nsuffering POKéMON.
Paralysis reduces SPEED and may\nprevent the POKéMON from moving.\cParalysis remains after battles.\nUse PARLYZ HEAL for treatment.
Hey!\nYou came from PALLET TOWN?
You know PROF. OAK, right?\cHis order came in.\nCan I get you to take it to him?
[PLAYER] received OAK'S PARCEL\nfrom the POKéMON MART clerk.
Okay, thanks! Please say hi to\nPROF. OAK for me, too.
This shop does good business in\nANTIDOTES, I've heard.
I've got to buy some POTIONS.\cYou never know when your POKéMON\nwill need quick healing.
Please feel free to use that PC in\nthe corner.\cThe receptionist told me so.\nIt's so kind of her!
There's a POKéMON CENTER in every\ntown ahead.\cThey charge no money, so don't\nbe shy about healing POKéMON.
POKéMON CENTERS heal your tired,\nhurt, or fainted POKéMON.\cThey make all POKéMON completely\nhealthy.
Yes, yes.\nIt's $50 for a child's ticket.\cWould you like to come in?
Come again!
Right, $50!\nThank you!
You don't have enough money.
Please enjoy yourself.
You can't sneak in the back way!\nNice try, kid, but no.\cOh, whatever!\nDo you know what AMBER is?
AMBER contains the genetic matter\nof ancient POKéMON.\cThere's a LAB somewhere trying to\nresurrect POKéMON from AMBER.
AMBER is actually sap, that gooey\nstuff that oozes from trees.\cThe ancient sap fossilized over\ntime to become rock-hard AMBER.
あちらへ　おまわりください
I should be grateful for my long\nlife.\cNever did I think I would get to\nsee the bones of a dragon!
Ssh! Listen, I need to share a\nsecret with someone.\cI think that this chunk of AMBER\ncontains POKéMON DNA!\cIt would be a shattering scientific\nbreakthrough if POKéMON could be\rresurrected from it.\cBut, my colleagues just ignore\nwhat I have to say.\cSo, I have a favor to ask!\cI want you to get this examined at\na POKéMON LAB somewhere.
[PLAYER] received the OLD AMBER\nfrom the man.
Ssh!\nGet the OLD AMBER checked!
You don't have space for this.
We have two fossils of rare,\nprehistoric POKéMON on exhibit.
There is a beautiful piece of\nAMBER in a clear gold color.
AERODACTYL Fossil\nA primitive and rare POKéMON.
KABUTOPS Fossil\nA primitive and rare POKéMON.
The secrets of space…\nThe mysteries of earth…\cThere are so many things about\nwhich we know so little.\cBut that should spur us to study\nharder, not toss in the towel.\cThe only thing you should toss…\cWell, how about SEISMIC TOSS?\nShould I teach that to a POKéMON?
Is that so?\nI'm sure you'll be back for it.
Which POKéMON wants to learn\nSEISMIC TOSS?
I hope you won't toss in the towel.\nKeep it up.
MOON STONE, huh?\cWhat's so special about it?\nLooks like an ordinary rock to me.
July 20, 1969!\cHumankind first set foot on the\nmoon that day.\cI bought a color TV just so I\ncould watch that news.
This month, we're running a space\nexhibit.
I want a PIKACHU!\nIt's so cute!\cI asked my daddy to catch me one!
Yeah, a PIKACHU soon, I promise!

So, you're here. I'm BROCK.\nI'm PEWTER's GYM LEADER.\cMy rock-hard willpower is evident\neven in my POKéMON.\cMy POKéMON are all rock hard, and\nhave true-grit determination.\cThat's right - my POKéMON are all\nthe ROCK type!\cFuhaha! You're going to challenge\nme knowing that you'll lose?\cThat's the TRAINER's honor that\ncompels you to challenge me.\cFine, then!\nShow me your best![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
I took you for granted, and so\nI lost.\cAs proof of your victory, I confer\non you this…the official POKéMON\rLEAGUE BOULDERBADGE.\c[FONT_NORMAL][PLAYER] received the BOULDERBADGE\nfrom BROCK![PAUSE_MUSIC][PLAY_BGM MUS_OBTAIN_BADGE][PAUSE 254][PAUSE 86][RESUME_MUSIC]\c[FONT_MALE]Just having the BOULDERBADGE makes\nyour POKéMON more powerful.\cIt also enables the use of the\nmove FLASH outside of battle.\cOf course, a POKéMON must know the\nmove FLASH to use it.
Wait!\nTake this with you.
[PLAYER] received TM39\nfrom BROCK.
A TM, Technical Machine, contains a\ntechnique for POKéMON.\cUsing a TM teaches the move it\ncontains to a POKéMON.\cA TM is good for only one use.\cSo, when you use one, pick the\nPOKéMON carefully.\cAnyways…\nTM39 contains ROCK TOMB.\cIt hurls boulders at the foe and\nlowers its SPEED.
There are all kinds of TRAINERS in\nthis huge world of ours.\cYou appear to be very gifted as a\nPOKéMON TRAINER.\cSo let me make a suggestion.\cGo to the GYM in CERULEAN and test\nyour abilities.
You don't have room for this.
Stop right there, kid!\cYou're ten thousand light-years \nfrom facing BROCK!
Darn!\cLight-years isn't time…\nIt measures distance!
You're pretty hot.\n…But not as hot as BROCK!
Hiya!\nDo you want to dream big?\cDo you dare to dream of becoming\nthe POKéMON champ?\cI'm no TRAINER, but I can advise\nyou on how to win.\cLet me take you to the top!
All right!\nLet's get happening!
The first POKéMON out in a match is\nat the left of the POKéMON LIST.\cBy changing the order of POKéMON,\nyou may gain an advantage.\cTry different orders to suit your\nopponent's party.
It's a free service!\nLet's get happening!
Just as I thought!\nYou're POKéMON champ material!

A shady old guy sucked me into\nbuying this weird fish POKéMON!\cIt's totally weak and it cost $500!
Good things can happen if you raise\nPOKéMON diligently.\cEven the weak ones can surprise\nyou if you don't give up on them.
NIDORAN♂: Bowbow!
NIDORAN, sit!
Our POKéMON's an outsider, so it's\nfinicky and hard to handle.\cAn outsider is a POKéMON that you\nget in a trade.\cIt grows fast, but it may ignore an\nunskilled TRAINER in battle.\cIf only we had some BADGES…
What!?\cTEAM ROCKET is at MT. MOON?\nHuh?\cI'm on the phone!\nScram!
JIGGLYPUFF: Puu pupuu!
Yawn!\cWhen JIGGLYPUFF sings, POKéMON get\ndrowsy…\c…Me, too…\nSnore…
I really want a PIKACHU, so I'm\ntrading my CLEFAIRY for one.
I'm trading POKéMON with that kid\nthere.\cI had two PIKACHU, so I figured\nI might as well trade one.
POKéMON learn new techniques as\nthey grow.\cBut some moves must be taught to\nthem by people.
A POKéMON becomes easier to \ncatch if it has a status problem.\cSleep, poison, burn, or paralysis…\nThose are all effective.\cBut catching POKéMON is never\na sure thing!
Only skilled TRAINERS can collect\nPOKéMON BADGES.\cI see you have at least one.\cThose BADGES have amazing secrets,\ndid you know?
Now then…\cWhich of the eight BADGES should\nI describe?
Come visit me anytime you wish.
The ATTACK stat of all your\nPOKéMON increases a little bit.\cIt also lets you use the move\nFLASH outside of battle.
POKéMON up to Lv. 30 will obey\nyou.\cThat includes even outsiders you\nobtain in trades.\cPOKéMON of higher levels will\nbe unruly in battle, however.\cIt also lets you use the move\nCUT outside of battle.
The SPEED stat of all your\nPOKéMON increases a little bit.\cIt also lets you use the move\nFLY outside of battle.
POKéMON up to Lv. 50 will obey\nyou.\cThat includes even outsiders you\nobtain in trades.\cPOKéMON of higher levels will\nbe unruly in battle, however.\cIt also lets you use the move\nSTRENGTH outside of battle.
The DEFENSE stat of all your\nPOKéMON increases a little bit.\cIt also lets you use the move\nSURF outside of battle.
POKéMON up to Lv. 70 will obey\nyou.\cThat includes even outsiders you\nobtain in trades.\cPOKéMON of higher levels will\nbe unruly in battle, however.\cIt also lets you use the move\nROCK SMASH outside of battle.
The SP. ATK and SP. DEF stats of\nall your POKéMON rise a little bit.\cIt also lets you use the move\nWATERFALL outside of battle.
All POKéMON will obey you!
Those miserable ROCKETS!\cLook what they've done to my\nhouse!\cThey stole a TM for teaching\nPOKéMON how to DIG holes!\cI was going to use it on a\nMANKEY or a SANDSHREW…\cThat cost me a bundle, it did!
I figure what's lost is lost.\cI decided to teach DIGLETT how to\nDIG without a TM.
TEAM ROCKET must be trying to DIG\ntheir way into no good!
TEAM ROCKET left a way out!
My husband likes trading POKéMON.\cYou're collecting POKéMON for your\nPOKéDEX, aren't you?\cWould you please trade with him?
That BILL!\cI heard that he'll do whatever it\ntakes to get rare POKéMON.\cHe's not above doing all sorts\nof things, I've heard.
Have you heard about BILL?\cEveryone calls him a POKéMANIAC!\cI think people are just jealous of\nBILL, though.\cWho wouldn't want to boast about\ntheir POKéMON?
BILL has lots of POKéMON!\nHe collects rare ones, too!
Why don't you go upstairs and try\ntrading POKéMON with your friends?\cYou could get a lot more variety\nby trading.\cThe POKéMON you get in trades grow\nquickly, too.
Hi, you're a new face!\cOnly those TRAINERS who have a\npolicy about POKéMON can turn pro.\cWhat is your approach when you\ncatch and train POKéMON?\cMy policy is an all-out offensive\nwith WATER-type POKéMON![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
TM03 teaches WATER PULSE.\cUse it on an aquatic POKéMON!
The CASCADEBADGE makes all\nPOKéMON up to Lv. 30 obey.\cThat includes even outsiders you\ngot in trades.\cThere's more. You can now use CUT\nanytime, even out of battle.\cYou can CUT down small trees to\nopen new pathways.\cYou can also have my favorite TM.
[PLAYER] received TM03\nfrom MISTY.
You better make room for this!
Wow!\nYou're too much!\cAll right!\cYou can have the CASCADEBADGE to\nshow you beat me.
What? You?\nI'm more than good enough for you!\cMISTY won't have to be bothered.
You overwhelmed me!
You have to face other TRAINERS\nto see how good you really are.
Splash!\cI'm first up!\nLet's do it!
That can't be!
MISTY is a TRAINER who's going to\nkeep improving.\cShe won't lose to someone like you!
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cLet me give you some advice!\cThe LEADER, MISTY, is a pro who\nuses WATER-type POKéMON.\cYou can drain all their water with\nGRASS-type POKéMON.\cOr, you might use ELECTRIC-type\nPOKéMON and zap them!
You beat MISTY!\nSee, what'd I tell ya?\cYou and me, kid, we make a pretty\ndarn-good team!

Hi!\nWelcome to our BIKE SHOP.\cHave we got just the BIKE for\nyou!
Sorry!\nYou can't afford it!
Oh, that's…\cA BIKE VOUCHER!\cOkay!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] exchanged the\nBIKE VOUCHER for a BICYCLE.
Thank you!\nCome back again sometime!
How do you like your new BICYCLE?\nDo you like how it rides?\cYou can take it out on CYCLING\nROAD and even into caves!
You better make room for your\nBICYCLE!
A plain city bike is good enough\nfor me.\cAfter all, you can't put a shopping\nbasket on a mountain bike.
These bikes are cool, but they're\nway expensive!
Wow.\nYour BIKE is really cool!
ついに　はつばい！\cドイツ　せい　さいこうきゅう\nおりたたみ　じてんしゃ！
A shiny new BICYCLE!
REPEL not only keeps bugs away,\nit also works on weak POKéMON.\cPut your strongest POKéMON at the\nleft of the POKéMON LIST.\cIf your first POKéMON is strong,\nREPEL's effect is boosted.
Do you know about RARE CANDY?\nThey don't sell it in shops.\cI think it makes POKéMON grow\nvery quickly all of a sudden.
Sigh…\nToo much time, too little to do…\cIs nothing entertaining happening\nanywhere?
Ah!\nA new news report!\cHmm…\cI see!\nThat was quite informative!\cI applaud you for taking interest\nin the news at your young age.\cAs my thanks for sharing the news\nwith me, I want you to have this.
Oh, oh!\nTh-this news report!\cHmm…\cAmazing!\nWhat an incredible piece of news!\cI haven't seen a news story this\nincredible in too long a time!\cThanks for sharing this fantastic\nnews. Have a bunch of BERRIES!
It seems such a shame to not share\nthis news with other folks…\cI wish I could tell someone…\nLet others know the news…
Ah, you've spread the news for me?\cGood news becomes worthwhile when\nall sorts of people share it.\cAs my thanks for your spreading\nthe news, take this!
You've spread the news some more?\nMagnificent!\cThat piece of news must be\ndelighted to be passed around so.\cYes, indeed!\cConsider this a show of\nappreciation from me and the news.\cI'll give you more BERRIES than\nI usually do.
I'm quite enjoying myself with all\nsorts of news.\cYes, I am satisfied!\nI won't be bored for a while.
Hm? Your BERRY POUCH is full.\nMy gift remains ungiven, then.
I concoct a variety of medicine\nfrom BERRY POWDER.\cUsing good BERRY POWDER, I can\nmake any kind of medicine.\cNow tell me, have you any interest\nin BERRIES?
Ah, good! For you, then, I have\njust the thing.
There's something new on the second\nfloor of POKéMON CENTERS, at the\rDIRECT CORNER.\cThey installed a Wireless Adapter\nmachine for crushing BERRIES.\cThis is where you come in.\cI have a favor to ask, one that\nI can entrust only to you.\cCould you make BERRY POWDER for\nme using that machine?\cDon't forget, the machine is at the\nDIRECT CORNER of POKéMON CENTERS.\cI'll concoct medicine for you if\nyou bring me some BERRY POWDER.\cDon't forget, crush BERRIES into\nBERRY POWDER and bring it to me.
Why must you lie to me?\cHow many BERRIES do you have?\nNot a one!
You have no interest in BERRIES?\cYoung one, it's important to take an\ninterest in all sorts of things.
Er-hem! Have you brought me some\nBERRY POWDER?
With what would you like to \nexchange it?
Fine, you'll exchange your BERRY\nPOWDER for one [STR_VAR_1]?
Hm? You don't have enough\nBERRY POWDER.
This is fine BERRY POWDER indeed.\nIt will make excellent medicine.\cWould you like to trade more BERRY\nPOWDER for something else?
That's fine, then.\nI'll hope to see you back again.
Come see me if you'd like to trade\nyour BERRY POWDER.

I recently moved to this town.\cI hear that MR. FUJI's not from\nthese parts originally, either.
That's odd, MR. FUJI isn't here.\nWhere'd he go?
MR. FUJI had been praying alone\nfor CUBONE's mother.
This is really MR. FUJI's house.\cHe's really kind.\cHe looks after abandoned and\norphaned POKéMON.
It's so warm!\nPOKéMON are so nice to hug.
NIDORINO: Gaoo!
PSYDUCK: Gwappa!
MR. FUJI: [PLAYER]…\cYour POKéDEX quest is one that\nrequires strong dedication.\cWithout deep love for POKéMON,\nyour quest may fail.\cI'm not sure if this will help you,\nbut I'd like you to have it.
[PLAYER] received a POKé FLUTE\nfrom MR. FUJI.
Upon hearing the POKé FLUTE,\nsleeping POKéMON will spring awake.\cTry using it on POKéMON that are\nsleeping obstacles.
You must make room for this!
MR. FUJI: Has my POKé FLUTE\nhelped you?
POKéMON FAN MAGAZINE\nMonthly Grand Prize Drawing!\cThe application form is…\cGone! It's been clipped out.\nSomeone must have applied already.
POKéMON magazines line the shelf.\cPOKéMON INSIDER…\cPOKéMON FAN…
CUBONE: Kyarugoo!
Those horrible ROCKETS!\nThey deserve no mercy!\cThat poor CUBONE's mother…\cIt was killed trying to escape from\nTEAM ROCKET.
The ghost of POKéMON TOWER is\ngone!\cSomeone must have soothed its\nrestless spirit!
Hello, hello!\nI am the official NAME RATER!\cWant me to rate the nicknames of\nyour POKéMON?
Which POKéMON's nickname should\nI critique?
[STR_VAR_1], is it?\nThat is a decent nickname!\cBut, would you like me to give it\na nicer name?\cHow about it?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!
I see.\nDo come visit again.
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as [STR_VAR_1]!\cIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\cHow fortunate for you!
[STR_VAR_1], is it?\nThat is a truly impeccable name!\cTake good care of [STR_VAR_1]!
Now, now.\nThat is merely an EGG!
I'm searching for items that raise\nthe stats of POKéMON.\cThey're effective over the course\nof a single battle.\cX ATTACK, X DEFEND, X SPEED, \nand X SPECIAL are what I'm after.\cDo you know where I can get them?
Did you buy some REVIVES?\nThey revive any fainted POKéMON!
Sometimes, a TRAINER duo will\nchallenge you with two POKéMON\rat the same time.\cIf that happens, you have to send\nout two POKéMON to battle, too.

I'm the FISHING GURU!\cI simply looove fishing!\nI can't bear to go without.\cTell me, do you like to fish?
Grand! I like your style.\nI think we can be friends.\cTake this and fish, young friend!
[PLAYER] received an OLD ROD from\nthe FISHING GURU.
Fishing is a way of life!\nIt is like the finest poetry.\cFrom the seas to rivers, go out\nand land the big one, my friend.
Oh…\nThat's so disappointing…
Hello there, [PLAYER]!\cHow are the fish biting?
Oh, no!\cI had a nice gift for you, but you\nhave no room for it!
Even if they are the same level,\nPOKéMON can have very different\rstats and abilities.\cA POKéMON raised by a TRAINER is\nstronger than one in the wild.
My POKéMON was poisoned!\nIt fainted while we were walking!
It is true that a higher-level\nPOKéMON will be more powerful…\cBut, all POKéMON will have weak\npoints against specific types.\cSo, there appears to be no\nuniversally strong POKéMON.
The urge to battle with someone\nyou've tangled with before…\cHave you ever had that urge?\nI'm sure you have.\cI wanted to battle certain people\nagain over and over, too.\cSo, I've been giving these away.\nPlease, take one!
Use that device and you'll find\nTRAINERS looking for a rematch.\cYou have to charge its battery to\nuse it, though.
How do you use the VS SEEKER?\nThere's nothing to it.\cUse it like beep-beep-beep, and\nTRAINERS around you will notice.\cIf any TRAINER wants a rematch,\nit will let you know immediately.\cCharge its battery and use it\nwhile you're on a road.
Won't you admire my PIKACHU's\nadorable tail?
Humph!\cMy PIKACHU is twice as cute as\nthat one!
I just adore my SEEL!\nIt's so lovable!\cIt squeals, “Kyuuuh,” when I\nhug it!
Oh, dear!\cMy SEEL is far more attractive.\nBy double, I would say.
PIKACHU: Chu! Pikachu!
SEEL: Kyuoo!
I chair the POKéMON Fan Club!\cI raise more than a hundred\nPOKéMON!\cI'm very fussy when it comes to\nPOKéMON! I surely am!\cSo…\cDid you come visit to hear about\nmy POKéMON?
Good!\nThen listen up!\cMy favorite RAPIDASH…\cIt's…cute…lovely…smart… \nplus…amazing…you think so?…\roh yes…it's…stunning…\rkindly…love it!\cHug it…when…sleeping…warm\nand cuddly…spectacular…\rravishing…\r…Oops! Look at the time!\rI kept you too long!\cThanks for hearing me out!\nI want you to have this!
[PLAYER] received a BIKE VOUCHER\nfrom the CHAIRMAN.
Take that BIKE VOUCHER to the\nBIKE SHOP in CERULEAN CITY.\cExchange that for a BICYCLE\nfree of charge!\cDon't worry, my favorite FEAROW\nwill FLY me anywhere I need to go.\cSo, I have no need for a BICYCLE.\cI hope you like cycling!
Oh. Come back when you want to\nhear my story!
Hello, [PLAYER]!\cDid you come see me about my\nPOKéMON again?\cNo?\nToo bad!
Make room for this!
Our CHAIRMAN is very vocal about\nPOKéMON.
Let's all listen politely to other\nTRAINERS!
If someone brags, brag right back!
Our CHAIRMAN really does adore his\nPOKéMON.\cBut the person who is most liked by\nPOKéMON is DAISY, I think.
Hi!\nDo you have a [STR_VAR_1]?\cWant to trade it for my\n[STR_VAR_2]?
That's too bad.
…This is no [STR_VAR_1].\cIf you get one, please trade it\nto me!
Thank you!
How is my old [STR_VAR_2]?\cMy [STR_VAR_1] is doing great!
There are wicked people who will\nuse POKéMON for criminal acts.\cTEAM ROCKET traffics in rare\nPOKéMON, for example.\cThey also abandon POKéMON that\nthey consider unpopular or useless.\cThat's the sort of horrid people\nthey are, TEAM ROCKET.
I think POKéMON can be good or\nbad. It depends on the TRAINER.
Hey, kid! What do you think you're\ndoing here?\cYou won't live long in combat!\nNot with your puny power!\cI tell you, kid, electric POKéMON\nsaved me during the war!\cThey zapped my enemies into\nparalysis!\cThe same as I'll do to you![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
A little word of advice, kid!\cElectricity is sure powerful!\cBut, it's useless against GROUND-\ntype POKéMON!
The THUNDERBADGE cranks up your\nPOKéMON's SPEED!\cIt also lets your POKéMON FLY\nlightning-quick anytime, kid!\cYou're special, kid!\nTake this!
[PLAYER] received TM34\nfrom LT. SURGE.
TM34 contains SHOCK WAVE!\cTeach it to an ELECTRIC POKéMON!
Yo, kid, make room in your BAG!
Now that's a shocker!\cYou're the real deal, kid!\cFine, then, take the THUNDERBADGE!
When I was in the Army, LT. SURGE\nwas my strict CO.\cHe was a hard taskmaster.
Stop!\nYou're very good!
It's not easy opening that door.\cLT. SURGE was always famous for\nhis cautious nature in the Army.
I'm a lightweight, but I'm good\nwith electricity!\cThat's why I joined this GYM.
Fried!
Okay, I'll talk!\cLT. SURGE said he hid door\nswitches inside something.
This is no place for kids!\nNot even if you're good!
Wow!\nSurprised me!
LT. SURGE installed the traps in\nthe GYM himself.\cHe set up double locks everywhere.\nLet me give you a hint.\cWhen you open the first lock, the\nsecond lock is right next to it.
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cLT. SURGE has a nickname.\cPeople refer to him as the\nLightning American!\cHe's an expert on electric\nPOKéMON.\cBIRD/WATER-type POKéMON match\npoorly against the ELECTRIC type.\cBeware of paralysis, too.\cLT. SURGE is very cautious.\cHe's locked himself in, so it won't\nbe easy getting to him.
Whew!\nThat match was electric!

Oh, you were looking at ERIKA…\nYou weren't looking at me…
Look, look!\nSee my POKéMON!\cI like the GRASS type.\nI like how they're easy to raise.
No!
We only use GRASS-type POKéMON at\nour GYM.\cWhy? We also use them for making\nflower arrangements!
Oh, hey!\cWe don't like BUG- or FIRE-type\nPOKéMON in here!

Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!
For just $500, you can play the\nSAFARI GAME.\cYou can roam the wide-open safari\nand catch what you like.\cWould you like to play?
That'll be $500, please!\cWe only use a special kind of \nPOKé BALLS here.
[PLAYER] received 30 SAFARI BALLS\nfrom the attendant.
We'll call you on the PA when you\nrun out of time or SAFARI BALLS.\cWell, I'll wish you the best of\nluck!
Okay.\nPlease come again!
Oops!\nNot enough money!
Are you going to leave the\nSAFARI ZONE early?
Please return any SAFARI BALLS\nyou may have left.
Good luck!
Did you catch your fair share?\nCome again!
Hi! Is it your first time here at\nthe SAFARI ZONE?
The SAFARI ZONE actually has\nfour zones in it.\cEach zone has different kinds of\nPOKéMON, even some rare ones.\cUse the supplied SAFARI BALLS to\ncatch them.\cYou can also throw BAIT or ROCKS\nbesides the SAFARI BALLS.\cIf you throw BAIT, the POKéMON\nbecomes less likely to flee, but\rharder to catch.\cIf you throw ROCKS, the POKéMON\nbecomes more likely to flee, but\reasier to catch.\cWhen you run out of time or SAFARI\nBALLS, it's game over for you!
Sorry, you're a regular here!
Don't they have any pennants\npromoting the SAFARI ZONE?\cHow about some paper lanterns?\nAren't there even any calendars?
Did you try X SPEED?\nIt speeds up a POKéMON in battle.
We nicknamed the WARDEN\n“SLOWPOKE.”\cYou know, he has that vacant look\nlike a SLOWPOKE.
WARDEN SLOWPOKE is very\nknowledgeable about POKéMON.\cHe even has some fossils of rare,\nextinct POKéMON.
WARDEN SLOWPOKE came in, but\nI couldn't understand him.\cI think he's got a speech problem!
WARDEN SLOWPOKE is running a\npromotion campaign right now.\cTry to get to the farthest corner\nof the SAFARI ZONE.\cIf you can make it, you'll win a\nvery convenient prize.
KOGA: Fwahahaha!\cA mere child like you dares to\nchallenge me?\cThe very idea makes me shiver\nwith mirth!\cVery well, I shall show you true\nterror as a ninja master.\cPoison brings steady doom.\nSleep renders foes helpless.\cDespair to the creeping horror of\nPOISON-type POKéMON![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
Humph!\nYou have proven your worth!\cHere!\nTake the SOULBADGE!
When afflicted by TOXIC, a POKéMON\nsuffers more and more.\cIt suffers worsening damage as the\nbattle wears on!\cIt will surely terrorize foes!
Now that you have the SOULBADGE,\nthe DEFENSE of your POKéMON rises.\cIt also lets you SURF outside of\nbattle.\cAh!\nTake this, too!
[PLAYER] received TM06\nfrom KOGA.
Sealed within that TM06 lies\nTOXIC!\cIt is a secret technique dating\nback some four hundred years.
Make space for this, child!
Strength isn't the key for POKéMON.\nDo you understand this?\cPOKéMON is about strategy!\cI'll show you how strategy can\nbeat brute strength.
What?\nExtraordinary!
So, you mix brawn with brains?\nGood strategy!\cThat's remarkable for a child\nTRAINER.
I was a magician once upon a time.\cBut I dreamt of becoming a ninja,\nso I joined this GYM.
I'm done for!
Even though I've lost, I will keep\ntraining according to the teachings\rof KOGA, my ninja master.
Let's see you beat my special\ntechniques!
You had me fooled!
I like poison and sleep techniques,\nas they linger after battle!
Stop right there!\cThe famed invisible walls of\nFUCHSIA GYM have you frustrated?
Whoa!\nYou've got it!
You impressed me!\nHere's a hint!\cLook very closely for gaps in the\ninvisible walls!
I also study the way of the ninja\nwith Master KOGA!\cNinja have a long history of using\nanimals!
Awoo!
I still have much to learn.
Master KOGA comes from a long line\nof ninjas.\cWhat did you descend from?
You're more skilled than I'd\nthought!
Where there is light, there is\nshadow!\cLight and shadow!\nWhich do you choose?
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cFUCHSIA GYM is a tricked-up place.\nIt's riddled with invisible walls!\cKOGA might appear close, but he's\nblocked off.\cYou have to find gaps in the walls\nto reach him.

BILL files his own POKéMON data on\nhis PC.\cDid he show you?
You can't become a good TRAINER\nwith just one strong POKéMON.\cBut raising many POKéMON evenly\nis no easy task, either.
There's a narrow trail west of\nVIRIDIAN CITY.\cIt goes to the POKéMON LEAGUE HQ.\nThe HQ governs all TRAINERS.

WARDEN: Thanks, son!\nYou're a real lifesaver!\cNo one could understand a word\nthat I said, not a one!\cI was too ashamed to show my face\naround the OFFICE, even.\cLet me give you something for your\ntrouble.
WARDEN: Thank you, lassie!\nYou're a real lifesaver!\cNo one could understand a word\nthat I said, not a one!\cI was too ashamed to show my face\naround the OFFICE, even.\cLet me give you something for your\ntrouble.
[PLAYER] received HM04\nfrom the WARDEN.
WARDEN: Inside HM04 you'll find\nSTRENGTH.\cIt lets POKéMON move boulders when\nyou're outside of battle.\cOh yes, did you find the SECRET\nHOUSE in the SAFARI ZONE?
なんや　にもつ\nいっぱいやんけ！
POKéMON photos and fossils are on\ndisplay.
Old POKéMON merchandise is on\ndisplay.
I'm the FISHING GURU's older\nbrother.\cI simply looove fishing!\nI can't bear to go without.\cTell me, do you like to fish?
Grand! I like your style.\nI think we can be friends.\cTake this and fish, young friend!
[PLAYER] received a GOOD ROD from\nthe FISHING GURU's brother.
Fishing is a way of life!\nIt is like the finest poetry.\cA crummy OLD ROD could only catch\nMAGIKARP, yes?\cBut with a GOOD ROD, you can\ncatch much better POKéMON.
Oh…\nThat's so disappointing…
Hello there, [PLAYER]!\cHow are the fish biting?
Oh, no!\cI had a gift for you, but you have\nno room for it!
Uh…\nOh, yes, I'm the MOVE DELETER.\cI can make POKéMON forget their\nmoves.\cWould you like me to do that?
Which POKéMON should forget a\nmove?
Which move should be forgotten?
[STR_VAR_1] seems to know only one\nmove…
Hm! [STR_VAR_1]'s [STR_VAR_2]?\nThat move should be forgotten?
It worked to perfection!\c[STR_VAR_1] has forgotten\n[STR_VAR_2] completely.
Come again if there are other\nmoves to be forgotten.
What?\nNo EGG should know any moves.
Hah!\cI am BLAINE, the red-hot LEADER\nof CINNABAR GYM!\cMy fiery POKéMON are all rough\nand ready with intense heat!\cThey incinerate all challengers!\cHah!\nYou better have BURN HEAL![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
I have burned down to nothing!\nNot even ashes remain!\cYou have earned the VOLCANOBADGE.
FIRE BLAST is the ultimate fire\ntechnique.\cDon't waste it on WATER POKéMON.
Hah!\cThe VOLCANOBADGE heightens the\nSPECIAL stats of your POKéMON.\cHere, you can have this, too!
[PLAYER] received TM38\nfrom BLAINE.
TM38 contains FIRE BLAST.\nTeach it to FIRE-type POKéMON.\cVULPIX or CHARMELEON would be\nideal for that move.
Make space for this, child!
Do you know how hot POKéMON fire\nbreath can get?
Yow!\nHot, hot, hot!
Fire, or to be more precise,\ncombustion…\c…Oxygen in the air…\nBlah, blah, blah, blah…
I was a thief, but I went straight\nas a TRAINER.
I surrender!
I get this uncontrollable urge to\nsteal other people's POKéMON.
I've studied POKéMON thoroughly.\nYou can't win!
Waah!\nMy studies were insufficient!
My theories are too complicated\nfor you to understand.
I like using FIRE-type POKéMON.\nI just do.
Too hot to handle!
I wish there were a thief POKéMON.\nI'd use that!
I know why BLAINE became a\nTRAINER.
Ow!
Our LEADER, BLAINE, became lost\nin the mountains but good.\cNight fell when a fiery bird\nPOKéMON appeared.\cIts light allowed BLAINE to find\nhis way down safely.
I've been to many GYMS, but this\none best suits my style.
Yowza!\nToo hot!
PONYTA, NINETALES…\nThose are popular FIRE POKéMON.
Fire is weak against H2O.
Oh!\nSnuffed out!
Water beats fire, of course.\cBut fire melts ice, so the FIRE\ntype beats ICE-type POKéMON.
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cThe hotheaded BLAINE is a FIRE\nPOKéMON pro.\cDouse his spirits with water!\cYou'd better take some\nBURN HEALS, too.
[PLAYER]!\nYou beat that firebrand!

POKéMON Quiz!\cGet it right, and the door opens to\nthe next room.\cGet it wrong, and face a TRAINER!\cIf you want to conserve your\nPOKéMON for the GYM LEADER…\cThen get it right!\nHere we go!
CATERPIE evolves into METAPOD?
There are nine certified POKéMON\nLEAGUE BADGES?
POLIWAG evolves three times?
Are electric moves effective\nagainst GROUND-type POKéMON?
POKéMON of the same kind and level\nare not identical?
TM28 contains TOMBSTONY?
You're absolutely correct!\cGo on through!
Sorry!\nBad call!
It's a photo of BLAINE and\nMR. FUJI.\cThey're standing shoulder to\nshoulder with big grins.
We study POKéMON extensively\nevery day.\cPeople often bring us rare POKéMON\nfor examination.
A photo of the LAB's founder…\nDR. FUJI?!

POKéMON LAB\nTesting Room
I found this most remarkable fossil\ninside MT. MOON.\cI think it's of a rare, prehistoric\nPOKéMON.
EEVEE can evolve into one of three\nkinds of POKéMON.
There's an e-mail message.\c… … …\cThere are three legendary bird\nPOKéMON.\cThey are ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and\nMOLTRES.\cTheir whereabouts are unknown.\cWe plan to explore the cavern\nclose to CERULEAN.\cFrom: POKéMON RESEARCH TEAM…
An amber pipe!
Tch-tch-tch!\nI'll teach you a nifty move.\cTeach it to a POKéMON, and watch\nthe fun unfold!\cIt's a move called METRONOME.\nDoes it strike your fancy?
I tell you, it's a lot of fun!
Okay!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?
Tch-tch-tch!\nThat's the sound of a METRONOME.\cIt tweaks your POKéMON's brain into\nusing moves it doesn't even know.
Hiya!\cI am important doctor.\nYes, very much so, indeed.\cHere, I study rare POKéMON fossils.\nAll the time, I study.\cYou!\nHave you a fossil for me?
No!\nIs too bad!
ちょっと　じかん　かかるよ！\cそこらへんを　すこし\nブラブラ　してくると　よろしー！
You late.\nWhere were you?\cYour fossil is back to life!\nIt was [STR_VAR_1] like I think!
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_1]\nfrom the doctor.
ポケモン　いっぱいで　もてないね！
Oh!\nThat is [STR_VAR_2], it is!\cIt is fossil of [STR_VAR_1],\na POKéMON that is already extinct!\cMy Resurrection Machine will make\nthat POKéMON live again!
So!\nYou hurry and give me that!\c[FONT_NORMAL][PLAYER] handed over the\n[STR_VAR_2] to the weird doctor.
I take a little time!\nYou go for walk a little while!
Aiyah!\nYou come again!
I came to visit the CINNABAR GYM,\nbut the door is locked tight.\cThere should be a key for it\nsomewhere.\cCould it be in that burned-out\nmansion?\cThe GYM LEADER's friend used to\nlive there, they say.
Do you have lots of friends?\cLinking up with the usual friends\nis fun, of course.\cBut how about visiting the\nUNION ROOM every so often?\cWho knows, you may end up making\nnew friends.\cI think it would be worth your time\nto check the UNION ROOM.
POKéMON can still learn techniques\nafter canceling evolution.\cEvolution can wait until new moves\nhave been learned.
BILL: Hey, you kept me waiting!\nReady to set sail to ONE ISLAND?
Oh, you're still not done yet?
Well, that's it.\nLet's go!
Don't they have X ATTACK?\cI like it because it raises the\nATTACK stat in battle.
It never hurts to have extra items.\nYou never know what might happen.
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cAt the POKéMON LEAGUE, you will\nface the ELITE FOUR all in a row.\cIf you lose, you have to start all\nover again!\cThis is it!\nGo for it!
From here on, you face the\nELITE FOUR one by one.\cIf you win, a door opens to the\nnext TRAINER. Good luck!
I am so sorry, but you've wasted\nyour time coming here.\cLORELEI of the ELITE FOUR is\nabsent, you see.\cAs a result, the POKéMON LEAGUE is\nclosed for the time being.
AGATHA's GHOST-type POKéMON are\nhorrifically terrifying in toughness.\cI took my FIGHTING-type POKéMON\nand raised them to the max.\cI went at AGATHA feeling pretty\nconfident, but she whupped us.\cThat old lady's also got a really\nshort fuse, too.\cIt doesn't take anything to get\nthat scary lady hollering.
Maybe becoming an ELITE FOUR\nmember is in the blood.\cFrom what I've heard, LANCE has\na cousin who's a GYM LEADER\rsomewhere far away.
My daughter is so self-centered.\nShe has but a few friends.
My daughter likes to mimic people.\nIt's rather vexing.\cHer mimicry has earned her the\nnickname COPYCAT around here.
CHANSEY: Chaan! Sii!
[PLAYER]: Hi!\nDo you like POKéMON?\c[PLAYER]: Uh, no, I just asked you.\c[PLAYER]: Huh?\nYou're strange!\cCOPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking?\nBut, that's my favorite hobby!
[PLAYER]: Hi.\nYou must like POKéMON.\c[PLAYER]: No, not me.\nI asked you.\c[PLAYER]: Pardon?\nYou're weird!\r \rCOPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking?\rBut that's my favorite hobby!
Oh wow!\nA POKé DOLL!\cFor me?\nThank you!\cYou know what?\nI can teach the move MIMIC.
Don't you like MIMIC?
I really love MIMIC!\nWho's going to learn it?
[PLAYER]: Hi!\nThanks for earlier!\c[PLAYER]: Pardon?\c[PLAYER]: Is it that fun to mimic my\nevery move?\cCOPYCAT: You bet!\nIt's a scream!
[PLAYER]: Hi!\nThanks for what you did for us.\c[PLAYER]: Pardon?\c[PLAYER]: Is it really that fun to\ncopy what I say and do?\cCOPYCAT: You bet!\nIt's a scream!

？　みえないぞ…
Grunt!\cI am the KARATE MASTER!\nI am the LEADER here!\cYou wish to challenge us?\nExpect no mercy!\cFwaaa!
Hwa!\nArrgh! Beaten!
Indeed, I have lost!\cBut, I beseech you, do not take\nour emblem as your trophy!\cIn return, I will give you a prized\nFIGHTING POKéMON!\cChoose whichever one you like!
Grunt!\nStay and train at karate with us!
Hoargh!\nTake your shoes off!
I give up!
You wait 'til you see our MASTER!\nI'm a small fry compared to him!
I hear you're good!\nShow me!
Judge!\nOne point!
Our MASTER is a pro fighter.\nBe prepared to lose!
Hiyah!\nI have no fear for anything tough!\cI shatter boulders for training\nevery day!
Yow!\nStubbed fingers!
The only thing that frightens us is\npsychic power!
Hwaah!\cYou're trespassing in our\nFIGHTING DOJO!
Oof!\nI give up!
The prime fighters across the land\ntrain here.
You want the hard-kicking\nHITMONLEE?
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_1]\nfrom the KARATE MASTER.
You want the piston-punching\nHITMONCHAN?
[PLAYER]は　カラテ　だいおう　から\n[STR_VAR_1]を　もらった！
Better not get greedy…
Enemies on every side!
What goes around comes around.
FIGHTING DOJO
I had a vision of your arrival.\cI have had psychic powers since\nI was a child.\cIt started when a spoon I\ncarelessly tossed, bent.\cI dislike battling, but if you wish,\nI will show you my powers![PLAY_BGM MUS_ENCOUNTER_GYM_LEADER]
This loss shocks me!\nBut, a loss is a loss.\cI admit, I didn't work hard enough\nto win.\cYour victory has earned you the\nMARSHBADGE.
Psychic power isn't something that\nonly a few people have.\cEveryone has psychic power.\nPeople just don't realize it.
The MARSHBADGE makes POKéMON up\nto Lv. 70 obey you.\cStronger POKéMON will become wild,\nignoring your orders in battle.\cJust don't raise your POKéMON too\nmuch to avoid that problem.\cWait, please take this TM with you.
[PLAYER] received TM04 from\nSABRINA.
TM04 is CALM MIND.\cIt makes the POKéMON concentrate\nto raise both SP. ATK and SP. DEF.
Your BAG is full of other items.
SABRINA is far younger than I,\nbut she has earned my respect.
Not good enough!
In a battle of equals, the one\nwith the stronger will wins.\cIf you wish to beat SABRINA, focus\nand will yourself to victory.
Does our unseen power scare you?
I never foresaw this!
PSYCHIC POKéMON fear only ghosts\nand bugs!
POKéMON take on the appearance of\ntheir TRAINERS.\cYour POKéMON must be tough, then!
I knew it!
I have much to learn still…\cI must master PSYCHIC and teach it\nto my POKéMON…
You understand, don't you?\cThat power alone isn't enough to\nwin in the world of POKéMON?
I don't believe this!
SABRINA just wiped out the KARATE\nMASTER next door.
You and I, our POKéMON shall\nbattle!
I lost after all!
I knew that this was going to take\nplace.
SABRINA is young, but she's also\nour highly skilled LEADER.\cYou won't reach her easily!
Ow!\nDown and out!
There used to be two POKéMON GYMS\nin SAFFRON.\cThe FIGHTING DOJO next door lost\nits GYM status, though.\cWe simply creamed them when we\ndecided to have just one GYM.
SAFFRON POKéMON GYM is famous for\ntraining psychics.\cYou want to see SABRINA, don't\nyou? I can tell!
Arrrgh!
That's right! I used telepathy to\nread your mind!
Yo!\nChamp in the making!\cSABRINA's POKéMON use psychic\npower instead of force.\cFIGHTING POKéMON are especially\nweak against PSYCHIC POKéMON.\cThey'll get destroyed before they\ncan even aim a punch!
Psychic power, huh?\cIf I had that, I'd make a bundle\nat the slots!

…Thank you for writing.\nI hope to see you soon!\c…Hey!\nDon't look at my letter!
PIDGEY: Kurukkoo!
The COPYCAT is cute!\nI'm getting her a POKé DOLL.
I was given a PP UP as a gift.\cIt's used to increase the PP of\na POKéMON's move.\cI should use it on a powerful move\nwith only a few PP.
MAX REPEL keeps weaker POKéMON\nfrom appearing.\cMAX REPEL stays effective longer\nthan SUPER REPEL.
REVIVE is costly, but it revives\nfainted POKéMON!
POKéMON growth rates differ from\nspecies to species.
SILPH CO. is widely known to all.\cIt's a victim of its own fame - it\nattracted TEAM ROCKET.
Sigh…\nWouldn't this be great?\cIf the ELITE FOUR came and\nstomped TEAM ROCKET?
TEAM ROCKET took off!\nWe can go out safely again!\rThat's great!
…Wait! Don't say a word!\cYou wanted this!
[PLAYER] received TM29\nfrom MR. PSYCHIC.
You already know, don't you?\nTM29 is PSYCHIC.\cIt's an attack that may also lower\nthe target's special stats.
Where do you plan to put this?\nYou've no room.
Huh?\nYou…
Are you maybe…\n… …\cYou are!\nYou are [PLAYER]!\cWe were just talking about you!\cWe were talking about how an\nincredibly good TRAINER appeared.\cAnd that someone is you!\nYou're so cool!\cSo, we decided that we'll become\nyour FAN CLUB!\cWe all hope you'll keep battling\nand show us how cool you are.\cThat way, maybe other people will\nbecome fans just like me.
I'll always be cheering for you!\cGo, [PLAYER], go!
I'll always believe in you,\n[PLAYER].\cPlease show the others what you're\nlike when you battle seriously.
I'm sorry.\nI was your fan before.\cBut now, you seem to have lost\nthe drive you had before.\cLately, I think [STR_VAR_1] has been\na lot cooler.
Oh!\n[PLAYER]!\cEveryone's been all excited about\nyou recently.\cI can understand why.\nI know that you're strong.\cBut, do you know what?\cOnce I became [STR_VAR_1]'s fan,\nI can't just stop being a fan.
I think TRAINERS are so cool when\nthey're battling.\cDon't you think so, too?
Oh! It's [PLAYER]!\nToo cool!\cOh!\nOh, yeah!\cCan you autograph something?\nHow about my shorts?
However hot it's been…\cAnd however cold it may get…\cI've always believed in, and worn,\nshorts!\cI'm counting on you to keep\nwinning!\cI believe in you just as much as\nI believe in shorts!
BROCK's my hero!\nHe's a man among men!\cHeheh, I got my mom to do\nsomething for me.\cI got her to embroider “BROCK”\non my shorts!
…  …\c…  …\nI'm BROCK's fan!\cEven if I were his only fan,\nI swear it on my rock-hard will,\rand on my shorts!\cI'll be his fan to the bitter end!
BROCK's the last word on cool,\nend of story!\cNow there's a guy who I want to\nbe like!
[PLAYER], I've had the pleasure of\nwatching you battle.\cIt brings back sweet memories of\nmy own long-lost youth.\cMay you continue to find success.\nYou have a fan in me!
I have journeyed far and wide\nacross the lands.\cBut never have I seen a TRAINER\nof your magnificence.\cTake courage in your abilities\nand keep battling on!\cMake that a promise to me,\nmy young idol!
Hmm…\nAnd you are?\cWere you hoping to sign up for\na membership in our FAN CLUB?
Ah, so you are the much-\ntalked-about [PLAYER].\cYou certainly do have the look of\na winner.\cBut for me to accept you as\na true POKéMON great…\c… …\cYou've still a ways to go!
All of us gathered here are fans\nof POKéMON TRAINERS.\cThe way they look in battle…\nThey are the picture of coolness.\cPerhaps you will be talked about\nhere, too, if you keep winning.
It's [PLAYER]!\nIt's [PLAYER]!\cI want to be like [PLAYER] one day!
Everyone stopped being [PLAYER]'s\nfan…\cBut that means I can have [PLAYER]\nall to myself!\cYay! Go for it!\nMy one and only [PLAYER]!
Do you know what?\nI want to be like SABRINA!\cI want to be a psychic girl just\nlike her!
Even if I'm the only one, I won't\nstop being SABRINA's fan.\cMy dream is to be like SABRINA,\ncute, but cool.\cI want to be a psychic girl just\nlike her!
I wonder if I can become a cool\nTRAINER one day?
Oh, man, oh, man!\nCool! Too cool!\c…Huh?\nNo, not you.\cJust the way you battle.\nThat's cool.
Yo, [PLAYER]!\cLooks like I'm the only one left\nout of your fans.\cBut, you know, I like being an only\nfan… It's less stressful.\cKeep up and at it!
[STR_VAR_1]'s cool, huh?\nI love the way he talks.\cI'd really relish a chance to meet\nhim in person once.
Huh, can you believe it?\nEveryone turned into your fans.\cSo after all we've been through,\nI'm the lone [STR_VAR_1] fan?\cEh, being the one and only\n[STR_VAR_1] fan's my style, anyway.
Oh, my goodness!\nIs it really you, [PLAYER]?\cI have to tell you, I adore the\nway you battle.\cI hope you'll keep at it.\nI'll be your number one fan!
Oh, my goodness!\nIf it isn't [PLAYER]!\cIt's so disappointing… I realized\nI'm your number-one-and-only fan!\cWell, it can't be helped!\nLet me cheer you on, at least!\cHurray, hurray, [PLAYER]!
Recently, [STR_VAR_1] has been on\nfire.\cThe way he battles… It's just \nthe way that I like it!
Oh, hello!\nIf it isn't [PLAYER]!\cLately, all everyone talks about\nis you.\cI'm feeling lonesome because I\nprefer [STR_VAR_1].
Amazing!\n[PLAYER], you really are amazing!\cInstead of just watching, maybe\nI should become a TRAINER, too.
I'm your only fan…\nSigh… This is lonely…\cCan't you try harder and make the\nothers take notice of you?
Master [STR_VAR_1] is so dignified…\nHe is so my type.\cWhy can't the others see the\ndignity he simply oozes?
I believe in Master [STR_VAR_1]\nwith all my heart.\cEven if I am the only one to\nbelieve in him.\cI won't ever feel lonesome, though.\cNot if I keep thinking about Master\n[STR_VAR_1].
Hiyah!\cYour battling style is most\neducational.\cI hope that you will keep plugging\naway at success, hiyah!
Instead of just watching others\nbattle, battle yourself!\c…My DOJO's MASTER chewed me out\nlike that…\cBut I won't let that stop me from\nbeing your fan!\cI can't stop being your fan!
Hiyah! There is but one TRAINER\nwho has my respect.\cAnd that is none other than my\nMASTER at the FIGHTING DOJO.\cYou should become a fan of my\nMASTER like me! Hiyah!
Hiyah! I respect my MASTER at the\nFIGHTING DOJO.\cI will never become a fan of\nanyone other than my MASTER!\cI will even sneak out of the DOJO\nto spread word of his greatness.\cHiyah!
Are you going to VIRIDIAN FOREST?\nIt's a natural maze in there.\rBe careful you don't get lost.
RATTATA may be small, but don't\nunderestimate its wicked bite.\cHave you caught one already?
A fainted POKéMON just has no\nenergy left to battle.\cIt can still use moves like CUT\noutside of battle.
Hi! Remember me?\nI'm one of PROF. OAK's AIDES.\cIf your POKéDEX has complete data\non ten species, I'm supposed to\rgive you a reward.\cPROF. OAK entrusted me with\nHM05 for you.\cSo, [PLAYER], let me ask you.\cHave you gathered data on at least\nten kinds of POKéMON?
Great! You have caught or owned\n[STR_VAR_3] kinds of POKéMON!\cCongratulations!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] received HM05\nfrom the AIDE.
HM05 contains the hidden move\nFLASH.\cFLASH lights up even the darkest\nof caves and dungeons.
Once a POKéMON learns FLASH, you\ncan get through ROCK TUNNEL.
Many POKéMON live only in forests \nand caves.\cYou need to be persistent and look\neverywhere to get different kinds.
Have you noticed the skinny trees\non the roadside?\cThey can be cut down by a special\nPOKéMON move, I hear.
Do you know the evolution-cancel\ntechnique?\cWhen a POKéMON is evolving, you\ncan stop the process.\cIt's a technique for raising\nPOKéMON the way they are.
Okay, set six POKé BALLS in my\nbelt…\cYeah, that'll do it. At most, you\ncan have six POKéMON with you.
TEAM ROCKET attacks CERULEAN\ncitizens…\cNot a day goes by without TEAM\nROCKET being in the news.
MAN: Hello there, laddie!\nHave I got a deal just for you!\cI'll let you have a secret POKéMON\n- a MAGIKARP - for just $500!\cSo, you'll buy it, am I right?
MAN: Hello there, sweetie pie!\nHave I got a deal just for you!\cI'll let you have a secret POKéMON\n- a MAGIKARP - for just $500!\cSo, you'll buy it, am I right?
[PLAYER] paid an outrageous $500\nand bought the MAGIKARP…
No? You say no? I'm only doing this\nas a favor to you!
There's no more room for any more\nPOKéMON, it looks like.
You'll need more money than that!
MAN: Well, I don't give refunds.\nYou knew what you were getting!
Sometimes, you'll have too many\nPOKéMON with you to add any more.\cIn that case, you should just\nstore some using any PC.
It's a newspaper.
I run the DAY-CARE service.\cWould you like me to raise one of\nyour POKéMON?
Come again.
Which POKéMON should I raise?
Fine.\nCome anytime you like.
Fine, I'll look after your\n[STR_VAR_1] for a while.
Come see me in a while.
You're back already?\cYour [STR_VAR_1] needs to spend\nsome more time with me.
You owe me $[STR_VAR_2] for the return\nof this POKéMON.
Thank you!\nHere's your POKéMON.
[PLAYER] got [STR_VAR_1] back\nfrom the DAY-CARE MAN.
Oh? You only have one POKéMON\nwith you.
If you leave me that POKéMON,\nwhat will you battle with?
Your [STR_VAR_1] has grown a lot.\nYes, quite a lot, I'd say.\cLet me see…\nBy level, it's grown by [STR_VAR_2].\cAren't I great?
You can't take this POKéMON back\nif you've got no room for it.
You don't have enough money.

Huh? I can have this drink?\nGee, thanks!\r… …\rGlug, glug…\r… …\rGulp…\rIf you want to go to SAFFRON\rCITY…\r… …\rYou can go on through.\cI'll share this TEA with the other\nguards!
Hi, how's it going?
The types of POKéMON match up\ndifferently with each other.\cEvery type is stronger than some\ntypes and weaker than others.
A NUGGET is totally useless.\nSo I sold it for $5000.
I heard that ghosts haunt\nLAVENDER TOWN.
Oh… [PLAYER]!\nI've been looking for you!\cIt's me, one of the ever-present\nAIDES to PROF. OAK.\cIf your POKéDEX has complete data\non twenty species, I'm supposed to\rgive you a reward from PROF. OAK.\cHe entrusted me with this\nEVERSTONE.\cSo, [PLAYER], let me ask you.\cHave you gathered data on at least\ntwenty kinds of POKéMON?
Great! You have caught or owned\n[STR_VAR_3] kinds of POKéMON!\cCongratulations!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] received the EVERSTONE\nfrom the AIDE.
Making POKéMON evolve certainly\ncan add to the POKéDEX.\cHowever, at times, you may not\nwant a certain POKéMON to evolve.\cIn that case, give the EVERSTONE\nto that POKéMON.\cIt will prevent evolution according\nto the PROFESSOR.
[PLAYER][KUN]の　バッグ\nいっぱい　みたい　だね
Don't you think it's hard to think\nup good names for POKéMON?\cEspecially if you've caught a\nwhole bunch?\cIn LAVENDER TOWN, there's a man\nwho rates POKéMON nicknames.\cHe can even help you rename your\nPOKéMON, too.
If you're aiming to reach LAVENDER\nTOWN, take ROCK TUNNEL.\cYou can get to ROCK TUNNEL from\nCERULEAN CITY.
Hi! Remember me?\nI'm one of PROF. OAK's AIDES.\cIf your POKéDEX has complete data\non [STR_VAR_1] species, I'm supposed to\rgive you a reward.\cPROF. OAK entrusted me with the\n[STR_VAR_2] for you.\cSo, [PLAYER], let me ask you.\cHave you gathered data on at least\n[STR_VAR_1] kinds of POKéMON?
Great! You have caught or owned\n[STR_VAR_3] kinds of POKéMON!\cCongratulations!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_2]\nfrom the AIDE.
There are items on the ground that\nmay be hidden from view.\cUse the ITEMFINDER to detect any\nhidden items close to you.\cThe machine is a bit limited.\nIt can't pinpoint item locations.\cWhat it does is show the direction\nwhere the item is.\cUse it to get your bearings, then\nsearch the suspect area by hand.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cA big POKéMON is asleep on a road!
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cWhat a breathtaking view!
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cTo get to LAVENDER TOWN from\nCERULEAN CITY…\cROCK TUNNEL appears to be a good\nroute to take.
There's a lookout spot upstairs.\nThe view is magnificent.
My POKéMON's ashes are stored in\nPOKéMON TOWER.\cYou can have this TM.\nI don't need it anymore…
My POKéMON's ashes are stored in\nPOKéMON TOWER.\cYou can have this TM.\nI don't need it anymore…
[PLAYER] received TM27\nfrom the little girl.
TM27 is a move called RETURN…\cIf you treat your POKéMON good,\nit will return your love by working\rits hardest in battle.
You don't have room for this.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cThere's a man fishing!
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cIt's POKéMON TOWER!
I'm the FISHING GURU's younger\nbrother.\cI simply looove fishing!\nI can't bear to go without.\cTell me, do you like to fish?
Grand! I like your style.\nI think we can be friends.\cTake this and fish, young friend!
[PLAYER] received a SUPER ROD from\nthe FISHING GURU's brother.
Fishing is a way of life!\nIt is like the finest poetry.\cFrom the seas to rivers, go out\nand land the big one, my friend.\cNow, I have a request.\cIf you catch a big MAGIKARP \nwith that ROD, I want to see it.\cAs much as I love to fish, I also\nlove seeing gigantic MAGIKARP.
Oh…\nThat's so disappointing…
Hello there, [PLAYER]!\nHave you been fishing?\cTry fishing with the SUPER ROD in\nany body of water.\cYou'll find different POKéMON in\ndifferent places.\cOh, and don't forget to bring me\ngigantic MAGIKARP.
Oh? [PLAYER]?\nWhy, if it isn't a MAGIKARP!\cAllow me to see it, quick!
… … …Whoa!\n[STR_VAR_2] inches!\cYou have a rare appreciation for\nthe fine, poetic aspects of fishing!\cYou must take this.\nI insist!
I'll look forward to seeing greater\nrecords from you!
Huh?\n[STR_VAR_2] inches?\cThis is the same size as the one\nI saw before.
Hmm…\nThis one is [STR_VAR_2] inches long.\cIt doesn't measure up to the\n[STR_VAR_3]-inch one you brought before.
Uh… That doesn't look much like\na MAGIKARP.
Oh, no!\cI had a gift for you, but you have\nno room for it.
The most gigantic MAGIKARP\nI have ever witnessed…\c[STR_VAR_3] inches!
It's a blank chart of some sort.\cIt has spaces for writing in\nrecords of some kind.
Are you the kid who's working on\na POKéDEX?\cPROF. OAK's AIDE came by here.
Hi! Remember me?\nI'm one of PROF. OAK's AIDES.\cIf your POKéDEX has complete data\non [STR_VAR_1] species, I'm supposed to\rgive you a reward.\cPROF. OAK entrusted me with the\n[STR_VAR_2] for you.\cSo, [PLAYER], let me ask you.\cHave you gathered data on at least\n[STR_VAR_1] kinds of POKéMON?
Great! You have caught or owned\n[STR_VAR_3] kinds of POKéMON!\cCongratulations!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] received the [STR_VAR_2]\nfrom the AIDE.
EXP. SHARE is an item to be held\nby a POKéMON.\cThe POKéMON will receive a share\nof the EXP. Points without having\rto battle.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cA large, shining bird is flying\ntoward the sea.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cIt looks like a small island on\nthe horizon!
Oh, dear.\nYou've found my secret retreat.\cPlease don't tell anyone I'm here.\nI'll make it up to you with this!
[PLAYER] received HM02\nfrom the girl.
HM02 is FLY.\nIt's a wonderfully convenient move.\cPlease, put it to good use.
You don't have any room for this.
FEAROW: Kyueen!
No pedestrians are allowed on\nCYCLING ROAD!
CYCLING ROAD is a downhill course\nby the sea. It's a great ride.
Excuse me!\nWait up, please!
How'd you get in?\nGood effort!
I'm on a relaxing ride on my new\nbike with my girlfriend.
We're going riding together on our\nnew bikes.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cIt's the CELADON DEPT. STORE!
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cThere's a long path over water far\naway.
Hi! Remember me?\nI'm one of PROF. OAK's AIDES.\cIf your POKéDEX has complete data\non 40 species, I'm supposed to\rgive you a reward.\cPROF. OAK entrusted me with an\nAMULET COIN for you.\cSo, [PLAYER], let me ask you.\cHave you gathered data on at least\n40 kinds of POKéMON?
Great! You have caught or owned\n[STR_VAR_3] kinds of POKéMON!\cCongratulations!\nHere you go!
[PLAYER] received the AMULET COIN\nfrom the AIDE.
An AMULET COIN is an item to be\nheld by a POKéMON.\cIf the POKéMON appears in a winning\nbattle, you will earn more money.
You need a BICYCLE to go out on\nCYCLING ROAD!
CYCLING ROAD is all uphill from\nhere.
Excuse me!
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cPALLET TOWN is in the west.
Let's see what the binoculars have\nto show…\cThere are people swimming.
Hiya! I'm a POKéMON…\n…No I'm not!\cCall me BILL!\nI'm a true-blue POKéMANIAC!\cHey!\nWhat's with that skeptical look?\cI'm not joshing you, pal.\cI screwed up an experiment and got\ncombined with a POKéMON!\cSo, how about it?\nHelp me out here!
Hiya! I'm a POKéMON…\n…No I'm not!\cCall me BILL!\nI'm a true-blue POKéMANIAC!\cHey!\nWhat's with that skeptical look?\cI'm not joshing you, lady.\cI screwed up an experiment and got\ncombined with a POKéMON!\cSo, how about it?\nHelp me out here!
Wait till I get inside the\nTELEPORTER.\cWhen I do, go to my PC and run\nthe Cell Separation System.
No!?\nNow don't be so cold!\cCome on, you gotta help a guy in\ndeep, deep trouble!\cWhat do you say, chief?\nPlease?\rOkay?\rAll right!
No!?\nNow don't be so cold!\cCome on, you gotta help a guy in\ndeep, deep trouble!\cWhat do you say, beautiful?\nPlease?\rOkay?\rAll right!
BILL: Yeehah!\nThanks, bud! I owe you one!\cSo, did you come to see my\nPOKéMON collection?\cYou didn't?\nThat's a bummer.\cI've got to thank you…\nOh, here, maybe this'll do.
BILL: Yeehah!\nThanks, lady! I owe you one!\cSo, did you come to see my\nPOKéMON collection?\cYou didn't?\nThat's a bummer.\cI've got to thank you…\nOh, here, maybe this'll do.
[PLAYER] received an S.S. TICKET\nfrom BILL.
You've got too much stuff!
That cruise ship S.S. ANNE is in\nVERMILION CITY.\cI hear there are lots of TRAINERS\non board, too.\cThey invited me to their party, but\nI can't stand fancy do's.\cWhy don't you go instead of me?\nGo on and have a good time.
BILL: Feel like checking out some\nof my rare POKéMON on my PC?\cGo on, check out my PC.
TELEPORTER is displayed on the PC\nmonitor.
[PLAYER] initiated the TELEPORTER's\nCell Separator.
BILL's favorite POKéMON list!
Which POKéMON do you want to see?
I may not look like much now,\nbut when I was younger…\cI flew everywhere, challenging\nTRAINERS wherever I found them.\cNow, my only source of enjoyment\nis reminiscing about the past while\rwatching battles.
There is a slight breeze blowing\naround the box.
Ah!\nWelcome, my friend!\cLet me tell you something. There's\na hidden room in the basement.\cA TRAINER named [STR_VAR_1] is\nwaiting there now.\cTell me, you did come to challenge\n[STR_VAR_1], am I right?
Oh…\nYou won't battle…\cI see, I see.\n… …\cWell, perhaps if you change your\nmind, do come back.
Ah!\nYou will battle for me?\cIt was worth my time moving the\nbox aside, then.\c… …\nBut there is one slight problem.\cThis hidden room is not built very\nsturdy.\cCan I get you to limit it to\nbattles of three POKéMON per side?
Fine! Before your battle, would\nyou like to save your game?
All right.\nDon't hold anything back!
[STR_VAR_1]
The match ended up a draw.
A draw, was it?\cHowever, let me say that it was\na worthy spectacle.\cI'd say it was a wonderful battle\nwith a real sense of depth!
[STR_VAR_1]
Bravo!\cBravo, indeed!\nWhat an astounding battle!\cIt was so astounding, why, it keeps\nfilling my eyes with tears!\cThe thrust and parry of expertly\nused techniques!\cThe clash of power upon power!\cYes!\nIt was sheer magnificence!
[STR_VAR_1]
Too bad!\nI feel your disappointment.\cHowever, that disappointment is\nwhat will make you better.\cUse it, learn from it, and make it\nmotivate you to seek greatness.\cForget not this disappointment\nand redouble your training!
POKéMON have personalities of their\nown, just like people.\cMy PIKACHU has a HASTY nature,\nso it grew to be a speedy POKéMON.
Okay, preparations are complete\nfor me to explore the RUINS.
I need to fish on SEVEN ISLAND.\cThat will complete my fishing tour\nof the SEVII ISLANDS.\cI'd better stock up on some\nPOKé BALLS first, though.
On this island, different events\noccur depending on connections.\cWhat are those connections?\cThey are for you to discover on\nyour own.
Did you ride a SEAGALLOP ferry\nto get here?\cThere are at least ten of those\nhigh-speed ships.\cI don't know where they all go,\nthough.
If you're confident, you should\ncheck out TRAINER TOWER.
BILL: Hey, there!\nCELIO!
CELIO: BILL!\nI can't believe you came out here.
BILL: Well, absolutely!\nHow's your research coming along?\c…Oh, wait a sec.
[PLAYER], this is my buddy CELIO.\nHe's one dedicated PC MANIAC!
CELIO, this is [PLAYER], a rising\ncontender as the POKéMON CHAMP!
CELIO, this is [PLAYER], the\nreigning POKéMON CHAMP!
CELIO: That's really impressive.\cI hate to say it, but I have zero\naptitude for battling.\cAnyways, I'm glad to meet you.
BILL: So, bring me up to speed.\nHow's your machine running?
CELIO: It's running fine, but we're\ntoo remote out here.\cThe PCs on this island just can't\nlink with your PC, BILL.
BILL: Oh, yeah?\nOkay, let me take a look-see.\c…Hang on here…\nI think we can make it work.\rLet me help you, okay?
[PLAYER], can I get you to wait for\nme just a bit?\c…Actually, can I get you to do\nme a favor?\cThe island next to this one's\ncalled TWO ISLAND.\cThere's a guy there that runs\na GAME CORNER.\cHe has this thing for rare rocks\nand gems.\cWe keep in touch, being fellow\nmaniacs.\cSo, can I get you to deliver this\nMETEORITE to him?
[PLAYER] accepted the METEORITE\nfrom BILL.
CELIO: [PLAYER], if you are going\nto TWO ISLAND, please take this.
It's a PASS for the ferry service\nserving the local islands.\cIt will let you travel between the\nISLANDS ONE, TWO, and THREE.\cOh, you should have this, too.
[PLAYER] received an extra page\nfor the TOWN MAP!
[PLAYER] received\na TOWN MAP!
BILL: I'll catch you later!\nSay hi to the guy for me!
Hmm…\cHow about we try this like this…
Oh, hey, [PLAYER]!\cDid you see?\nWe got the PC working!\cI've got a few things to show\nCELIO here.\cCan you go out on a stroll or\nsomething for a while more?
I'm sorry for taking up so much of\nBILL's time.\cI'm also sorry for being such a \npoor host on your visit here.
The usual PC services aren't\navailable…
BILL: Oh, hey!\n[PLAYER]!
BILL: What kept you so long?\nBeen out having a good time?\cWe got it done.\nThe PCs are up and running!
CELIO: The job went incredibly\nquick.\cBILL is one amazing guy…
BILL: No, no! There was almost\nnothing left for me to do.\cCELIO, I have to hand it to you.\nYou've learned a lot.
CELIO: Oh, really?\nEhehe…
BILL: Well, there you have it.\nI'm finished with the job.\rWe should head back to KANTO.\cCELIO, I'll be seeing you again.
CELIO: [PLAYER], I'm really sorry\nthat we sent you off alone today.\cI promise, I will show you around\nthese islands sometime.
CELIO: Hello!\nYou look awfully busy as always.\cHow am I doing?\cWell, I'm modifying my Network\nMachine.\cWhen I get done with the machine,\nI hope you'll be first to use it,\r[PLAYER].
CELIO: [PLAYER], how have things\nbeen for you?\cOh, is that right?\nYou've caught more POKéMON.\cDo you know what?\nMaybe I can be useful to you.
I'm modifying the Network Machine\nright now.\cI'm changing it so it can handle\ntrades over long distances.\cWhen I get finished, you'll be\ntrading for exotic POKéMON from\rTRAINERS far away.
But, there is a slight catch.\cFor the link to work, the Machine\nneeds a special gemstone.\cIt's supposed to be on ONE ISLAND,\nbut I haven't found one yet.\cWho knows where it could be.
I was trying to find the gem\neven while I was studying.\cAs a result, I've made no headway\nin both my search and studies…\cIf I relied on BILL, I'm sure my\nresearch would progress.\cBut this time, I want to try to do\nthings by myself.
Oh!\nTh-that's…
[PLAYER] handed the RUBY\nto CELIO.
Thank you!\n[PLAYER], you're simply amazing.\c… … …  … … …\cUm… May I ask one more giant favor\nof you?
It… It's not anything weird.\nPlease, I need your help.
While I was studying gemstones,\nI discovered something important.\cThere is another gem that forms\na pair with this RUBY.\cThat other gemstone is supposed to\nbe in the SEVII ISLANDS.\c[PLAYER], please, I need you to go\nfind the other gem.\c[PLAYER], may I have your ferry\nPASS and the TOWN MAP?
[PLAYER] returned the TRI-PASS and\nreceived the RAINBOW PASS.
Obtained an extra page for the\nTOWN MAP!
This is my own ferry PASS.\cIt will let you get to all the\nSEVII ISLANDS.\c[PLAYER], please, I can't do\nit without your help.
[PLAYER] handed the SAPPHIRE\nto CELIO.
CELIO: So this is the gem that\nforms a pair with the RUBY…\c[PLAYER], you've gone through a lot\nto get this, didn't you?\cYou don't have to tell me. I know\nit wasn't easy.\cThank you so much!\cNow it's my turn to work for you!\nPlease give me a little time.
Okay, this is good…
I did it!\nI linked up with LANETTE!
[PLAYER]…\n[PLAYER], I did it!\cI've managed to link up with\nTRAINERS in the HOENN region!\cFinally, the Network Machine is\nfully operational!\c[PLAYER], I owe it all to you!\cThanks to you, my dream came\ntrue…
I…\nI'm not crying.\cThat's enough about me!\c[PLAYER], you're going to keep\nlooking for exotic POKéMON, right?\cI wish you the best of luck!
CELIO: Hello!\c[PLAYER], I've been hearing rumors\nabout you.
[PLAYER], what's your favorite kind\nof POKéMON?\cBILL is a POKéMANIAC, so he loves\nevery kind.\cApparently, the first one he caught\nwas an ABRA.
By the way, [PLAYER], you're from\nPALLET TOWN, aren't you?\cI've heard that it's a quiet and\npleasant place.\cBILL's hometown is GOLDENROD CITY,\nwhere his folks still live.\cI've heard that it's quite the\nfestive, bustling city.\cI'd like to go there one day.
[PLAYER], is there anything that\nyou can't stand?\cApparently, BILL simply can't\nstomach milk at all.
Oh, you're a stranger here!\nHi! Where did you come from?\c…PALLET TOWN?\nI don't know it!
On this island, there's an enormous\nvolcano.\cIt hasn't erupted lately, so why\nnot enjoy a hike?
I wish I could trade POKéMON with\nmy boyfriend who lives far away…
I traded POKéMON with my boyfriend\nfar away!\cEveryone's saying that we can\nthank you and CELIO.\cSo, thank you!
Network Machine\nLink Level 0\c…POKéMON Storage System under\nadjustment…
Network Machine\nLink Level 1\cLink established with the KANTO\nregion.
Network Machine\nLink Level 2\cLink established with the KANTO\nand HOENN regions.
Obtained the TRI-PASS!
On sunny days, I step out and gaze\nupon the volcano.\cThat's my daily routine.
Let me think… When was the last\ntime MT. EMBER erupted?
Young people all want to go off to\nbig cities.\cBut I want to stay here forever!
Now, where's LOSTELLE gotten to\ntoday?\cShe always brings me lunch every\nday right about now…
Hm? You, there!\nAre you a friend of LOSTELLE's?\cHave you seen LOSTELLE around?\nI don't know where she might be.\rShe should've been here long ago.\cLOSTELLE's a cutie - she got my\nlooks - so what if someone…\cWhat if something's happened to\nmy LOSTELLE?!\cPlease, help me find her!\nPlease go search THREE ISLAND!
Hah? What is this GAME CORNER?\nHow much sadder can this get?\cThose clowns…\cThey said they'd be waiting on the\nisland, so where are they?\cHey, you! Is this the only THREE\nISLAND around here?
Try waking up before you crawl out\nof bed, you punk.\cThis is TWO ISLAND!\cMove it! Get your filthy motorbike\nout of my place!
Huh…\nOh, oh, gotcha.\cTch…\nThese islands are confusing…
Would you look at that?\nThat punk scuffed up my floor.
Hey, but listen! I'm begging you,\nyou have to go to THREE ISLAND.\cIf anything were to happen to my\nLOSTELLE…\cMy place is the house with the red\nroof on THREE ISLAND.\cShe may just show up late here,\nso I can't run off anywhere.\cThat's why I have to get you to do\nme this big favor.
I'm sorry.\nWe're not running any games today.
We'll get the games going soon\nfor you!
So you rescued LOSTELLE?\nHow can I thank you?\cLOSTELLE, darling, forgive me!\cDaddy didn't know you were scared\nand in trouble!
LOSTELLE: It's okay, Daddy.\nI got to be friends with [PLAYER]!
Oh, what's that?\nYou're saying that this is for me?\cHow did you know that I love rare\nrocks and gems?\cYou sure know how to make a guy\nhappy.
[PLAYER] handed the METEORITE\nto LOSTELLE's daddy.
Oh, I see, this is from BILL!\nYou have to thank him for me!\cYou know, you've been fantastic.\nI want you to have this.
[PLAYER] received a MOON STONE\nfrom LOSTELLE's daddy.
Your BAG's not going to fit another\nthing…
All right, I'll get the GAME CORNER\nrunning right away.\cYou have to come visit with a\nfriend.
Listen, listen!\cPlease show me you being cool\nagain!
I'm the POKéMON MOVE MANIAC.\cI know every single move that\nPOKéMON learn growing up.\cI'm also a mushroom maniac.\cBring me two TINYMUSHROOMS,\nor one BIG MUSHROOM.\cIf you do that for me, I'll teach\na move to one POKéMON.
Sniff, sniff…\nHm! You smell of MUSHROOMS!\cDo you want me to teach a move\nto a POKéMON of yours?
Which POKéMON needs tutoring?
Which move should I teach?
Sorry…\cIt doesn't appear as if I have a\nmove I can teach that POKéMON.
Then, I'll need a MUSHROOM or two.\nWhat are you going to give me?
[PLAYER] handed over two\nTINYMUSHROOMS in exchange.
[PLAYER] handed over one\nBIG MUSHROOM in exchange.
If your POKéMON need to learn a\nmove, I need a MUSHROOM or two.
Hunh? There isn't a single move\nthat I can teach an EGG.
Have you visited the GAME CORNER\nalready?\cIt's no good to go alone.\nYou have to take a friend along.
Not many people live on\nTWO ISLAND.\cThere is this old lady who lives\nout on the cape.\cShe's been there since I don't know\nwhen.
LOSTELLE: Hi, [PLAYER]!\nYou're always so cool!\cI'll make lunch for you, too, one\nday, [PLAYER].
Rare rocks and gems are displayed.
Hey, did you hear the news?\cThe PC network here can now link\nwith PCs in KANTO.\cI don't know how that came about,\nbut it's fantastic!
It's impossible to SURF between the\nislands around these parts.\cThe tides are too fast and\ntreacherous.
Let's crush BERRIES!\n…That'd be wasting BERRIES?\cYou can always find some BERRIES\non the ground in BERRY FOREST.
Is it true?\cCELADON DEPT. STORE is several\ntimes bigger than this shop?
I sometimes buy medicine here.\cBut a lot of people heal POKéMON\nwith BERRIES from BERRY FOREST.\cAfter all, BERRIES are free and\nthey never run out.
Those BIKERS were about to trash\nthis POKéMON MART.\cAm I glad they decided to leave!
Urrrrrrrrgggghhhh…\nKwaaaaah!\c…It's useless! I can't make this\nspoon bend with my mind.\cMaybe I really don't have any\npsychic powers.
You know about a girl GYM LEADER\nin SAFFRON CITY?\cShe uses PSYCHIC-type POKéMON,\nright?\cI admire her, I really do.\cI've heard that she's one cool\ncustomer and beautiful, too.
I bought this house because I\nwanted to live somewhere quiet.\cToday, I think I'll go out fishing.
You must never, ever go out to\nthe BERRY FOREST alone.\cWhy?\nThere are ghosts there.
Papa keeps lying to me, and won't\nlet me go out and play!
Me?\nI'm not LOSTELLE.\cShe's probably gone to the\nBERRY FOREST, I think.\cShe picks BERRIES there for making\nlunch.
I think I'll go play with LOSTELLE\ntoday.
Ready?\nBoing!\cWe're having a BODY SLAM match\nto see who wimps out first.\cIf you were to join us, you'd be\nsquashed like a bug, though…\cHow about I teach BODY SLAM to\na POKéMON of yours instead?
Come again!\nBoing!
Which POKéMON wants to learn how\nto BODY SLAM?
Boioing!
それ　ぼよーん！\nおまえ　おもいなあー！
There's a rare kind of ICE POKéMON\nthat lives in the cave.\cWe get a lot of visitors hoping to\nsee that POKéMON.
Oh? A POKéMON EGG?\n…I have no idea.\c…Oh, wait. The DAY-CARE people\nin town were saying something.\cThey said that they'd found EGGS\nbefore on their property.
What's this?\cThe new POKéMON JOURNAL hasn't\narrived on this island?
そーれ　ぼよーん！\nどっちが　さきに　へたばるか？\rのしかかり　しょうぶ　してるんだ\cきみは　なかまに　はいったら\nつぶれそうだな…\rかわりに　きみの　ポケモンに\rのしかかり　おしえて　やろっか？
また　おいで　ぼよーん！
どの　ポケモンに\nおしえたい　かい？
ぼよよーん！
There! Boing!\nYou're awfully heavy!
LORELEI: There's something weighing\nheavily on my mind.\cIf anything were to happen on\nthe island where I was born…\cI wouldn't know about it if I were\nin the POKéMON LEAGUE.\cI wonder if that would make me\nirresponsible to my home…
LORELEI: So, you managed to solve\nall the problems here?\cThat's wonderful.\cThat means there isn't any reason\nfor me to be here all the time.\cThank you…\cI'll return to the POKéMON LEAGUE\nin a short while.
I don't know what will happen in\nthe future, but…\cI will do what I can here and now.\nThat's all I can do.
Stuffed POKéMON dolls galore!
We've had a great and powerful\nTRAINER grow up on this island.\cI bet even you'd know her.\nIt's LORELEI of the ELITE FOUR!\cWhen LORELEI was just a tyke,\nI taught her about POKéMON.
The SEVII ISLANDS are in a warm\nregion overall.\cBut there is one exception you\nneed to know about.\cThe ICEFALL CAVE is frigid because\nof the POKéMON that live in it.
I'm on my way to prepare a meal\nfor a certain high-society person.
You're on a quest to catch every\nsingle kind of POKéMON?\c…How incredible. Please tell me if\nyou catch a strong one!
こんばんの　おかずは\nようい　しなくて　いいぞ！\cって　だんなが\nつりに　いったん　だけど…\rしんじて　いいのかねえ
Don't worry about buying anything\nfor dinner tonight!\c…That's what my husband said when\nhe went off fishing today.\cI'm not sure if I can count on him\nto live up to that promise.
That MEADOW has belonged to our\nfamily for generations.\cI should have had a giant mansion\nbuilt on it.\cIt would be preferable to having\nthose thugs run wild on it!
For ten years, I've searched for\nRUINS.\cNo, make that twenty years.\cI get this feeling that there's\nsomething hidden on this island.
You know of POKéMON that evolve\nonly upon trading, yes?\cBut did you know that there are\nstill others?\cSome POKéMON evolve only when\ntraded while holding specific items.
[RIVAL]: Hey, [PLAYER]!\nHow's your POKéDEX filling up?\cIt looks like it's impossible to get\nall the POKéMON by hanging around\rjust these parts.\cMaybe there are POKéMON we don't\nknow about somewhere far away…\c… … …  … … …  … … …\cWell, if I can't do it, there's no\nway for you to get it done.\cI'm not going to get all desperate\nover this.\cI'll keep collecting POKéMON at my\nown pace while I train them.\cThat's what I'll do.\nSo there's no point staying here.\rI may as well leave for home.\cThat's that, then!\nSmell ya later!
There's nothing that young people'd\nfind exciting here on this island.\cBut, this is a good place in terms\nof nature and history.\cRelax and enjoy your stay.
Play with POKéMON lots and live\na long life!\cTake AGATHA, for example.\cShe set a record for being the\noldest-ever ELITE FOUR member.\cShe spurs me to do bigger things.
I should buy some MAIL and write\nhim a letter…
SELPHY: Oh?\nDo I know you from somewhere?\cOh, but that doesn't matter.\cI am exquisitely bored.\nPlease, hear my wish.
I wish to see a POKéMON.\nA darling [STR_VAR_1].\cI want to see one right away.\nPlease, make my wish come true.
SELPHY: Oh, I'm tired of this.\nI'm tired of waiting for you.\cI'll forgive you this time, but\nplease don't fail me next time.
SELPHY: Oh, hello, there.\cOh, my gracious. That must be the\n[STR_VAR_1] you caught for me.\cGiggle…\nI see a resemblance to you.\cThank you so kindly.\c… …  … …  … …\nIs something the matter?\cYou may leave.\c… …  … …  … …\nOh, fine. I understand now.\cSEBASTIAN!\nI need you here this instant!
Butler: Yes, my lady.
SELPHY: See to it that this person\nis given a token of appreciation.
Butler: I shall do as you bid,\nmy lady.
Butler: I sincerely thank you for\npleasing Lady SELPHY.\cPlease accept this as her thanks…
Butler: Your BAG appears to be\nunfortunately full.
Oh…\nHow disappointing.
SELPHY: I wish you the best of\nluck.
Butler: The smile of Lady SELPHY\nhas the brilliance of the sun.\cPlease, I beg you to bring joy\nto Lady SELPHY.
I perfected the ultimate move of\nits type…\cBut will no one take it for\nfuture use?\c…Hm? Hmmm!\cY-you…\nTh-that [STR_VAR_1]…
…No…\nI was just mistaken.
Oh! This is the one!\nThis is the POKéMON!\cThis [STR_VAR_1] is worthy of\nlearning my ultimate move!\cWill you allow it?\cWill you allow your [STR_VAR_1] to\nlearn my [STR_VAR_2]?
Gaah! You reject it?\nNo, I won't be dissuaded!
You will allow it?\cThen, let me confer my ultimate\n[STR_VAR_2] on your [STR_VAR_1].\cGgggrah-awooo!
Gasp, gasp, gasp…\cI didn't think I could teach that\nmove while I still lived…
I implore you to make the best\nuse of that move and gain power!
Gasp, gasp, gasp…\cI have no regrets now.\nI've passed on everything I know.\cNow I can live out my life knowing\nmy work is done.
After I passed on my knowledge to\nyou, I felt so much relief.\cIn fact, I feel rejuvenated,\nas if I were younger again!
Hera, hera, HERACROSS!\nBig and shiny, it's the bug boss!\rLove it, need it, HERACROSS!
Eeeeek!\nThat's a HERACROSS!\cPlease, please, may I measure how\nbig it is?
Eeeek, it's [STR_VAR_2] inches!\nI've never seen anything like this!\rYou deserve a reward!
I want to see a much, much bigger\nHERACROSS than that one.\cOh, how I adore them, big\nHERACROSS!
Huh? This [STR_VAR_2]-inch measurement…\nOh, boo! It's the same as before.
Oh, it's just [STR_VAR_2] inches.\nThe HERACROSS before was bigger.\cIt was [STR_VAR_3] inches, the biggest\nHERACROSS you've brought me.
Oh, no! This won't do!\cHERACROSS looks much more macho\nand cool, and has a lovely horn!
Your BAG is full.\nMy reward won't fit.
The biggest HERACROSS that I have\never seen measured so far is:\c[STR_VAR_3] inches!
It's a blank chart of some sort.\cIt has spaces for writing in\nrecords of some kind.
My height is 67.0 inches on the\nbutton.\cI know it is this precisely because\nmy neighbor measured me.
Dance, dance!\nCHANSEY Dance!\cYou join in, too!\nDance, dance!

If POKéMON are hurt in battle,\ntake them to a POKéMON CENTER and\rhave them healed by the staff.\rGet in the habit of saving your\rgame and recording your progress.\rStock up on healing items at\rPOKéMON MARTS before traveling far.
Forests are basically the same as\nroads but they can be like mazes.\rAll forests have a way out, so don't\rgive up if you get lost.
Caves are dark and dangerous. Wild\nPOKéMON can appear anywhere in them.\rIf there is an emergency, rush to a\rPOKéMON CENTER or use items.\rNew towns await discovery beyond some\rcaves, so don't give up.
The object of the game is to train\nyour POKéMON and move forward.\rYou must collect info and solve\rproblems. For example, what do you\rneed to get around an obstacle?\rWhat would get that impeding\rperson out of the way?
There are several kinds of items.\nSome can be used only on the field.\rSome are only for use during battle.\rSome can be used anytime.\rTry using an item - if it can't be used,\ryou will be alerted.
In a battle, POKéMON try to reduce\none another's vitality, expressed as\rHP. If a POKéMON's HP falls to zero,\rit faints, and the other POKéMON\rwins. By winning a battle, POKéMON\rearn EXP. Points, which help them\rlevel up (grow stronger).
First, fully heal the POKéMON in your\nparty (the POKéMON with you) at any\rPOKéMON CENTER.\rYou should also buy healing items for\remergencies at a POKéMON MART.
A POKéMON's vitality is expressed in HP.\nIf a POKéMON is hurt in battle, HP is\rsubtracted. If its HP drops to zero,\rthe POKéMON faints.\rHeal hurt or fainted POKéMON at a\rPOKéMON CENTER or by using items.
A POKéMON CENTER is like an inn for\nPOKéMON. It will fully heal POKéMON of\rany status problems and fully restore\rtheir HP using a special machine.\rThis service is free, so get in the\rhabit of healing your POKéMON often.
A status problem refers to an ailment\nthat is inflicted on a POKéMON by its\rfoe's attack. These include burns,\rparalysis, poisoning, sleep, and\rfreezing. These can be healed by\rvisiting a POKéMON CENTER or using\rthe appropriate item.
If all the POKéMON in your party\n(all the POKéMON with you) faint, you\rlose some MONEY, and you are\rreturned home or to a POKéMON\rCENTER. To reduce that chance, visit\rPOKéMON CENTERS often. Also, get\rin the habit of saving often.
If a wild POKéMON escapes from a POKé\nBALL, it's obviously still feisty.\rTry reducing its HP some more, and\rtry to weaken it with paralysis or sleep\rbefore trying to catch it.\rIf the POKé BALL rocks for a while,\rthe quarry is close to being caught!
There are shops, known as POKéMON\nMARTS, that sell items.\rYou will not find POKéMON MARTS on\rroads, in forests, or in caves.\rStock up on needed items while you are\rvisiting a town with a POKéMON MART.
You may buy POKé BALLS at any\nPOKéMON MART in any town.\rYou will not find POKéMON MARTS on\rroads, in forests, or in caves.\rStock up on POKé BALLS while you are\rvisiting a town with a POKéMON MART.
A TRAINER is a person who raises\nPOKéMON through battling.\rTRAINERS will challenge you \rwherever they are - it could be on\ra road, in forests, caves, anywhere.\rIf your eyes meet, you have to accept\rtheir challenge. So be careful!
To beat a TRAINER in battle, use\nPOKéMON that have type advantages\rover the foe's POKéMON. You may also\ruse highly trained POKéMON with\roverwhelming power. Outnumbering the\rfoe's POKéMON is another obvious\rtactic.
Wild POKéMON will appear in tall grass,\non roads, and in forests. They will\rappear anywhere in dark caves.\rThere are no wild POKéMON or TRAINERS\rin towns, so they are safe places.
POKéMON may learn up to four different\ntechniques, or moves. There is a great\rvariety of moves including attacks and\rthose with special effects. The kinds\rof moves that can be learned vary\rfor each POKéMON. Some moves\rcan be learned from machines.
HIDDEN moves are those that are\nespecially important for your\radventure. To use such a move outside\rof battle, open the “POKéMON” MENU\rand make the POKéMON that knows the\rmove use it. A fainted POKéMON may use\ra HIDDEN move outside of battle.
Select “FIGHT,” and the MENU of moves\nwill appear. Consider the type\rmatchups, and use the most effective\rmoves. You can check the effects of\rmoves by opening “POKéMON,”\rpicking a POKéMON, opening “SUMMARY,”\rthen opening “POKéMON SKILLS.”
The most a POKéMON can learn is four\nmoves. They are learned as the\rPOKéMON levels up. It can also be\rtaught a move using a TM (Technical\rMachine) or HM (Hidden Machine).\rThere are also people who teach moves.
The key to making your POKéMON\nstrong is to battle and win often.\rThe EXP. (Experience) Points earned\rby winning battles accumulate to\rlevel up POKéMON that participated in\rthem. Battle wild POKéMON often to\rlevel up your party.
If your foes are too strong, try\nleveling up your POKéMON some more.\rGo back the way you came and battle\rwild POKéMON to level up your party.\rYou may also battle TRAINERS whom you\rhave not battled before.
Unlike roads and forests, wild POKéMON\ncan appear anywhere in caves.\rIf your POKéMON are hurt in a cave,\rrush to a POKéMON CENTER or use items\rto heal them right away. It is very\rdangerous to force your luck in caves.
Trust your own knowledge and power.\nBelieve in yourself and find your way!
A POKéMON CENTER is identified by its\nred roof and a “P.C” sign. Every\rPOKéMON CENTER offers such services as\rfully healing POKéMON and free PC use,\rmaking it essential for your travels.\rOn the upper floor are facilities for\rlinking with friends and others.
A POKéMON MART is identified by its\nblue roof and a “MART” sign.\rItems can be bought and sold at any\rPOKéMON MART. Some MARTS carry items\rthat are available only in their towns.
You can safely end your game by\nselecting “SAVE” on the MENU.\rOnce you have saved, the game can be\rsafely turned off. When the game is\rturned back on, you can resume from\rwhere you last saved.
POKéMON are living beings about which\nmany mysteries still remain. You may\rsee them in grass, the sea, and caves.\rThey appear to obey the wishes of the\rTRAINERS that caught them.
Use the FAME CHECKER among the\nKEY ITEMS in your BAG.\rIt may give you a hint, so try it out.
A HIDDEN move is taught to a POKéMON\nusing an HM (Hidden Machine).\rA HIDDEN move is important for helping\ryour adventure. For example, one is\rused to light up dark caves. Another\rcuts down small trees. There is one\rfor traveling on water, and so on.
Try to catch wild POKéMON by throwing\nthe special SAFARI BALLS.\rYou may keep any item you find, too.
Your SAFARI GAME ends once you have\ntraveled a certain distance or thrown\rall your SAFARI BALLS.\rOpen the MENU to check the remaining\rnumber of steps and SAFARI BALLS.
If you would like to cut your SAFARI\nGAME short, open the MENU and select\r“RETIRE” at the top of the list.
POKéMON GYMS are operated by the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE and are training\rfacilities for TRAINERS. They are all\racross the land in cities and towns.\rEach one is headed by a LEADER, who\ris a very skilled TRAINER. Beat the\rLEADER to collect a BADGE.

HP indicates a POKéMON's vitality.\nIf a POKéMON's HP drops to zero, it\rfaints and is unable to battle.\rSo, the key in battle is to try to\rreduce the foe's HP to zero.\rIf your POKéMON are hurt, restore their\rHP at a POKéMON CENTER or use items.
EXP. Points stands for “Experience\nPoints.” POKéMON gain EXP. Points by\rparticipating in winning battles.\rWhen a POKéMON accumulates sufficient\rEXP. Points, it levels up. The EXP. Bar\rindicates accumulated EXP. Points.\rIt returns to zero upon leveling up.
POKéMON may learn up to four different\nmoves. There are many kinds of moves\rincluding attacks and those with\rspecial effects. The kinds of moves\rthat can be learned vary for each\rPOKéMON. Some moves can be learned\rfrom items.
ATTACK indicates the power of an\noffensive move. The higher this stat,\rthe more powerful the move.\rIt is applied for the following move\rtypes: NORMAL, POISON, GROUND,\rFLYING, BUG, FIGHTING, ROCK, GHOST,\rand STEEL.

SPEED indicates the agility of a\nPOKéMON. If this stat exceeds the foe's\rin battle, the POKéMON can make a move\rbefore its slower opponent.
Lv. (Level) indicates the growth and\nstrength of a POKéMON.\rIn general, when a POKéMON levels up,\rits stats such as HP, ATTACK, and\rDEFENSE rise, making it stronger.\rPOKéMON may learn a new move upon\rleveling up.
POKéMON and moves are classified by\ntype. Every type has advantageous and\rdisadvantageous matchups against\rother types. For example, like a rock-\rpaper-scissors game, the WATER type is\rstrong against the FIRE type and weak\ragainst the GRASS type.
OT stands for “Original TRAINER,”\nthe first TRAINER to have caught the\rselected POKéMON.\rEven if the POKéMON is traded, the OT\rname will remain unchanged.
All POKéMON can be made to hold one\nitem each. Some items will be used by\rthe POKéMON automatically in certain\rsituations. To make a POKéMON hold an\ritem, select the item from the BAG and\r“GIVE” it to the POKéMON.
All POKéMON have a special ABILITY.\nThere are many different kinds of these\rabilities, some used in battle, some\relsewhere. The abilities differ from\rspecies to species. Some species may\rhave more than one kind of ability.
Whenever you win a battle against a\nTRAINER, you are given prize money.\rSave up your prize money so you can\renjoy shopping at POKéMON MARTS!
Moves are also classified by types.\nIf a POKéMON of a certain type uses\ra move of the same type, the move's\rpower is boosted. If the move's type\rhas a matchup advantage against the\rtarget, its effectiveness is also\rboosted.
All POKéMON have a personality,\nor “NATURE.” The POKéMON's\rnature appears to affect how the\rPOKéMON will grow upon leveling up.
The ID No. is a special number assigned\nspecifically to you as a TRAINER.\rTogether with the OT name, the ID No.\ris used to precisely identify the\rOriginal TRAINER.\rThe ID No. does not change even if the\rPOKéMON is traded.
PP stands for “Power Points.”\nIt indicates the number of times a\rcertain move can be used in battle.\rLike HP, PP can be restored by visiting\ra POKéMON CENTER or using certain\ritems.
POWER indicates the strength of an\nattack. The higher this number, the\rgreater the damage that can be\rinflicted on the foe!
ACCURACY indicates the probability of\nthe move hitting the foe.\rThe higher this number, the more likely\rthe move will strike the target.
FNT stands for “fainted.”\nA POKéMON faints if its HP is reduced\rto zero. It becomes incapable of taking\rpart in battle.\rRestore a fainted POKéMON at a POKéMON\rCENTER, or use an item.

This indicates the number of species of\nPOKéMON you have caught and/or\revolved to fill the POKéDEX.\rTry hard to catch all sorts of\rPOKéMON!

A TM (Technical Machine) is a device\nused to teach a move to a POKéMON.\rThere are many different kinds.\rMoves can be taught only to those\rPOKéMON capable of using them.\rA TM breaks after a single use.
An HM (Hidden Machine) is a device used\nto teach a HIDDEN move to a POKéMON.\rA HIDDEN move can be taught only to\rthose POKéMON capable of using it.\rUnlike a TM, an HM can be used over\rand over. A HIDDEN move can be tough\rfor a POKéMON to forget.
HIDDEN moves are those that are\nespecially important for your\radventure. To use such a move outside\rof battle, open the “POKéMON” MENU\rand make the POKéMON that knows the\rmove use it. A fainted POKéMON may use\ra HIDDEN move outside of battle.
Among POKéMON, there are some that\nundergo major changes (evolution) upon\rgrowing to certain levels. Evolution\rcauses a POKéMON to alter form, change\rits name, and perhaps change the moves\rit may learn. Some POKéMON evolve\rdue to reasons other than leveling up.
Status problems include:\nSleep: Can't use moves.\rPoison: Causes steady HP loss.\rParalysis: May prevent moves.\rBurn: HP loss and lowers ATTACK.\rFreeze: Can't use moves.\rThese can be healed with items, etc.
POKéMON is a name given to describe\nwondrous creatures that inhabit all\rcorners of this world.\rPeople raise POKéMON to be their pets,\ruse them for battling, and so on.
The ID No. is a special number assigned\nspecifically to you as a TRAINER.\rTogether with the OT name, the ID No.\ris used to precisely identify the\rOriginal TRAINER.\rThe ID No. does not change even if the\rPOKéMON is traded.

It's crammed full of POKéMON\nbooks.
ほんだなに　ならんでいるのは\nポケモンの　ほん　ばかりだ
A TOWN MAP.
Wow!\nTons of POKéMON stuff!
Dishes and plates are neatly\nlined up.
It smells delicious!\nSomebody's been cooking here.
It's a nicely made dresser.\nIt will hold a lot of stuff.
There's a pile of snacks here.
All your item needs fulfilled!\nPOKéMON MART
Heal Your POKéMON!\nPOKéMON CENTER
INDIGO PLATEAU\cThe ultimate goal of TRAINERS!\nPOKéMON LEAGUE HQ
INDIGO PLATEAU\cThe highest POKéMON authority!\nPOKéMON LEAGUE HQ
It should be packed with all kinds\nof delicious things to eat.
It's a blueprint of some sort.\nIt's filled with diagrams and text.
It's a pretty picture of a POKéMON.\nIt looks like it's feeling good.
What could this machine be?\nBetter not mess around with it!
It's a telephone.\nBetter not use it.
It's all complicated words and\nnumbers that make no sense…
It's an advertising poster about\nall kinds of products.
Oh, that smells tasty!\nIt might get the stomach growling!
Inside this…\n……\cThere's nothing here!
It's a cup with a POKéMON mark\non it.
The window is very well polished.
Outside the window…\cThe sky looks fantastically\nbeautiful.
Lights in different colors are\nflashing on and off.
All sorts of tools are lined up\nneatly.
It's a machine of some sort.\nIt sure is impressive.
It's the latest video game!\nIt sure looks fun!
There are obvious signs of burglary\nhere…
There's a POKéMON on TV!\nIt looks like it's having fun.
The battery isn't charged enough.\cNo. of steps required to fully\ncharge the battery: [STR_VAR_1][PAUSE_UNTIL_PRESS]
There are no TRAINERS within range\nwho can battle…\cThe VS SEEKER was turned off.[PAUSE_UNTIL_PRESS]
The other TRAINERS don't appear\nto be ready for battle.\cLet's wait till later.[PAUSE_UNTIL_PRESS]
Hey!\nI saw you in VIRIDIAN FOREST!
Hi! I like shorts!\nThey're comfy and easy to wear!\cYou should be wearing shorts, too!
Excuse me!\nYou keep looking at me, don't you?
You're a TRAINER, aren't you?\nLet's get with it right away!
That look you give me…\nIt intrigues me so!
Hey! What's wrong with you?\nYou're still not wearing shorts!
I'll battle you with the POKéMON\nI started raising.
Eek!\nDid you push me?
I always catch mushroom POKéMON\non MT. MOON.
Oh! You're that nosy kid who\neavesdropped on us!
Excuse me! Didn't I tell you that\nthis is a private conversation?\cYou shouldn't be listening in,\nyou uncouth person!
I'm trying to find something good\nthat's not a BUG POKéMON, but…
Huh?\nYou want to go with me again?
Me?\nWell, okay. I'll play this once.
Hey, long time!\nHave you gotten better?
You are good at POKéMON, but how\nis your chemistry grade?
All right!\nLet's play another game!
You need strategy to win at\nbattling.\cAre you following my advice?
I've collected many NIDORAN.\nI don't want them to evolve, but…
School is fun, but I still think\nPOKéMON are fun, too.
MEOWTH and PERSIAN are so cute,\nmeow, meow, meow!
We may look silly standing here\nlike this, but I can still battle.
I'm a rambling, gaming dude!\nI'm on a winning streak!
What's a cute, round, and fluffy\nPOKéMON?\cYou already know, don't you?
My bike's still acting up, man.
Okay, kid!\nDon't expect mercy this time!
ELI: Our twin power became even\nbetter!
ANNE: Our twin power powered up!
We're to battle again?\nThis time, you're mine!
I haven't forgotten you were with\nthose good-looking POKéMON.
I'm taking ROCK TUNNEL to go to\nLAVENDER…\cBut I keep getting stopped by\neveryone along the way…
Don't you dare patronize me today!\nWe're playing for keeps!
Bwahaha!\nGreat! I was bored again, eh!
Hahaha!\nA little toughie, as always!
I got up early every day to train\nmy POKéMON from cocoons!
Hahahaha!\nI'll win this time!
Go win, my super BUG POKéMON!
Wow, you came here again?\nMaybe you're a POKéMANIAC, too?\rWant to see my collection?
Ha-hahah-ah-ha!\nI can't stop sneezing!
Hi, kid!\nDid I show you my POKéMON?
I went out to a POKéMON GYM again.\c…But I lost as usual.
Ah!\nThis mountain air is delicious!\rIt's so good, I can't leave!
My head is starting to spin.\nI've been hiking for too long…
Win, lose, or draw!\nNow for our rematch!
Competing is the ultimate thrill.\nI still can't get enough!
You know, right?\nLet's go, but don't cheat!
Hi, there!\cBut be careful!\nI'm still laying down some cables!
I became a TRAINER a while ago.\nBut, I think I can win.
Fwahaha!\nI have never lost!\c…And if I did, I've forgotten all\nabout it!
I have never won before…\cPerhaps I am destined to remain\nthat way…
I'm the best in my class.\nI train every morning and night!
Keep your eyes out for live wires!
I raised my POKéMON carefully.\nThey should be ready by now.\rThis time, they should win, too.
Yeah!\nI got a bite, here!\rTh-this might be the real thing!
You're finally here.\nFishing is a waiting game.
Still can't find a MOON STONE…\nHave you found one?
Electricity has always been my\nspecialty.\cI don't know a thing about POKéMON\nof the sea, though.
The FISHING FOOL vs. POKéMON KID!\nAnother round, fight!
I love fishing, don't get me wrong.\nBut, I wish I had more work…\r…It's hard to give up fishing!
What's catching?\cYou'll never know unless you beat\nme!
JES: I'll win here today and\npropose to my GIA.
GIA: Hey, JES…\nI've been waiting a long time now.\cIf we win today, I'll marry you!
My bird POKéMON remember you!
I want to be the best TRAINER \nwhile I'm a kid!
Wow!\nYou got more cool BADGES!
My cutely grown POKéMON wish to\nbecome reacquainted with you.
I cleaned out my savings and\nbought more CARBOS.
I'm not going to lose this time.\nThe wind's blowing my way!
Oh, you're back?\cSure, I'll play again with you,\nsweetie.
Can't you forget that you battled\nwith me?
What're you starin' at?
I always go with bird POKéMON.\nI've dedicated myself to them.
I used TMs to teach good moves\nto my POKéMON.
My bird POKéMON should be ready\nfor battle this time.
Are you using TMs on POKéMON?\nJust holding them is useless.
Have you taught your bird POKéMON\nhow to FLY?\cYou'll be able to soar with it into\nthe sky! Give it a try.
The legend of the winged mirages…\nYou've heard it, right?
I'm really not into it, but okay.\nLet's go!
Hey!\nI remember you!\cC'mon, c'mon.\nLet's go, let's go, let's go!
You're here again, huh?\nShut up and battle.
We've been riding here because of\nthe wide-open spaces.
POKéMON battle, right?\nCool! Rumble!
KIRI: JAN, I hope we win today.
JAN: KIRI, here we go!\nLet's win for sure this time!
I'm going to keep battling with the\nPOKéMON I got in trades.
You look gentle, so I think I can\nbeat you.\cI'll give it one more go!
When I whistle, bird POKéMON\ngather around.\cThey're amazingly cute!
Hmm? My birds are shivering!\nWait, aren't you that TRAINER…
Oh, you're a little cutie!\nSo like a darling POKéMON!\rI remember you now!
I raise POKéMON for protection\nbecause I live alone.\cThat hasn't changed.
Hey, kid! C'mon!\nI got these off some loser!
Fork over all your cash when you\nlose to me, kid!
What's cool and happening?\nTrading POKéMON, of course.
Want to play with my POKéMON\nagain?
MYA: Hi, we keep meeting,\ndon't we?\cHelp me train my little brother\nagain?
RON: My sister's gotten more\npowerful…
What do you want?
Nice BIKE!\nHand it over quick!
Come out and play, little mouse.\nI'll treat you right!
Hey, wait a second!\nDon't call me and then run away!
I'm feeling hungry and mean!\nI really need a punching bag!
Hey, there!\nWe'll have ourselves a good time!
JED: Are you here to see our\nlove, which knows no bounds?
LEA: Sometimes, the intensity of\nour love scares me.
I told you, there's no getting rich\nquick in battling kids.
I'm mighty proud of my bod, kiddo.\nCome on!
You out for a stroll?
We're BIKERS!\nWe rule the roads, man!
VOLTORB's going to seriously\nelectrify you today!
I leveled up my POKéMON, but it\nabsolutely won't evolve. Why?
Gaah! I really need to exercise\nand seriously trim some flab!
Be a rebel!
Yep, that's a nice BIKE!\nHow's it handle?
Get lost, kid!\nI'm bushed!
I've been checking every grassy\narea for new POKéMON.\cBut it's not always easy…
Koorukukukoo!\nIs my birdcall getting better?
I warned you before, this is my\nturf!\cI don't want you coming around.
I'm almost warmed up to go\nout for a swim.
Wait! Slow down!\nWhat if you have a heart attack?
I love swimming!\nI guess you're the surfing type.
What's beyond the horizon?\nHave you seen?
I tried diving for POKéMON again,\nbut it was a no-go like before.
I look at the sea to forget all\nthe bad things that happened.\c…Like losing to you the last time!
You always get to ride your\nPOKéMON…\cIt looks so relaxing.\nCan I have it if I win?
Swimming's great!\nSunburns aren't!
These waters are treacherous!\nYou shouldn't come back here!
I swam here with my friends…\nI'm tired…\rMust we really battle again?
LIA: You know my brother just\nbecame a TRAINER, right?\cI want to make him better, so I\nneed your help again.
LUC: My big sis taught me all\nabout POKéMON.\cI wonder if I'm better?
The water is shallow here.\nThere are many people swimming.
Are you jealous that I'm\nvacationing on SEAFOAM?
I love floating with the fishes\nhere among the waves.
Were you on vacation, too?
Check out my physique!\cIt's even more buff than ever\nbefore!
Why are you riding a POKéMON?\nHaven't you learned to swim yet?
I rode my bird POKéMON here.
My boyfriend gave me big pearls.\nAnd, they've grown bigger!
I swam here from CINNABAR ISLAND.\nIt wasn't easy, like I said.
CINNABAR, in the west, has a LAB\nfor POKéMON.\cMy daddy works there.
You want to know if the fish are\nbiting?
I got a big haul again!\nWanna go for it once more?
The sea cleanses my body and soul!
きょうも　およぎに\nきちまったぜ
I caught my POKéMON at sea.\nAnd that's where I train them.
Right now, I'm in another triathlon\nmeet!
Ahh!\nFeel the sun and the wind!
Hey, cut it out already.\nYou always scare away the fish!
Keep me company till I get a hit.
LIL: Huh? A battle again?\nIAN, can't you do it alone?
IAN: My sis is still a slob.\nHelp me get her into shape!
I won't lose while I'm here!
Dad took me to a great party on\nthe S.S. ANNE at VERMILION CITY.
I'm a cool guy.\nI've got a girlfriend!\cI'll show her how cool I am for\nsure this time!
Hi!\nMy boyfriend is cool!\rMy conditioning's good today!
I had this feeling…\nI knew I had to battle you again!
My friend has many cute POKéMON.\nI'm so jealous!
I just trained up on MT. MOON,\nbut I've still got gas in the tank!
A POKéMANIAC lives on the cape.\nHave you seen his collection?
You're going to see BILL again?\nFirst, we battle!
I saw your feat from the grass!
Okay!\nI'll stomp you!
You always look so busy…\nAren't you getting tired?
You really must love coming to\nNUGGET BRIDGE.
The time we battled…\cEven though I was the second in\nline, I was the best, wasn't I?
People call this the NUGGET\nBRIDGE!\cYou've already beaten us, so you're\nnot allowed to take the challenge…\c…But, you're welcome to battle with\nus again.
Lying back, rocked by the waves…\nI don't notice time slipping by…
The weather's gorgeous!\nI'll try not to spoil it.
My sunburn is starting to hurt…
The fire bird's mountain casts\na huge shadow…
I have this strong feeling that\nI can win this time!
Wait! Wait a second!\nI'm sure I've hooked a big one!
You'll help me out with my\ntraining again?
We haven't missed a single day of\ntraining yet!
Every morning, before breakfast,\nI swim around this island…\rThree times!
Dress appropriately for battle!\nLose that frivolous outfit, I said!
You know, everything tastes great\nwhen you're out in the wild.
I ate too much again, so will you\nbattle us for some exercise?
KIA: My big brother and I make\nan awesome combination!\cWe won't lose this time!
MIK: Together with KIA, we're\nafraid of nothing!\cWe'll prove it to you this time!
Are we to battle again?
From where have you come, and\nwhere are you bound?
I want to swim without my float\nring soon.
Yay, yay!\nPOKéMON!
Oh, no, didn't I tell you already?\nPlease, stay away from me!
JOY: We've gotten stronger!\nLots and lots!
MEG: You can't beat us today!
Oh, hello!\cAre you raising your POKéMON in a\ngood environment?
With these hands, I will create\nmy victory today.
Must I repeat myself?\nI'm trying to paint.\rPlease keep out of my sight!
I haven't made any progress…\nI still can't get the right angle…
Oh, you will give me another\nopportunity to match wits with you?
They're almost finished making the\npool for my POKéMON.\cYou must drop in for a visit.
I'm a good runner.\nI've gotten even faster!
I say, friend!\nLet us enjoy our time together!
I'm the eldest of the BIRD\nBROTHERS. Remember me?\cThat's right, I'm the one who loves\nbirds for their beaks!
I'm the middle kid of the BIRD\nBROTHERS.\cI'm the one that loves wings.\nLet's battle again!
I'm the youngest of the BIRD\nBROTHERS.\cI love birds for their down.\nI didn't think I'd see you again!
I'm still having no luck at all.\nA battle'd be a change of pace!
Gasp… Gasp…\cI swam here from SIX ISLAND's port\nin one go again.
You always come along while I'm\nswimming.
AVA: Let's have another\ntwo-on-two marine battle today!
GEB: My big sister and I are way\ntougher than before!
…Huh?\cI envision my house, but TELEPORT\nalways brings me here!
Oh, hello.\nA pleasant breeze is blowing again.
Hehehe, I'm practicing in secret\nagain.
What, you're sick of seeing\nSWIMMERS like me?\cAww, don't be hatin'!\nBattle with me again.
Sigh…\nMy boyfriend's busy again…
Come on, tell me, where are the\nmountains around these parts?
MIU: Hello, POKéMON!\nIt's time to play again!
MIA: Hello, POKéMON!\nIt's time to battle again!
There appear to be many secrets\nstill unsolved in this world.
Hi, didn't we meet before?\nWhat compelled you to come back?
It's been said that there are\nmysterious stones on this island.\cHave you discovered anything since\nwe last met?
A rematch with you, so high up!
I'm pretty familiar with the land\naround these parts.
I sensed your approach.
Somewhere on this island, peculiar\nPOKéMON are sleeping.
Kyahaha!\cComing back won't change a thing.\nI'll flick you away effortlessly!
Howdy! You're a member of my\nfan club, isn't that right?
This island is too spread out…\nPatrolling the place is a drag…
I don't forgive people who abuse\nPOKéMON!
EVE: I'll team up with JON and\nbattle together again.
JON: When I'm with EVE, it feels\nlike we could never lose, not ever.
Let's have another battle.\nMy conditioning's in top form!
It doesn't matter if you happen to\nhave the strongest POKéMON…\cIt doesn't mean a thing if you don't\nknow how to use them properly!
I work to protect the environment.\nIn turn, nature protects me!
Every time we meet, you have those\nsnazzy shoes on.
You must have gotten tougher.\nLet me battle you, please!
I was given the best possible\neducation to become this strong.\cI won't lose this time.\nAbsolutely not!
LEX: My darling NYA, together\nwe will win for certain!
NYA: I won't drag down my mentor\nLEX! We're going to win!
Have you discovered anything about\nthis stone chamber?
A mystic POKéMON is said to sleep\ninside here.
My teacher is showing me how to\npaint some more.
Today, in addition to our lesson,\nwe came to see the chamber again.

Hello, there!\nGlad to meet you!\cWelcome to the world of POKéMON!\cMy name is OAK.\cPeople affectionately refer to me\nas the POKéMON PROFESSOR.\c
This world…
…is inhabited far and wide by\ncreatures called POKéMON.\c
For some people, POKéMON are pets.\nOthers use them for battling.\cAs for myself…\cI study POKéMON as a profession.\c
But first, tell me a little about\nyourself.\c
Let's begin with your name.\nWhat is it?\c
Right…\nSo your name is [PLAYER].
This is my grandson.\cHe's been your rival since you both\nwere babies.\c…Erm, what was his name now?
Your rival's name, what was it now?
…Er, was it [RIVAL]?
That's right! I remember now!\nHis name is [RIVAL]!\c
[PLAYER]!\cYour very own POKéMON legend is\nabout to unfold!\cA world of dreams and adventures\nwith POKéMON awaits! Let's go!
POKé DUDE: The speedier of the\nbattlers gets to attack first.
It looks like my RATTATA was\nfaster than the PIDGEY.
The battlers take turns attacking\nand reducing each other's HP.
My RATTATA reduced the foe's HP\nto zero, so it wins!\cThe POKéMON that took part in the\nbattle get EXP. Points.\cWhen a POKéMON collects enough\nEXP. Points, it levels up.\cLeveling up makes your POKéMON\nstronger than before.
POKé DUDE: Uh-oh…\nMy RATTATA has been poisoned…\cIf a POKéMON is poisoned, it loses\nHP steadily.
If a POKéMON develops a status\nproblem, heal it right away.
Using an item on a POKéMON uses\nup one turn, though.\cNow, it's the opponent's turn!
Yay!\nWe managed to win!
POKé DUDE: The move BUBBLE is\na WATER-type attack.\cThe targeted ODDISH is a\nGRASS/POISON-type POKéMON.\cThe WATER-type attack is absorbed\nby the GRASS-type POKéMON…\cAs a result, the move becomes not\nvery effective, and inflicts only\rhalf the usual damage.
Uh-oh, this is not good!\cThe ABSORB attack you just saw\nis a GRASS-type move.\cPOLIWAG is a WATER-type POKéMON.\cSo, ABSORB becomes super\neffective, doubling the damage.
It's not going to be easy to win\nwith this matchup…\cLet's try shifting POKéMON!
Shifting POKéMON in and out uses\nup one turn.\cNow, it's the opponent's turn.
BUTTERFREE is a BUG/FLYING-type\nPOKéMON.\cAgainst this POKéMON, a GRASS-\ntype attack…\c…inflicts only half the usual\ndamage on a BUG-type POKéMON…\c…And, it also causes only half the\ndamage on a FLYING-type POKéMON.\cTherefore, BUTTERFREE, being a\nBUG/FLYING POKéMON, only takes\rone quarter of the usual damage.
ODDISH is a GRASS/POISON-type\nPOKéMON.\cA FLYING- or PSYCHIC-type attack\nis super effective against it.\cOne of those types of attacks will\ninflict double the usual damage.\cOkay, here we go!
Yeah!\nWe won!
POKé DUDE: When you're trying to\ncatch a POKéMON, don't throw any\rPOKé BALLS right away.\cFirst, you need to weaken it by\nreducing its HP.
Okay, that should be good enough.\cBut, if it's possible, it would be\nbest if the target has a status\rproblem.\cFor instance, it would be easier\nto catch if it were asleep or\rparalyzed.
This will make the POKéMON a lot\neasier to catch!\cOh, yes. If you paralyze a\nPOKéMON, you can't make it fall\rasleep on top of paralysis.\cIn other words, you can't double\nup status problems, okay?
Okay!\nLet me throw my POKé BALL!
Before you throw a POKé BALL,\nconsider the condition and the\rtype of POKéMON, and pick the kind\rof BALL that would work best.

とても　かわいい　はなが　さく。
まっかな　みは　とても　からい。
そとの　かわの　ぶぶんも　なかみも　すべてが
かたい。　どこを　たべても　しぶい。
とても　あまくて　おいしい。
やわらかいので　はこぶときは　ちゅうい。
はっぱの　ぶぶんが　ながく　まるまっていると
みが　とても　にがく　なるらしい。
かたい　みの　なかには　すいぶんが　とても
おおく　ふくまれている。　かなり　すっぱい。
クラボなどに　くらべて　すこし　そだつのが
おそい。　みが　ちいさいほど　おいしい。
いろいろな　あじが　まざった　ふしぎな　み。
みを　つけるのに　はんにち　かかる。
たいようが　だいすき。　ひに　あたると
どんどん　いろが　あざやかに　なる。
そだつのに　じかんが　かかるが　たいせつに
そだてると　みが　２つ　つくことも　ある。
オレンとは　きょうだいの　ような　そんざい。
おおきくて　あじも　ととのっている。
たべられた　あとのような　かたちの　なかには
からい　せいぶんが　つまっている。
まわりに　ついている　イボイボは　ポケモンが
もちやすいように　できたと　いわれている。
おおきく　なれば　なるほど　みが　まがる。
まがるほど　あまくて　おいしい。
ちいさい　サイズの　はなで　しかも　ひかりを
ひつようと　しない　めずらしい　きのみ。
とても　おおきな　すっぱい　きのみ。
そだてるには　みじかくても　１にち　かかる。
あかい　みは　たべると　ちょっぴり　からい。
そだつのが　はやく　４じかんで　みを　つける
そとがわは　あおいいろだが　たべると
くちの　なかが　まっくろに　なる。
せかいで　７ばんめに　はっけん　されたので
ナナという　せつが　ゆうりょく。　あまい。
ちいさな　しろい　はなが　さく。　にがさと
すっぱさが　まざりあった　びみょうな　あじ。
かぜに　よわく　さむさにも　よわい。
みの　なかが　からく　そとがわが　すっぱい。
どんなに　みずを　あげても　えいようが
あっても　６つの　み　しか　つけない。
ねっこの　ような　かたちの　めずらしい
しゅるい。　とても　おおきな　はなが　さく。
みずが　だいすき。　ずっと　あめが　ふる
ばしょでも　しっかりと　そだつ。
とても　こうかで　なかなか　めに　することが
できない　きのみ。　とても　おいしい。
やわらかさと　まるい　かたちからは
そうぞうが　できないほど　すっぱい。
くちびるが　まがって　しまうほど　からい。
そだてるにも　じかんが　かかる。
おおむかしから　はえていた。　たくさん
うえないと　みが　つかないときも　ある。
とても　あじの　バランスが　よいと
ひょうばんの　きのみ。
たくさんの　けが　はえている　めずらしい
しゅるい。　かなり　にがい。
かなり　すっぱい。　１くち　たべると
３にちかん　ほかの　あじが　しなくなる。
まっかになった　みは　とてつもなく　からい。
イボからも　からい　せいぶんが　でている。
どこからともなく　うみを　ただよってくる。
せかいの　どこかで　そだっている　らしい。
とても　おおきく　５０センチを　こえるものも
はっけん　された。　ものすごく　あまい。
みただけで　にがい。　あまりにも　にがいので
そのままで　たべたひとは　だれもいない。
つるつるとして　おいしそうだが　とてつもなく
すっぱい。　そだてるにも　じかんが　かかる。
なぞのタネ。　チイラのみには　うみの
ちからが　やどるという　うわさが　ある。
なぞのタネ。　リュガのみには　りくの
ちからが　やどるという　うわさが　ある。
なぞのタネ。　カムラのみには　そらの
ちからが　やどるという　うわさが　ある。
なぞのタネ。　ヤタピのみには　すべての
いきものの　ちからが　やどると　いわれている
ふしぎな　ふしぎな　きのみ。　なにが
おこるのか　なにが　できるのか　わからない。
でんせつのみ　と　いわれている。　この　みを
もつと　とても　しあわせに　なるらしい。
あまりにも　ちからが　つよすぎるため
せかいの　はてに　すてた　まぼろしのみ。
しょうたい　ふめいの　きのみ。
ほしの　ちからを　もっている　らしい。

The TRAINER that makes the other\nTRAINER's POKéMON faint by lowering\rtheir HP to “0,” wins.\c
But rather than talking about it,\nyou'll learn more from experience.\cTry battling and see for yourself.\c

OAK: Keep your eyes on your\nPOKéMON's HP.\cIt will faint if the HP drops to\n“0.”\c

Hey, all you TRAINERS out there!\nHELLO, TRAINERS!\c……… ……… ………\cCome on, let me hear you!\nHELLO, TRAINERS!\rIt's me, the POKé DUDE!\c
Today, the POKé DUDE's here to\ntell you about how you can battle\rPOKéMON!\cSay you're out for a stroll when,\nsuddenly, a wild POKéMON appears!\cIt's up to you to smartly use your\nPOKéMON and their moves to reduce\rthe opponent's HP to nothing, and\rclaim victory!\cI'll show you how to do that in\nperson and for sure!\cAll righty, here goes!\cKeep your eyes glued to the super\nPOKé DUDE SHOW!
Well, did you get that?\cEven if your own POKéMON's HP\nfalls to zero, and it becomes\runable to battle, not to worry!\cJust take it to any POKéMON\nCENTER and heal it!\cAll righty, be seeing you!\cRemember, TRAINERS, a good deed\na day brings happiness to stay!
Today, the POKé DUDE's here to\ntell you about status problems!\cStatus problems include poisoning,\nparalysis, sleep, burn…\cThere are a couple others, but\nthey really are trouble.\cGet any one, and your POKéMON\nmay become useless in battle.\cYou know, it hurts the POKé DUDE\nto see a POKéMON suffer…\cSo, what should you do if your\nPOKéMON gets a status problem?\cWell, you've got me to show you!\cAll righty, here goes!\cKeep your eyes glued to the super\nPOKé DUDE SHOW!
Poisoning or paralysis don't go\naway after a battle.\cIf a POKéMON is poisoned, it loses\nHP even while you're walking.\cYou should heal POKéMON of these\nkinds of problems right away.\cUse an item, or try to get to a\nPOKéMON CENTER for healing.\cThat wasn't hard, was it?\nAll righty, be seeing you!\cRemember, TRAINERS, a good deed\na day brings happiness to stay!
Does everyone know about type\nmatchups?\cPOKéMON and their moves all\nbelong to certain types.\cFor example, there are such types\nas GRASS and WATER.\cYou need to consider the type of\nthe move used to attack…\cAnd, the type of the POKéMON that\nis hit by that attack.\cDepending on how those two types\nmatch up, the damage can change.\cYou see, it depends on whether\nthe type matchup is good or bad.\cIf you don't know how matchups\nwork, battles will be tough.\cSo, let me demonstrate exactly\nwhat I mean.\cAll righty, here goes!\cKeep your eyes glued to the super\nPOKé DUDE SHOW!
Is it possible to launch an attack\nthat will inflict heavy damage?\cDoes the opposing POKéMON pose\na threat to your POKéMON?\cIs there any chance that it may\nhave disastrously tough moves?\cWatch the type matchups to gain\nthe upper hand!\cAll righty, be seeing you!\cOh, for the COOL-type POKé DUDE,\nAWESOME-type kids like you match\rup perfectly!\cRemember, a good deed a day\nbrings happiness to stay!
Today, the POKé DUDE's going to\nshow you how to catch POKéMON!\cJust imagine… A groovy POKéMON\nsuddenly appearing in the wild!\cOh, you want it!\nYou just can't help it!\cOh, you have to catch it!\nYou gotta have it!\cLet me show you how you can make\nit happen!\cAll righty, here goes!\cKeep your eyes glued to the super\nPOKé DUDE SHOW!
If your first POKé BALL fails to\ncatch the POKéMON, don't give up!\cKeep throwing POKé BALLS…\nIt's bound to work sometime!\cAll righty, be seeing you!\cRemember, TRAINERS, a good deed\na day brings happiness to stay!
Hey, everyone!\nDo you all have TMs?\cA TM, Technical Machine, is an\namazingly great item!\cIt teaches POKéMON a move that\nit may not learn when leveling up!\cIsn't that just great? What a\nconvenient world we live in!\cOpen the TM CASE and check out\nthe TMs you have.\cYou can check them out in detail,\ntoo.
POKé DUDE: NORMAL, WATER, GRASS…\nTMs also come in types.\cCheck the type and teach it to\na POKéMON that matches up well.\cFor example, WATER PULSE is\nsuitable for WATER-type POKéMON.\cBULLET SEED is a move that most\nGRASS-type POKéMON can learn.\cThere's one other thing!
Don't just look at the type, read\nthe description, too.\cIt will contain hints about what\nPOKéMON might learn the move.\cFor example, take a move like\nFOCUS PUNCH.\cIt doesn't sound like anything a\nbird or fish POKéMON can learn.\cSo, try using it on POKéMON with\narms that can throw punches!
Wow, I talked a lot today!\nAll righty, be seeing you!\cRemember, TRAINERS, a good deed\na day brings happiness to stay!
A TRAINER's BAG has a bunch of\nnifty, convenient features!\cTake stuff in the KEY ITEMS\nPOCKET, for instance.\cYou can use a key item without\nopening the BAG every time.\cFor example, let's pretend I have\na TEACHY TV in my BAG.\cI can register it for instant use,\nand I'll show you how!\cAll righty, here goes!\cKeep your eyes glued to the sorta\nsuper POKé DUDE SHOW!
And now, your TEACHY TV is\nregistered.\cHow do you use it?\nWell, here's how it works.\cOnce an item in the KEY ITEMS\nPOKCET is registered, you can use\rit by pressing SELECT.\cSo, you've given yourself\none-touch access to TEACHY TV.\cAll it takes for you to see me is\npressing one button!\cThat kind of attention is a little\nembarrassing!\cAll righty, be seeing you!\cRemember, TRAINERS, a good deed\na day brings happiness to stay!

[CLEAR 17]

This is a newly discovered POKéMON. It is\ncurrently under investigation. No detailed\ninformation is available at this time.

There is a plant seed on its back right\nfrom the day this POKéMON is born.\nThe seed slowly grows larger.

There is a plant bulb on its back.\nWhen it absorbs nutrients, the bulb is said\nto blossom into a large flower.

A bewitching aroma wafts from its flower.\nThe fragrance becalms those engaged in\na battle.

From the time it is born, a flame burns\nat the tip of its tail. Its life would end\nif the flame were to go out.

It lashes about with its tail to knock\ndown its foe. It then tears up the fallen\nopponent with sharp claws.

Its wings can carry this POKéMON close to\nan altitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out\nfire at very high temperatures.

When it retracts its long neck into its\nshell, it squirts out water with vigorous\nforce.

This POKéMON is very popular as a pet.\nIts fur-covered tail is a symbol of its\nlongevity.

It crushes its foe under its heavy body\nto cause fainting. In a pinch, it will\nwithdraw inside its shell.

It is covered with a green skin. When it\ngrows, it sheds the skin, covers itself\nwith silk, and becomes a cocoon.

Even though it is encased in a sturdy\nshell, the body inside is tender.\nIt can't withstand a harsh attack.

The wings are protected by rain-repellent\ndust. As a result, this POKéMON can fly\nabout even in rain.

Often found in forests and grasslands.\nIt has a sharp, toxic barb of around two\ninches on top of its head.

This POKéMON is in a temporary stage\nwhile making its body. It is almost\ncompletely unable to move on its own.

May appear in a swarm. Flies at violent\nspeeds, all the while stabbing with the\ntoxic stinger on its rear.

Does not like to fight. It hides in\ntall grass and so on, foraging for food\nsuch as small bugs.

The claws on its feet are well developed.\nIt can carry prey such as an EXEGGCUTE\nto its nest over 60 miles away.

It spreads its gorgeous wings widely to\nintimidate enemies. It races through the\nskies at Mach-2 speed.

Its fangs are long and very sharp.\nThey grow continuously, so it gnaws on\nhard things to whittle them down.

Its rear feet have three toes each.\nThey are webbed, enabling it to swim\nacross rivers.

It busily flits around here and there.\nEven if it is frail, it can be a tough\nfoe that uses MIRROR MOVE.

Its huge and magnificent wings can keep it\naloft in the sky. It can remain flying a\nwhole day without landing.

A very common sight in grassland, etc.\nIt flicks its tongue in and out to sense\ndanger in its surroundings.

The pattern on its belly appears to be a\nfrightening face. Weak foes will flee just\nat the sight of the pattern.

It has small electric sacs on both its\ncheeks. If threatened, it looses electric\ncharges from the sacs.

Its electric charges can reach even\n100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause\neven an Indian elephant to faint.

It burrows and lives underground.\nIf threatened, it curls itself up into a\nball for protection.

It is adept at attacking with the spines\non its back and its sharp claws while\nquickly scurrying about.

Though small, it must be treated with\ncaution because of its powerfully toxic\nbarbs. The female has smaller horns.

The female has a gentle temperament.\nIt emits ultrasonic cries that have the\npower to befuddle foes.

The body is covered by stiff, needle-\nlike scales. If it becomes excited,\nthe needles bristle outwards.

Its large ears are flapped like wings\nwhen it is listening to distant sounds.\nIt extends toxic barbs when angered.

It is easily angered. By swinging its well-\ndeveloped horn wildly, it can even punch\nthrough diamond.

It is recognized by its rock-hard hide\nand its extended horn. Be careful with\nthe horn as it contains venom.

Its adorable appearance makes it popular\nas a pet. However, it is rare and\ndifficult to find.

It has an acute sense of hearing. It can\neasily hear a pin being dropped nearly\n1,100 yards away.

While young, it has six gorgeous tails.\nWhen it grows, several new tails are\nsprouted.

It has nine long tails and fur that \ngleams gold. It is said to live for \n1,000 years.

It captivates foes with its huge, round\neyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing\na soothing melody.

Its fur is extremely fine, dense, and\nsupple. The exquisitely pleasant fur\nconveys an image of luxury.

It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on\nits ultrasonic cries for echo location to\nflit about in darkness.

It clamps down on its prey with needle-\nsharp fangs and drains over 10 ounces of\nblood in one gulp.

Its scientific name is “Oddium Wanderus.”\nAt night, it is said to walk nearly 1,000\nfeet on its two roots.

Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor.\nThe horrid stench can cause fainting at a\ndistance of 1.25 miles.

Its petals are the largest in the world.\nIt fiendishly scatters allergy-causing\npollen from its petals.
