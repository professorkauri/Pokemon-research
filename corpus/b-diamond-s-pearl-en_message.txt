Your Adventure Begins
You are about to enter a world where you will\nembark on a grand adventure of your very own.
Speak to people and check things wherever you\ngo, be it in towns, roads, or caves. Gather\ninformation and hints from every possible source.
New paths will open to you when you help people\nin need, overcome challenges, and solve mysteries.
At times, you will be challenged by others to a\nbattle. At other times, wild creatures may stand\nin your way. By overcoming such hurdles, you\nwill gain great power.
However, your adventure is not solely about\nbecoming powerful.
On your travels, we hope that you will meet\ncountless people and, through them,\nachieve personal growth.\nThis is the most important objective of\nthis adventure.
The Guidebook
This <color=#F01E1EFF>Guidebook </color>explains how to use various\nfunctions, facilities, and items that will help you\non your journey.\nMore content will be added to the <color=#F01E1EFF>Guidebook </color>as\nyou progress through your adventure.\nThe <color=#F01E1EFF>Guidebook </color>can be found in the <color=#F01E1EFF>Key Items\n</color>pocket of your <color=#F01E1EFF>Bag</color>, and you can check it at\nany time.

The Pokédex
Professor Rowan has entrusted you with the task of\ncompleting your <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokédex</color>. Each time you catch a\nnew Pokémon, its information will be\nautomatically recorded.\nSelect <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokédex </color>from the menu to view your registries.
Your Pokédex stores all sorts of <color=#F01E1EFF>data </color>about each\nPokémon you add to it, including its category,\nappearance, type, and gender ratios.\nYou can also select <color=#F01E1EFF>Habitat </color>to see where a\nPokémon lives in the wild.
While on the <color=#F01E1EFF>Cry </color>screen of a Pokédex entry,\nyou can listen to that Pokémon’s cry.\nShaking the <color=#F01E1EFF>Joy-Con</color> allows you to hear different\nsounds, like added reverberation or a chorus\neffect, so be sure to try it out.
Pokémon Centers
There are <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Centers</color> all over the\nSinnoh region.\nVisit a Pokémon Center to restore your tired\nPokémon to full health. These facilities are easily\nrecognizable by their distinctive red roofs.
You can use the <color=#F01E1EFF>PC </color>located in every <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon\nCenter </color>to access the <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Storage System</color>.\nFrom there, you can move your Pokémon into\nand out of <color=#F01E1EFF>Boxes</color>.
Pokémon Boxes
You can use <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Boxes</color> to swap Pokémon in\nyour party for Pokémon you left at a Pokémon\nCenter’s PC.\nTo access the Boxes, select <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon </color>from the\nmenu and then press the <color=#F01E1EFF>R Button</color>.
The Pokétch
The <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokétch</color> is a convenient and cutting-edge\ngadget designed to help out Trainers on their\nadventures. There are various Pokétch apps\nyou can use, such as the Digital Watch app\nand the Calculator app.
To use your <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokétch</color>, first press the <color=#F01E1EFF>R Button</color>.\nPress <color=#F01E1EFF>R Button</color> again to enlarge or reduce\nthe screen size.\nUse the <color=#F01E1EFF>Left Stick</color> to move the finger cursor,\nand press the <color=#F01E1EFF>A Button</color>, or directly touch the\nscreen, to control your apps.\nToggle through your apps with the <color=#F01E1EFF>red button</color>\non the right side.\nPress and hold the <color=#F01E1EFF>R Button</color> to close the Pokétch.
You will receive new Pokétch apps as you interact\nwith the many people you’ll meet across Sinnoh.\nSome of these apps are necessary to continue on\nyour adventure, so be sure to search far and wide\nfor them.
Hidden Moves
If you need to cut down a tree blocking your path,\nsmash a rock in your way, or fly to a familiar town,\nuse <color=#F01E1EFF>hidden moves</color> from an app on your <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokétch</color>.\nA wild Pokémon will come lend a helping wing or paw!
New hidden moves are added to the <color=#F01E1EFF>Hidden\nMoves </color>app on your <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokétch </color>when you obtain\ncertain TMs.\nIn order to use a <color=#F01E1EFF>hidden move</color> outside of battle,\nyou’ll have to earn its corresponding Gym Badge\nfrom the various Gym Leaders across the region.
Fishing
By facing a body of water and using your <color=#F01E1EFF>fishing\nrod</color>, you can go <color=#F01E1EFF>fishing</color>. When a Pokémon bites\nand “<color=#F01E1EFF>!</color>” appears, hurry and press the <color=#F01E1EFF>A Button\n</color>to reel it in.\nTry fishing in different areas to catch a wider\nvariety of Pokémon!
Bike Riding
Get on your <color=#F01E1EFF>bike </color>by selecting it from the <color=#F01E1EFF>Key\nItems </color>pocket of your Bag or by using a\n<color=#F01E1EFF>bike stand</color>.\nWhile riding your bike, you can ride over narrow\nlogs, but you can’t move through patches of\nextra tall grass.
Press the <color=#F01E1EFF>B Button</color> while on your <color=#F01E1EFF>bike </color>to change gears.\nYour bike is easier to control in <color=#F01E1EFF>third gear</color>, but in\n<color=#F01E1EFF>fourth gear</color>, it will gain speed and can even climb\nup steep, sandy slopes!
Walking with Pokémon
Even outside of Amity Square, you can take your\nPokémon on a walk—it’ll follow right behind you!\nJust select <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon </color>from the menu, choose one\nof the Pokémon in your party, and select\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Walk together</color>.
Making Poffins
<color=#F01E1EFF>Poffins </color>are a kind of Pokémon food made from\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Berries</color>. You can make Poffins at Hearthome City’s\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Amity Square </color>or inside the <color=#F01E1EFF>Poffin House</color>.
To make a <color=#F01E1EFF>Poffin</color>, put up to four <color=#F01E1EFF>Berries </color>into the\npot and stir them up, taking care not to spill\nor scorch.\nYou’ll create different Poffins depending on which\nBerries you used and how well you stirred them.
You can raise a Pokémon’s <color=#F01E1EFF>conditions</color>, such as\nCoolness or Cuteness, by feeding it <color=#F01E1EFF>Poffins</color>.\nRaising a Pokémon’s conditions may give it a\nbetter shot at wowing the audience in Super\nContest Shows!
Super Contest Shows
You can participate in a <color=#F01E1EFF>Super Contest Show</color> at\nthe <color=#F01E1EFF>Contest Hall</color> in Hearthome City.\nFour Pokémon will compete—with the three\nevaluation criteria of <color=#F01E1EFF>Visual</color>, <color=#F01E1EFF>Dancing</color>, and\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Moves</color>—to be named Star of the Show!
The <color=#F01E1EFF>Visual Evaluation</color> is based on a\nPokémon’s style.\nYou can earn a higher score by feeding your\nPokémon Poffins to raise its conditions and by\nusing Stickers to decorate its Ball Capsule.
The <color=#F01E1EFF>Dance Evaluation</color> tests your sense of rhythm.\nPress the <color=#F01E1EFF>A Button</color> to match the <color=#F01E1EFF>notes</color> that flow\nacross the screen in time with the music, and try\nto earn the best possible score: <color=#F01E1EFF>Brilliant</color>!

The <color=#F01E1EFF>Move Evaluation</color>  is based on your <color=#F01E1EFF>Contest\nMove</color>. Choose one of your Pokémon’s moves,\nnoting their various effects. You can only score\nwith this move <color=#F01E1EFF>once per contest show</color>—when the\nmoment feels right, that’s when it’s time to use it!
<color=#F01E1EFF>Super Contest Shows</color> aren’t just about competing\nwith the other contestants. You’ll want to work\ntogether to put on a successful show that really\nexcites the crowd!\nIf you really go above and beyond, the stage itself\nmight have a stunning surprise in store...
Changing Clothes
Pay a visit to the <color=#F01E1EFF>Metronome Style Shop</color> located in\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Veilstone City</color> to buy clothes and change your outfit.\nWhy don’t you pick out a style all your own? Then\nyou can change your look whenever the mood\nstrikes you!
The Explorer Kit
The <color=#F01E1EFF>Explorer Kit</color> contains tools you need to enter\nthe <color=#F01E1EFF>Grand Underground</color>. You can find it in the\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Key Items </color>pocket of your <color=#F01E1EFF>Bag</color>. Note that there are\nsome places, such as inside buildings, where you\ncan’t use it.
The Grand Underground
The <color=#F01E1EFF>Grand Underground</color> is a cavernous expanse\nlying just beneath the Sinnoh region’s surface.\nThe Underground is divided into several zones.\nWhich zone you enter depends on your location\nwhen you use the <color=#F01E1EFF>Explorer Kit </color>from the surface.
There are certain areas within the <color=#F01E1EFF>Grand\nUnderground </color>where Pokémon gather known as\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Hideaways</color>.\nDifferent Pokémon appear based on a hideaway’s\nsize and terrain, so keep searching and exploring!
There are certain points in the\nGrand Underground’s tunnels where you can try\ndigging for <color=#F01E1EFF>Fossils</color>.\nThese spots will light up on your radar when you\npress the <color=#F01E1EFF>R Button</color>.
In the <color=#F01E1EFF>Grand Underground</color>, you can set up your\nvery own <color=#F01E1EFF>Secret Base</color>. Just face a wall and use\nthe <color=#F01E1EFF>Digger Drill </color>to build it instantly! Feel free to\nplace <color=#F01E1EFF>statues </color>in your Secret Base and decorate\nit however you like.
Digging for Fossils
While <color=#F01E1EFF>digging for Fossils</color>, you can also find a\nvariety of other items and treasures. But each\ntime you dig, the cracks in the walls will grow\nlarger and larger, until the wall eventually\ncollapses. Dig carefully!
Use different tools to dig in the walls.\nThe <color=#F01E1EFF>pickax </color>only covers a narrow area,\nbut the cracks it forms are smaller as\na result. The <color=#F01E1EFF>hammer </color>forms large\ncracks, but it can cover a broader area.
Some walls are harder than others. You can tell\nhow hard a given wall is by the size and color of\nits stones.\nTake care—there are some parts of the walls that\nyou cannot dig through any further.
Sometimes, you may dig a <color=#F01E1EFF>stone box</color> out of the wall.\nThese stone boxes contain statues, which you can\nplace in your Secret Base to gain special effects!
Pokémon Hideaways
<color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Hideaways </color>are subterranean areas where\nPokémon feel comfortable gathering in the open.\nPokémon in the <color=#F01E1EFF>Underground </color>aren’t hidden by tall\ngrass. If you come into contact with a Pokémon in its\nhideaway, your battle will begin!
<color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Hideaways</color> range from dusty caves to\nstill-water caverns, attracting different Pokémon.\nThese hideaways can be found in differing sizes,\ntoo. Naturally, larger Pokémon prefer\nbigger spaces.
Your Secret Base
You can place any <color=#F01E1EFF>statues </color>you have acquired in\nyour <color=#F01E1EFF>Secret Base</color>.\nYou can even place your <color=#F01E1EFF>statues </color>on pedestals.
Placing a <color=#F01E1EFF>statue </color>in your <color=#F01E1EFF>Secret Base</color> seems to\naffect the number and kinds of Pokémon that\nappear within <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokémon Hideaways</color>.\nTry displaying various different statues to learn\nwhat sorts of Pokémon they attract.
If you upgrade your <color=#F01E1EFF>Secret Base</color> by increasing its\nsize, you’ll get more room to display <color=#F01E1EFF>statues</color>.\nTo get a bigger base, you’ll need a variety of\n<color=#F01E1EFF>spheres</color>, which can be found while digging\nfor <color=#F01E1EFF>Fossils</color>.
If you go down to the <color=#F01E1EFF>Grand Underground</color> while\ncommunications are activated, you might spot\nanother player’s <color=#F01E1EFF>Secret Base</color>. Try looking inside!\nYou can even use the <color=#F01E1EFF>menu </color>in another player’s\nSecret Base to activate the effect of its <color=#F01E1EFF>statues\n</color>for your own journey!
Ramanas Park
Lying at the end of <color=#F01E1EFF>Route 221</color>, <color=#F01E1EFF>Ramanas Park</color> is\nvisited by Trainers and Pokémon from all over.\nIt is said that Ramanas Park’s abundance of\nblooming roses attracts those with great strength,\nas it has since the Sinnoh region’s bygone days.
<color=#F01E1EFF>Mysterious Shards</color> that you dig up while in the\nGrand Underground can be traded for <color=#F01E1EFF>slates</color>.\nYou can then use these slates in various rooms\nat <color=#F01E1EFF>Ramanas Park</color>.
Each room at <color=#F01E1EFF>Ramanas Park </color>holds a <color=#F01E1EFF>pedestal</color>.\nIf you use the <color=#F01E1EFF>slate </color>that matches a given pedestal,\nyou may find yourself in a mysterious new space.\nIn these spaces, you can encounter\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Legendary Pokémon</color>!
The Union Room

The Great Marsh

Before starting the <color=#F01E1EFF>Safari Game</color>, use the\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Observatory Gate</color>’s second floor telescope.\nYou may see which Pokémon are in the\n<color=#F01E1EFF>Great Marsh</color> and spot a Pokémon that\nyou can’t find anywhere else in the region!
Stickers & Capsule Decoration
Place <color=#F01E1EFF>Stickers </color>on Ball Capsules to decorate your\nfavorite Pokémon’s Poké Balls. They’ll burst open\nbeautifully when your Pokémon jumps out!
From bursting heart shapes to showers of confetti,\nthere are many different kinds of <color=#F01E1EFF>Stickers\n</color>featuring all sorts of exciting <color=#F01E1EFF>effects</color>.\nJust remember that the motion a <color=#F01E1EFF>Ball Capsule\n</color>makes when it opens depends on the exact\nposition of any Stickers you placed.

There is a mysterious notebook here. Its age is\nimpossible to tell.\c\n“It was by pure chance that I obtained\ninformation about the Pokémon Rotom.\c\n“Remarkably, Rotom is able to merge with\nspecial motors.\c\n“Rotom can thereby enter various home\nappliances and change its form.\c\n“I have confirmed that Rotom changes its types\nand the moves it can learn by reflecting the\r\ncharacteristics of any home appliance it enters.\c\n“This Pokémon requires exhaustive observation\nand analysis.\c\n“To ensure I get all the credit, my Rotom\nresearch must be kept secret.\c\n“They will come to recognize me as the\nscientific genius Char...”\c\nThe rest of the notebook is blank.
Ah, imagine finding you here!\c\nYou must be eager to fill your Pokédex to be\nsearching even here.\c\nWhat am I doing?\c\nI visit a professor I know in Eterna every so often.\c\nHe tells me intriguing rumors of rare Pokémon\nsightings and such.\c
A Pokémon that slips into electric appliances,\nyou say...\c\nHmm... That is somewhat off from what I’ve\nheard about it.\c\nHmm... This is what I’ve heard.\c\nLong ago, there was a Pokémon that merged with\na toy robot.\c\nShould that Pokémon be recognized as a new\nspecies or not?\c\nDebates over the issue were about to start when\nthey were rendered moot.\c\nThe very topic of discussion—the Pokémon-\ninfused robot—disappeared...\c
It’s an old notebook. There’s no telling how old\nit is.\c\nWould you like to read it?
“Our encounter was a sudden one.\c\n“It was when I found my toy robot—one that I\nhad earlier misplaced.\c\n“At that instant, a Pokémon startlingly emerged\nfrom the lawn mower’s motor!\c\n“Clutching my robot, I stared, transfixed by the\npeculiar Pokémon.”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“The Pokémon hovered in the air, held aloft by a\npower unseen.\c\n“As if curious and unafraid of my presence, it\nfloated toward me.\c\n“Crackling sounds accompanied it, as if from\nstatic electricity in the air.\c\n“Remarkably, it seemed the Pokémon was the\nsource of this power!\c\n“In alarm, I flinched, certain that my face would\nbe subjected to a shock.\c\n“Much to my surprise, the Pokémon seemed to\nfavor me with a smile.”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“Finally, I came to realize that the Pokémon only\nwished to be friends.\c\n“I have decided to name this most wondrous\nPokémon ‘Rotom.’\c\n“Simple though it may be, Rotom emerged to me\nfrom the motor of a lawn mower.\c\n“‘Motor’ and ‘Rotom’... Surely the link\nis obvious?”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“Rotom is a Pokémon that is simply sensational.\c\n“The fact that it can turn invisible is simply\nthe beginning.\c\n“What makes Rotom unique is its ability to enter\nand operate machinery!”\c\nThis is about halfway through. Would you like to\nkeep reading?
“Rotom and I became fast friends. We were\nperpetual companions.\c\n“The electricity from its body forbade\ncontact, however.\c\n“We could not touch, let alone hug or hold\nhands, but we cared not.\c\n“For we were bonded on a much deeper,\nincorporeal level.”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“A feeling of mischief got the better of me\none day.\c\n“Seeing Rotom hovering, I decided to startle it.\nNormally I would not.\c\n“Perhaps frightened, Rotom discharged power\nbeyond its usual range.\c\n“I fell, stunned, into the arms\nof unconsciousness...”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“When I came to, to my horror I realized that\nRotom had disappeared.\c\n“I searched high and low for my friend in dismay\nand desperation.\c\n“‘Don’t chastise yourself.’\c\n“‘The fault is mine. No harm done.’\c\n“‘Let us play as we always have.’\c\n“Though my words poured out, my friend could\nnot be found to hear them...”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“My search for Rotom carried me far from home.\c\n“It was in the town’s rubbish heap that I again\nfound my old toy robot.\c\n“Curiously, our eyes met, then the robot waved a\nhand as if in greeting.\c\n“I knew then that I had found my lost friend.\c\n“I ran to it and hugged Rotom tight, talking on\nand on.”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
“The robot’s eyes lit up happily as I held it.\c\n“I’m certain that within it, Rotom was emitting\nlots of electricity.\c\n“Somehow, I felt I could understand Rotom’s\nthoughts better than before.\c\n“Also, I realized that we would remain friends\nthroughout our lives...”\c\nThe notebook ends with this page.
You used the [VAR 0109(0001)]!\c
It’s the entrance to a secret room!
Please select a Rotom.
Eligible
Ineligible
[VAR 0102(0000)] entered the motor.\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] is trying to\nlearn [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nBut [VAR 0102(0000)] can’t learn more than\nfour moves.\c\nWould you like it to forget a move to make room\nfor [VAR 0107(0001)]?
Would you like to give up on having this\nPokémon learn [VAR 0107(0001)]?
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not\nlearn [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] emerged from the motor.
Is it OK to forget the\nmove [VAR 0107(0001)]?
One...[WAIT 0.199999988]two...[WAIT 0.199999988]and...[WAIT 0.199999988][WAIT 0.199999988]ta-da!
[VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nAnd...
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned\n[VAR 0107(0001)] instead!
[VAR 0102(0000)] got inside the motor!\c
[VAR 0102(0000)] came out of the motor!\c
Anyway, this Rotom...\nWhat an interesting Pokémon.\c\nSo, you say it enters an appliance and essentially\nmerges with the device.\c\nIt may also learn new moves in the process.\c\nIn a way, I suppose it could be thought of as a\nmechanical Pokémon.\c\nHmm! Though it is utterly unique, it is undeniably\na species of Pokémon.\c\nFine, fine, so be it!\c\nNo matter how old one gets, there will always be\nnew Pokémon discoveries!\c\nTake care, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c

Hi! This is the registration counter for\npractice sessions.\c\nHere you can take Super Contest Show lessons.\nWould you like to practice?
In a Super Contest Show, four performers work\ntogether, acting in front of a large audience and\r\ndoing their best to put on a successful show!\c\nWhile performing, they’ll be evaluated in three\ncategories: Visual, Dance, and Moves.\c\nWe offer lessons to anyone who wants to enter a\nSuper Contest Show!
The Visual Evaluation will be based on the\nPokémon’s conditions and the spectacle of\r\nits customized Ball Capsule.\c\nThere are five types of conditions: Coolness,\nBeauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness.\c\nYou can raise each of these by giving your\nPokémon Poffins!\c\nCustomize your Capsule Decoration by placing\nStickers onto Ball Capsules. You can access them\r\nthrough the X menu or by using a PC.\c\nDifferent Stickers pair well with different contest\nshows, so try out a variety of them!
The Dance Evaluation is based on your\nrhythm skills!\c\nPush the button with the right timing as notes\nmove along with the music.\c\nScores for each note are divided into categories:\nToo Fast/Slow, Nice, Great, and Brilliant!\c\nThe better your timing, the more your Heart\nGauge will fill, and when it fills up completely,\r\nyou’ll get a <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>!\c\nA performance that earns a lot of <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s is definitely\na brilliant one! And that’ll be sure to send your\r\nDance Evaluation score sky high, too!\c\nCollecting <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s will also raise the Hype Meter\nshared by all four performers, pumping up the\r\naudience into a frenzy!\c\nPut on successful shows to earn hall points,\nand you can gradually upgrade the stage into\r\nsomething truly magnificent!
The Dance Evaluation is based on your\nrhythm skills!\c\nPush the button with the right timing as notes\nmove along with the music.\c\nScores for each note are divided into categories:\nToo Fast/Slow, Nice, Great, and Shining!\c\nThe better your timing, the more your Heart\nGauge will fill, and when it fills up completely,\r\nyou’ll get a <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>!\c\nA performance that earns a lot of <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s is definitely\na shining one! And that’ll be sure to send your\r\nDance Evaluation score sky high, too!\c\nCollecting <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s will also raise the Hype Meter\nshared by all four performers, pumping up the\r\naudience into a frenzy!\c\nPut on successful shows to earn hall points,\nand you can gradually upgrade the stage into\r\nsomething truly magnificent!
The Move Evaluation is based on a Pokémon’s\nContest Move, which the Pokémon can only use\r\nonce during the performance!\c\nContest Moves can have a variety of effects\nthat will help with the Dance Evaluation.\c\nChoose the move you’d like in advance at the\nreception desk, then use your Contest Move\r\nwhen you feel like the moment is right!\c\nBased on the success of your move, you may\nreceive <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s from the audience!\c\nAlso, if you coordinate with other performers and\nuse Contest Moves in succession, you can create\r\na Move Chain! Pull it off, and you’ll get more\r\n<color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s than if you’d just used a move on your own.\c\nIf you create a Move Chain with moves that have\nthe same type, you’ll get even more <color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>s.\c\nThe key to success is figuring out the perfect\ntime to use your Contest Move!
Please choose a Pokémon to enter, as well as its\nContest Move.
Would you like to cancel your practice session?
Please choose a Ball Capsule to use in\nthe Contest Show.

What a successful Super Contest Show!\nThe audience had a blast!
Hm?\c\nIt appears you don’t have any Pokémon with you\nthat are able to enter that contest show.\c\nPlease come back with a Pokémon wearing the\nContest Star Ribbon.
Which would you like to participate in?
Allow me to explain the rules of the Super\nContest Show!
The Super Contest Show begins with the\nVisual Evaluation.
It’s an evaluation of your Pokémon’s conditions,
and the spectacle of its customized Ball Capsule!
Next, the Dance Evaluation will begin.
Here, your Pokémon’s rhythm will be evaluated!
Notes will flow across the screen from the right.
Press the A Button just as they overlap with the\nscoring area!
Notes stretched out into a line are called\nlong notes.
Hold the A Button down for as long as the line\nstretches on.
If your timing is good as you hit the notes, your\nHeart Gauge will fill up.
Each time the gauge fills up completely, you’ll\nreceive one Hype Point (<color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>).
Just once during the Dance Evaluation,
you can press the X Button to use a\nContest Move.
Contest Moves can give you Hype Points (<color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>),
and if you use yours consecutively with\nother performers,
you can pull off a Move Chain and receive even\nmore Hype Points!
If the total of all four contestants’ Hype Points\n(<color=#F01E1EFF>♥</color>) reaches a certain quota,
the Super Contest Show will be a success!
Successful shows will earn you hall points,\nand as you collect more of those,
the Hall Rank will go up, and the stage will\ngrow fancier!
That’s all for the explanation. Would you like\nto try some practice?
Hm?\c\nIt appears that you can’t enter a contest show\nwith that rank.\c\nPlease come back after you’ve successfully\ncompleted a contest show at one rank below.

Hello there! It’s so very nice to meet you!\c\nWelcome to the world of Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
My name is Rowan.\c\nHowever, everyone just calls me the\nPokémon Professor.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
We humans live alongside Pokémon as friends.\c\nAt times we play together, and at other times we\nwork together.\c\nSome people use their Pokémon to battle and\ndevelop closer bonds with them.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
What do I do?\c\nI conduct research so that we may learn more\nabout Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now, why don’t you tell me a little bit\nabout yourself?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Tell me, what is your name?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Your name is [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
OK... So, you’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nA fine name that is!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
What might his name be?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0001)], is it?\nThat’s your friend’s name?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)], the time has come.\c\nYour very own tale of grand adventure is about\nto unfold.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
On your journey, you will meet countless\nPokémon and people.\c\nI’m sure that along the way you will discover\nmany things, perhaps even something\r\nabout yourself.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now, go on, and leap into the world of Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]

Look! These are Poké Balls! Let’s battle using the\nPokémon in them!\c
Will you choose the <color=#00965AFF>Tiny Leaf Pokémon</color>, <color=#00965AFF>Turtwig</color>?
Will you choose the <color=#F01E1EFF>Chimp Pokémon</color>, <color=#F01E1EFF>Chimchar</color>?
Will you choose the <color=#0064FFFF>Penguin Pokémon</color>, <color=#0064FFFF>Piplup</color>?
Which one do you want, then?
Hey, you saw that news report that was on\nTV, right?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You know, “Search for the Red Gyarados:\nThe Mysterious Appearance of the Furious\r\nPokémon in a Lake”?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
That show got me to thinking...\c\nI’ll bet our local lake has a Pokémon like that in\nit, too!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
So, that’s what we’re gonna do. We’ll go find a\nPokémon like that![VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey! Where are you wandering off to?!\c\nThat mystery Pokémon on TV! It’s calling out\nto me!\c\nForget about going back home!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Remember what your mother said?\c
“[VAR 0100(0000)]! Don’t go into the tall grass.\nWild Pokémon might attack you.\c\n“It would be OK if you had your own Pokémon,\nbut you don’t, so...”[VAR 0114(0003)]
Hey, it’s those people! Is that old guy staring\nat us?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hmm...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I heard from [VAR 0100(0000)] that you used our\nPokémon? Let me see them, please.\c\nHmm...\c\n[VAR 0101(0001)] and [VAR 0101(0002)]...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
...\c\nHmm, I see... That’s how it is...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m going back to my lab!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Um... O-OK! Professor, please wait for me!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I think you should visit our lab later.\c\nOK, see you!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Uh... Yeah, of course! Professor, wait for me!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
You should visit us at our lab later, I think.\c\nWe’ll be seeing you!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
What was all that craziness about?\c\nI mean, if he was angry, he could’ve just yelled\nat us, or whatever...\c\nAnd didn’t he want his Pokémon back?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
[VAR 0100(0001)]... We should go home, too...\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They can come\nbursting out at any time.\c
So, if you’re wanting to battle wild Pokémon,\njust walk in tall grass.\c\nIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon, then stay out\nof the tall grass.
Hi! I work at a Poké Mart.\c
Did you know that a Pokémon’s health is\nmeasured by Hit Points—HP for short?\c\nIf a Pokémon runs out of HP, it faints and can’t\nbattle anymore.\c\nIf a Pokémon’s HP gets low, you should heal it\nwith a Potion.\c
Here, let me give you some Potions as a sample.\nThese ones are free!\c\nThey will automatically go in your Bag’s\nMedicine pocket.\c
You can find a Poké Mart in cities and most\nmajor towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down for a shortcut\nto Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon’s health—its HP—is getting low,\nyou should go home and get some rest.
If your Pokémon’s health—its HP—is getting low,\nyou should go to a Pokémon Center!

[VAR 0100(0001)]?!\c\nDid you tell your family that you’re helping\nthe professor?\c\n...You didn’t, did you?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I know that you’re really eager to see all kinds of\nPokémon, but you shouldn’t make your mom\r\nworry that you’ve disappeared.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
You should go tell your family that you’re helping\nthe professor. The faster the better, too.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, that’s right!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], I haven’t shown you how to\ncatch a Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll demonstrate how to catch one, so just watch\nme, OK?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
*giggle*\nSee? Isn’t it neat?\c\nActually, it’s better to lower your target’s HP\nmore than I did.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s important to get the Pokémon’s HP down as\nlow as possible.\c\nA healthy Pokémon is very difficult to catch.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, Pokémon also get easier to catch if you\nmake them sleep or something by using a\r\nPokémon’s move.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
OK, [VAR 0100(0000)], to get you started, I’ll\ngive you some Poké Balls!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you have lots of Pokémon with you, it’ll be\nsafer on long trips.\c\nPlus, it’ll be a lot more fun having your\nPokémon friends along.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
OK, I need to get going. Bye, now!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0001)]?!\c\nDid you tell your family that you’re helping\nthe professor?\c\n...I bet you didn’t, did you?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know that you’re eager to see all kinds of\nPokémon, but you shouldn’t make your mom\r\nworry that you’ve upped and left.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Why don’t you go tell your family that the\nprofessor asked for your help?\c\nYou should do it right away.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0001)], do you know how to\ncatch a Pokémon?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll demonstrate how to catch one, so just\nwatch, OK?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
And that’s how it’s done.\c\nActually, I should have lowered the target’s HP\nsome more.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yup, the important thing is to lower the\nPokémon’s HP as much as possible.\c\nSee, a healthy Pokémon isn’t easy to catch.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, yeah. They also get easier to catch if you\nmake one of your Pokémon put them to sleep\r\nor such.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Here, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’ll give you some\nPoké Balls to get you started.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you have lots of Pokémon with you, you’ll be\nable to travel farther.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
That way, you’ll have a better shot at meeting\nmore Pokémon.\c\nSee you around!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Some Pokémon only appear in the morning.\nSome only come out at night.\c\nI’m going to keep waiting right here till I’ve\nseen every last one of ’em!

Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How’s your Poké Radar?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
When you use it, do you sometimes see more\nthan one patch of tall grass rustling?\c\nThe patch farther away gives you a better chance\nof seeing the same kind of Pokémon in a row.\c\nThat’s the feeling I get, anyway.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sometimes a patch of grass sparkles when a\nPoké Radar is used.\c\nPeople say a Shiny Pokémon is hiding there!\nCould that be true?[VAR 0114(0004)]

What the... Oh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nThat old guy... He’s not scary so much as he is\ntotally out there!\c\nAww, it doesn’t matter, [VAR 0100(0001)].\nI’m out of here. See you later!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Wow, what was that?\nYour friend sure seems to be really impatient.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, anyway... Let’s go inside.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
What was that?!\nYour friend always seems to be in such a rush.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Anyway... Let’s go in.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
OK, [VAR 0100(0001)], I’ll act as your mentor.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got a bit more experience than you as a\nTrainer and as the professor’s assistant.\c\nOK, follow me!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
This building with the red roof is the\nPokémon Center.\c\nIt’s the place that heals Pokémon that have been\nhurt in battle.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
You can find a Pokémon Center in most towns.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
The building with the blue roof over here is the\nPoké Mart.\c\nIt’s a shop where you can buy and sell items\nand medicine.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], since you’re a novice Trainer,\nyou won’t be able to buy many kinds of merchandise.\r\nDon’t let it bother you!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, that’s right! [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nDon’t you need to let your family know that\nyou’re going to be helping Professor Rowan\r\nwith the Pokédex?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
You may need to travel pretty far, so I think you\nshould let someone know.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but before you go, heal up your Pokémon at\nthe Pokémon Center.\c\nIt will be a lot less scary that way. OK, bye now!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI want to show you a few things.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, follow me!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
This building with the red roof is the\nPokémon Center.\c\nYou can get your Pokémon healed if it’s been\nhurt in battle.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll find a Pokémon Center in most towns.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Over here, the building with the blue roof is the\nPoké Mart.\c\nIt’s a shop where you can buy and sell all sorts\nof items.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], since you’re a rookie Trainer,\nyou won’t be able to buy very much stuff.\c\nDon’t worry about it, OK?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, yeah, right! [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nYou should let your family know you’re helping\nProfessor Rowan put together his Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
You may have to travel pretty far, so you should\nlet someone know.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, but first, go heal up your Pokémon at the\nPokémon Center.\c\nYou’ll be safe, then. OK, be seeing you!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, wow! Pokémon are so cool!\nI wish I had some!\c\nYou can help yours get stronger by having\nthem battle!
That thing you have—it’s a Pokédex, isn’t it?!\c\nNow you’re off to see all kinds of Pokémon!\nLucky you!
So I don’t forget what’s happened till now,\nI’d better save this...\c\nThere! Now I can take a break.

If a Pokémon loses all its HP, it can’t\nbattle anymore.\c\nI’m buying lots of Potions to avoid having\nthat happen!
If you come across a Pokémon you’ve just gotta\nhave, throw a Poké Ball!\c\nNever leave home without one!
Talk to that nice lady at the counter and hand\nher your Pokémon.\c\nShe’ll restore your Pokémon to perfect health in\nno time at all!
Do you see that PC over there?\nThat fancy blue one?\c\nIf you’ve got Pokémon with you, it’s free to use.
The Local Club is located at the top floor of\nany Pokémon Center.\c\nThere, you can have all sorts of fun with\nyour friends.
I feel nervous about going into the Local Room.
...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Finally, you’ve come. [VAR 0100(0000)], was it?\nLet me see that Pokémon again.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Hmm... I see.\nThis Pokémon seems to be rather happy.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Well well!\nYou’ve made your Pokémon evolve already?!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
All righty then!\nI’ll give that [VAR 0101(0000)] to you as a gift.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now that it’s yours, would you like to give it\na nickname?[VAR 0114(0001)]
Hmm, OK, I see.\nAnd you’re happy with that nickname?[VAR 0114(0001)]
Your friend [VAR 0100(0001)] told me what\nhappened at the lake.\c\nI heard you battled very well, despite it being\nyour first time.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
And, from what I can see, there is a growing\nbond between you and that Pokémon, though it\r\nis still young.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
That’s why I would like to entrust you\nwith [VAR 0101(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I’m so glad that you’re kind toward Pokémon!\c\nIf you weren’t, I’d have to... Oh, I just can’t\nsay it.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Am I ever glad you’re kind toward Pokémon!\c\nIf you weren’t, well...I don’t even want to think\nabout it.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Er-hem! Let’s move on to the main topic.\nThere is something I want you to do for me.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
My name is Rowan. I study Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
First of all, I want to know exactly what kinds of\nPokémon live in the Sinnoh region.\c\nTo do so, it is necessary to collect data using\nthe Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
This is what I wish to ask of you.\nI want to entrust you with this Pokédex.\c\nWill you use it to record data on all the Pokémon\nin Sinnoh for me?[VAR 0114(0001)]
...\c\n...\c\n...\c\n...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I can stand here without speaking for hours.\nI’m a very patient man.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Let me ask you again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI want to entrust you with this Pokédex.\c\nWill you use it to record data on all the Pokémon\nin Sinnoh for me?[VAR 0114(0001)]
Hm! Good answer!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
You obtained the <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokédex</color>!
That Pokédex is a very high-tech device.\c\nIt will automatically record data on every kind of\nPokémon you encounter.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], I ask that you go everywhere\nand meet every kind of Pokémon in this region!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I’ve got one, too!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got the same kind of Pokédex as you.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
When you walked up Route 201 with your\nPokémon, what did you feel?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I’ve lived for 60 long years. Even now, I get a\nthrill when I’m with a Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now, you should know that there are countless\nPokémon in this world.\c\nThat means there are just as many thrills waiting\nfor you out there!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now go!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], your grand adventure begins\nright now!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Go on!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], your grand adventure\nawaits you![VAR 0114(0001)]
The Pokémon that I used for the first time\nwas [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nIf you would have chosen [VAR 0101(0001)] at\nthe lake, we’d have the same Pokémon now!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Not that it matters, but...\c\nAnyways, I’m Dawn.\c\nI also help the professor add pages to\nthe Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
So, in a sense, I’m just like you.\c\nI just got a little head start on you, that’s all.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll be happy to teach you things. Glad to meet\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
The professor asked me to help, so I’m going to\ngo out and fill the Pokédex pages, too.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
That makes us comrades working toward the\nsame goal.\c\nI’ll teach you stuff later, OK?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m [VAR 0100(0000)]’s father.\c\nI’ll be happy to assist you on your quest for\nthe professor.\c\nHahaha. Eh... I’m sure we can count on you!
Professor Rowan invented a new Pokédex\nwhile working alongside a professor from\r\nthe Kanto region!

There’s a lot of reference material and research\nreports on Pokémon.
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve come to show me your progress on\nthe Pokédex?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Hmm...\c\nSo, you’ve seen [VAR 0202(0000,tagParameter=205)] Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
What’s wrong? You’re not going to tell me\nyou’ve seen too few to bother showing me?[VAR 0114(0001)]
Bravo, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve recorded all the Pokémon of Sinnoh in\nyour Pokédex!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
This will help immeasurably with my studies on\nPokémon Evolution...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Hm! [VAR 0100(0000)], I’ve been waiting to\nsee you!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
You’ve met every kind of Pokémon there is in the\nSinnoh region!\c\nThis will help immensely with my studies on\nPokémon Evolution...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Greetings, Professor Rowan! It’s been a very\nlong time!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll tell you, Sinnoh certainly is a long trip\nfrom Kanto.\c\nOf course, if it means meeting new Pokémon,\nthere’s no distance too great for the likes of us\r\nto travel.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! If it isn’t my old colleague, Professor Oak!\c\nI should have expected as much from the world’s\nauthority on Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
We always used to joke, “Where there are\nPokémon, you’ll find Oak!”\c\nIt’s good to see that hasn’t changed one bit!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Professor Oak, let me introduce you to my\nyoung assistant.\c\nThis youngster has filled every page of the\nSinnoh Pokédex for me.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Ah, well, very glad to meet you! As you’ve heard,\nmy name is Oak.\c\nI’ve been hearing a great deal about you from\nProfessor Rowan lately.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
He’s been exuberant in praise about a fantastic\nyoung Trainer.\c\nI see that you live up to—no—that you’ve\nsurpassed his praise.\c\nYou’ve also got an impeccable sense of timing.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
You see, I had an errand to run for Professor\nRowan on my visit here. He’d asked me to bring\r\nthe data for the National Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
So, since you’re here, let me upgrade your\nPokédex with the National Mode.\c\nAfter all, there are many kinds of Pokémon in this\nworld of ours!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Your Pokédex was upgraded with the\nNational Mode!\c
I’m afraid it won’t be easy to complete the\nNational Pokédex. However, I’m sure you will\r\nmake an honest attempt on our behalf!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Have no fear. [VAR 0100(0000)] will get the\njob done.\c\nBy the way, Professor Oak, what compelled you\nto visit this region?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Ah, yes. I’ve heard that Ramanas Park is now\nopen. If I remember correctly, it’s at the end\r\nof Route 221.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ramanas Park has a special system that\nattracts every imaginable kind of Pokémon\r\nfrom every region.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve come to make certain that system is\noperating properly.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you should make an effort to\nvisit Ramanas Park, too.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oops! I’ll be late for my meeting if I don’t\nget going!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, it was a pleasure seeing the both of you!\nBye now!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you should make an effort to\nvisit Ramanas Park, too.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]

Off he goes, as busy as ever...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Now, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI have a gift here as your reward for completing\nthe Sinnoh Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
That’s the Pokémon Radar—or just Poké Radar\nfor short.\c\nUse it, and it will indicate grass patches where\nPokémon are lurking.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I’d prepared that to help my field assistants put\ntogether the Sinnoh Pokédex, but you took care\r\nof that!\c\nI’m sure it will be useful for your goal of filling\nthe National Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0001)]
The world is immense. There are many\nmore Pokémon.\c\nThat means there are many more thrills for you to\nseek and enjoy![VAR 0114(0001)]
You checked the PC.\c\nThe screen is filled with special terms and\nacademic writing that is impossible to figure out.
The refrigerator is filled with tasty\nsweets! Mmm...
It’s really quite something! Imagine... Cataloging\nevery kind of Pokémon in the Sinnoh region!\c
And in complete contrast,\nthere’s [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nAnyway, you’ve been great for the prof’s\nPokémon Evolution research!
Yes, that’s correct.\c\nProfessor Rowan has been studying Pokédex\nsystems with Professor Oak.
Ah, so that Rowan fellow is back?\c
He’s quite the remarkable man. He’s been\nstudying Pokémon since way, way back.\c\nMy son and grandchild help Rowan with his\nstudies now.
Oh my! You’ve got a National Pokédex?\c
How fantastic is that?!\c\nRowan should be delighted. It will greatly help\nhis research.\c
But, young Trainer...you should know this.\c\nIn this world, there are three hundred...\nNo, four hundred... No, no, no! There’re a lot\r\nmore kinds of Pokémon than that!
Who are you?\c\n...\c\nOh... You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
Hey, you’re doing that Pokédex thingy for\nthe professor!\c\nWow! That’s the same as my big sister! Go for it!
Who are you?\c\n...\c\nOh... You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
You’re doing that Pokédex thingy for\nthe professor!\c\nWow! That’s the same as my big brother!\nGo for it!
Oh, hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThere was news on TV saying there is a massive\noutbreak of Pokémon!\c
That’d be great for filling up your Pokédex!
Let me see... What did that news say now...?\c\n[VAR 0105(0001)]! They said there’s\na whole bunch of [VAR 0101(0002)] there!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], you have to hurry!\c\nI want you to do better than my sister Dawn!

What was that about?!\c\nOh, hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI’m going to the lake! You should come, too!\nAnd be quick about it!\c\nOK, [VAR 0100(0001)]? I’m fining you 1 million\nif you’re late!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]

That’s a Guidebook. Take a look at it when you\nare curious about something or have questions\r\nduring your adventure. You may find an answer.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Gee, a journey full of adventure...\nI envy you, kiddo.\c\nPlus, you’re not alone. You have your Pokémon\nwith you. I wish I could go instead!\c[VAR 0114(0008)]

Oh? No, he’s not...\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh... Then he must have left already...\nWhat to do...\c[VAR 0114(0007)]
That boy shouted about going on an adventure,\nthen he bolted.\c\nHe’s so headstrong and reckless... I at least\nwanted him to take this...\c[VAR 0114(0007)]
Not to worry. [VAR 0100(0000)] will deliver that\nto him.\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
Won’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, really? You’d do that for me?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], please take this to\n[VAR 0100(0001)] for me.\c[VAR 0114(0007)]

Let me think... Knowing my boy, he would\nprobably head straight to Jubilife City...\c\nOK, please take that to my [VAR 0100(0001)].\c[VAR 0114(0007)]
Bye-bye, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nEnjoy your adventure!\c[VAR 0114(0008)]

That concludes our special report, “Search for\nthe Red Gyarados!”\c\nBrought to you by Jubilife TV on Nationwide Net!\c
See you next week—same time, same channel!
The TV is showing the title screen of a\nvideo game.
The X Button opens the menu!
It’s the latest game console—a Nintendo Switch!
You checked the PC.\c\nPokémon Basics...\c
People live alongside Pokémon in this world.\c\nThe people that battle Pokémon are called\nPokémon Trainers.
You’re off to hang with [VAR 0100(0000)] again,\nright? You two sure are tight!
I went on an adventure with some Pokémon a\nlong time ago.\c\nIt was only to the next town, though.\nYeah, good times...
Did you hear? The Pokémon Professor returned\nto the next town over.\c\nThey say he was gone for four long years.\c\nI wonder if he found some amazing Pokémon\nwhile he was gone?
Well! Professor Rowan gave you a Pokédex,\ndid he?
Listen, listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I want a\ncute Pokémon!
Listen, listen, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nDo you think I can be friends with Pokémon like\nyou are?
Hi, [VAR 0100(0001)]! Are you catching Pokémon?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Wow! You’ve already got [VAR 0200(0000,tagParameter=205)] Pokémon with you!\c\nAt that pace, your Pokédex should be full in no\ntime at all!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Um...\c\nI think you’d feel a lot safer if you were to catch\nsome more.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
In Jubilife City, there’s the Trainers’ School,\nwhich... Well, you know.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you should visit it. You’ll get\nsome tips on Pokémon.\c\nOh yes, [VAR 0100(0001)] went to the Trainers’\nSchool earlier. OK, bye now!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]! How many Pokémon have\nyou caught?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! You already have [VAR 0200(0000,tagParameter=205)] Pokémon with you!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? I think you should catch some more.\c\nIt might be more of a challenge raising a lot\nof Pokémon...\c\nBut it’s worth it. The more Pokémon you have,\nthe happier you’ll be.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
In Jubilife City, there’s the Trainers’ School.\nCheck it out, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nOh yeah, [VAR 0100(0001)] went to the Trainers’\nSchool earlier.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
OK, see you around! Work hard on your Pokédex!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Jubilife City is built on land carved out of a\nmountain. The people and Pokémon of\r\nOreburgh City helped out with that undertaking.
Hello! Let me ask you, have you paid a visit to\nthe TV station?\c\nIf you’ve never been, you owe it to yourself to\nmake the trip.\c
And, if you’ve been there before, it never hurts\nto visit again.\c\nAfter all, you can be a star!\nOr at least dream of being one!
By the way, have you visited the\nTrainers’ School?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must visit there!\c
By the way, have you participated in the\nPokétch campaign?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must try!\c
Hey, you! Yes, you with that cool scarf!\c\nYou should have seen the boy who came running\nby earlier. He ran past me so quickly that I\r\ncouldn’t even manage a hello.
Jubilife City is a big place.\nTake your time sightseeing.
By the way, have you visited the\nTrainers’ School?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must visit there!
By the way, have you participated in the\nPokétch campaign?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must try!
Oh? You are a Pokémon Trainer?\c\nBut you don’t have a Pokétch yet?\c
Pokétch is short for Pokémon Watch!\c\nOh my, you are a rare case indeed!\c
You see, I invented, and now manufacture,\nPokétches. Not only that, I’m now conducting\r\nthe Pokétch promotional campaign!\c
All you have to do is find three clowns in\nJubilife City. If you can find them...\c\nI’ll give you your very own Pokétch!
The three clowns will each ask you a\nsimple question.\c
The questions will all have to do with Pokémon—\nAfter all, a Pokétch is a tool designed for\r\ndevoted Pokémon Trainers!\c\nCollect a Coupon from each clown,\nthen come see me, OK?
OK, let me count your Coupons! I’ll just pull out\nmy Pokétch here and...\c\nOne...two...three! Bravo! I say, bravo!\c
In return for these Coupons, I present you with\nthis Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch for short!\c
You received a <color=#F01E1EFF>Pokétch</color>!\c
You can add apps to your Pokétch to make it\neven more versatile!\c\nPlease press the R Button and try it out!\c
Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s “rollout” my question!\c\nDoes a Pokémon grow by defeating others and\ngaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating other\nPokémon in battle.\c\nSome Pokémon even change into a different\nPokémon through a process known as Evolution.\c
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!\c

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s “rollout” my question!\c\nJust like Pokémon, do the moves of Pokémon\nalso have types?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
If a Pokémon’s type matches the type of a move\nit uses, that move is made much more powerful!\c

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s “rollout” my question!\c\nCan a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item.\c
Some items become effective as soon as they are\nheld by a Pokémon.\c\nBerries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary\nduring battle.\c
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!\c
Hi there. You should stick around.\nWe’re doing a Pokétch campaign soon.\c\nBefore it starts, I think you should brush up\nat the Trainers’ School.

Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nImpeccable timing, as always.\c\nThese miscreants are babbling utter nonsense\nthat I just can’t stomach.\c\nShow them some manners, if you will.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Oh, Professor, must you be so difficult?\nWe are approaching you strictly as businessmen.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
All you must do is provide us with all your\nresearch findings.\c\nIn return, we’ll see to it that your assistant\ndoesn’t become collateral damage.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
[VAR 0100(0001)], let’s battle together and\nteach these losers a lesson!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0001)], let’s battle together and\nteach these losers a lesson!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
You leave us no option. We will retreat for now.\c\nBecause Team Galactic is benevolent to all,\nwe shall leave.\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
So...\nThey call themselves Team Galactic, do they?\c\nWhen Pokémon evolve, they seem to release\nsome sort of energy.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I believe it’s a mystic power far beyond our\ncontrol. But Team Galactic seems to be trying\r\nto harness that power for something...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Anyway, [VAR 0100(0000)], well done!\nYou battle quite capably.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Seeing you Trainers battle side by side with\nyour Pokémon only makes me more confident\r\nin my decision to entrust you with a Pokédex!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0001)], did you know?\c\nThe professor studies the Evolution of\nPokémon, too.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon\nare somehow tied to Evolution!\c\nI guess that means some Pokémon must undergo\nstartling Evolutions.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
So, [VAR 0100(0001)], let’s keep working on our\nPokédex project for the professor!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh, that was very good! Nicely done!\nTruly excellent!\c
Oh, I beg your pardon! I’m from Jubilife TV.\c\nI’d like you to have something for letting me see\nthat smashing battle!\c
That look... You’re obviously a Trainer!\nWill you tell me what type of Pokémon you like?
Fire-type Pokémon?\nYou must have a fiery personality.
A person who likes Water-type Pokémon must\nbe pretty cool.
You chose Grass-type Pokémon?\nNo wonder you look so calm.
Did you see me on TV? I was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon,\nthey gradually grow friendlier.
One, two, three, four, five...six!\nThat should do it.\c\nYou can only have six Pokémon in your party\nat a time.
Hiya, where’d you come from?\c\n...\c
Twinleaf Town, huh...\nIt’s a nice place—quiet and all.\c\nJubilife City is a big place, so it might be a bit of\na shock to you.
Hello, Trainer!\nDo you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see! You’re quite well versed indeed!\c\nI imagine you wouldn’t see the need to visit the\nTrainers’ School, then.\c\nBut do visit if you have the time. You may\ndiscover something new!
Oh, so you’re not very familiar with Pokémon...\nWell, don’t worry!\c\nYou can go visit the Trainers’ School, where\nyou’ll learn all about the basics of Pokémon.
Just past here is the GWS, which stands for\nGlobal Wonder Station.\c
Oh, you don’t have any Gym Badges.\c\nThe GWS is off-limits if you haven’t earned a\nGym Badge yet. Sorry!\c

Trading Pokémon means connecting with friends,\nboth old and new. That’s awesome!

I gave my Pokémon an item to hold before\ntrading it.\c\nThat will make the other Trainer double happy!

You obtained [VAR 0202(0001,tagParameter=205)] [VAR 014D(0000)]!
You can’t carry any more Stickers.
If you want to catch a Pokémon, you should try\nto lower its HP first.\c\nIf you don’t, Poké Balls won’t be very effective.
I need Potions most of all!\c\nIf all my Pokémon faint, I completely black out!
You know how Pokémon have types, like Water,\nFire, and Grass?\c\nThey say that types have strengths and\nweaknesses against other types.
In the Local Room upstairs, you can battle and\ntrade with other people.
You can still catch Pokémon if you already have\nsix traveling with you.\c\nA new Pokémon can be sent to a Pokémon Box!\c
Knowing that, I can keep on catching more and\nmore Pokémon!\c\nIt’ll make it more fun to check my Boxes!

Oh, you can be sure I’ll keep developing\nPokétch apps.\c\nJust like Pokémon, my Pokétch is something\nthat evolves!

I really don’t win many battles. But it doesn’t\nget me down.\c\nI’m trying for the world record at\nPokémon fishing!
Sorry, I’m still fine-tuning this thingy here.
You can see the rankings of people in your\ngroup here.\c\nIt makes me try even harder ’cause I can’t stand\nlosing to my friends!
These rankings are nifty!\c\nI’m going to make a group and compete with all\nmy best friends!
Sorry, I’m still fine-tuning this thingy here.
Hello. Thank you for visiting us today. To which\nfloor may I take you?
1F\n2F\n3F\n4F\nNever mind
I look forward to serving you again.
Certainly. Elevator going up.\c
Certainly. Elevator going down.\c
Sorry, we are already on that floor.
Here we are!
Pokémon are wonderful, deeply\nmysterious creatures.\c\nBut to Trainers, it seems the only thing that\nmatters is battling!
Hello there, Trainer!\c\nIf you get stumped and don’t know what to do...\c
Talk to people! Talk to everyone you see!\c\nGo places! Go wherever you can!\c\nYou’ll find many new places by doing just that.
Did you know?\c\nSome kinds of Pokémon evolve when they get\nstronger from battling!\c\nWhen they evolve, they can take on completely\ndifferent appearances!
Evolution makes Pokémon just that much\nmore fascinating.
When I give my Pokémon nicknames, it’s like\nthey’re my very own.\c\nIt gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling!
Isn’t my Pokétch quite fetching?\c\nA Trainer would be simply lost without a Pokétch,\nafter all.
Piika pi![VAR 0114(000B)]
Pachipachii?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, your Pokémon is quite adorable!\c\nHere, try making it hold this\n[VAR 0109(0000)].\c
A Pokémon holding that Quick Claw can\nsometimes attack first, even if it is normally a\r\nlittle bit slow.\c
There are other items that are only useful when\ngiven to a Pokémon.\c\nTry finding other items that you can make your\nPokémon hold.\c
I sound like I’m a teacher or something.
I like making my Pokémon use their attacks.\c\nSometimes, when Pokémon get stronger, they\nlearn new moves.\c
Those new moves keep things fresh and are a fun\ndistraction for me!
Did you buy some Heal Balls at the Poké Mart?\c\nA Heal Ball completely heals the Pokémon it\ncatches on the spot.\c
That means you can catch a Pokémon and have\nit battle ready right away.\c\nI wonder what kind of healing space it is inside\na Heal Ball...


That’s a big globe, eh?\c\nWhere do I live on it now? Let’s see if I can\npoint it out...
Global Wond...\nGlobal Wonde...\r\n...\r\nGlobal\r\nWonder\r\nStation!\c\nPhew...\nWhat a long and difficult name!
If I keep doing Wonder Trades many many times,\nsomeday I’ll complete my one-and-only globe.\c\nIt’s my dream to gaze upon it!
You can easily trade Pokémon with Pokémon fans\naround the world.\c\nIsn’t that something?
When I imagine that the Pokémon I’ve raised\nwill be recorded on another person’s globe,\r\nmy eyes tear up...
It makes me a bit nervous to trade Pokémon with\nstrangers, but it makes me excited to think that\r\nI can meet Pokémon I’ve never seen before.
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the Global\nWonder Station!\c
Welcome to Geonet, the high-tech globe!\c
What would you like to do?
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you come to\nstudy, too?\c\nI went ahead and memorized everything that was\nup on the blackboard.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
After all, it’s the Trainer’s job to avoid having\ntheir precious Pokémon hurt in battle, right?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
So, [VAR 0100(0000)], what brings you here?\nYou’ve got something for me?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You delivered the Parcel.
So, what is this?\c\nScore! It’s a Town Map!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Huh?! Why are there two in here?\c\nI like it a lot, but I don’t need two.\nHere, [VAR 0100(0000)], you take one!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You obtained a <color=#F01E1EFF>Town Map</color>!
Hmm...\c\nWell, according to the Town Map, I guess\nOreburgh City is where I should be going next.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
There’s a Gym, so it’d be perfect for raising the\nPokémon I just caught.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Well, I’m on the road to becoming the greatest\nTrainer of all time!\c\nSee you around!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You just became a Trainer, did you?\c\nYou should look up topics that you’re not\nfamiliar with.
We learned about Pokémon types today. Umm...\c
Grass is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and\nWater is weak to Grass! I think that’s how it goes!
Pokémon are smart enough to use items\nthey’re holding.\c\nBut they won’t know what to do with\nhuman-made items like Potions and Antidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on what makes\na true Pokémon Trainer.
The blackboard lists status changes that may\naffect Pokémon in battle.\c
Which status would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP.\nThe effects of poison remain after a battle.\c\nHeal a poisoning using an Antidote.\c
Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.\c
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.\c
Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce its HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.\c
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\c\nIt may thaw out on its own, but if the battle\nends first, it will remain frozen afterward.\c\nYou can thaw it out using an Ice Heal.\c
It’s a notebook filled with writing. Let’s see...\c
Pokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls.\c\nUp to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer.\c
A Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon,\nraises them, and battles with them.\c
A Trainer’s mission is to defeat the strong\nTrainers who await challengers in Pokémon Gyms.
I got my Pikachu by trading from a distant land.\c
He grows quickly and his level’s high, but he\ndoesn’t listen to me.\c\nIt’s not always easy, but Pikachu is still my\nirreplaceable partner!
Pikapikapikaaah![VAR 0114(000B)]
If everyone around the world had Pokémon...\c\nthen everyone around the world\ncould communicate!
We came here because I wanted to see the place\nwhere the Pokémon I got from a trade grew up.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I think about my friends every time I see the\nPokémon I traded with them![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can trade Pokémon with people around the\nworld using the Global Wonder Station, right?\c\nJust hearing that gets my heart racing.\nSuch exciting times!
When you connect with people on the internet,\nit’s hard to tell if the world’s big or small.
Oh, lookie there! You’ve got a Pokétch!\c\nHmm... You’re still a pretty new Trainer,\naren’t you?\c
But it’s all good! You’re a new fellow friend\nof Pokémon!\c\nSo, let me make a gift of these Technical\nMachines to you!\c
Each of these TMs contains the move\nRock Smash.\c\nFYI, when you use a Technical Machine to teach\nyour Pokémon a move, that TM will then break.\r\nSo think very carefully about when to use it.\c\nI’ve also added a new feature to your Pokétch,\nrookie Trainer!\c
But to use this hidden move in the field, you’ll\nfirst need the Gym Badge from Oreburgh City.\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing your growth!
Oh! Good golly!\nThat’s Oreburgh City’s Gym Badge!\c\nAll right! Now you can use the hidden move\nRock Smash on small boulders!
Do you see those slanted rocks on the ground?\c\nIt feels awesome taking those fast on a bike.
Hi! How’s it going?\c\nYou’re in the [VAR 0123(0001)] group with\n[VAR 0100(0000)] as the leader, right?\c\nWould you like to leave that group and join\nanother one?

Hi! I know it’s a little sudden, but would you like\nto join a group?\c\nIf you join a group, you can compete or\ncooperate with fellow members. It’s a lot of fun.\c\nWant to join?\c
Which group would you like to join?
Oh. That’s too bad.
Oh, you want to make a new group? Sure thing!\c\nThe group you made before will be disbanded,\nthough. Is that OK?
Cool! What do you want to name your group?
The [VAR 0123(0000)] group, huh?\nThat’s a great name!\c\nYou lead this group.\nI hope they get more members!
The [VAR 0123(0000)] group?\n[VAR 0100(0001)] is the leader.\r\nWould you like to join this group?
OK! You are now a member of the\n[VAR 0123(0001)] group.
Mix your records in any Local Room, and you’ll\nbe able to join a group of friends you met there.\c
When you’re in the same group, events can\nhappen simultaneously.\c\nIt makes things a lot more fun playing in a group!\c
Anyone can make a group, and anyone can join.\c\nI hope you recruit lots of friends so everyone\ncan have fun!
I want to make a group

Route 218\nCanalave City
Route 218\nJubilife City
Route 218 up ahead is a great fishing hole that’s\nalmost unknown to people.
Yes, sir! An Old Rod is a good thing! You think so\ntoo, am I right?
Yes! Good answer! We can be friends!\c\nHere you go. That’s my [VAR 0109(0000)]!\c
You should fish wherever there is a body\nof water.\c\nOh, and by the way, did you need any tips on\nusing that fishing rod?
Oh, really? You don’t like to fish?
First, you face any body of water. Then you use\nyour fishing rod. Next, you focus!\c\nIf a Pokémon bites, an “!” appears. That’s your cue\nto reel it in!
The first hurdle when you’re fishing for Pokémon\nis getting a bite.\c\nThen you’ve got to battle the Pokémon after you\nreel it in. So, fishing gives you twice as much fun!
Gee, I sure am thirsty...
[VAR 0100(0000)], long time no see!\c\nOh? You look puzzled. You’re wondering who\nI am.\c
I’m Professor Rowan’s assistant and\n[VAR 0100(0001)]’s father.\c\nThe professor asked that I upgrade your\nPokédex, you see. So I’d chosen this spot on a\r\nhunch that you’d pass through.\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], may I have your Pokédex\nfor a moment?\c

Let’s see... Was I supposed to put in the\nsoftware here...?\c\n*ka-chunk*\n*ka-chunk*\c
...Hm? It looks like your Pokédex doesn’t need\nupgrading. It already lets you toggle between\r\nimages of male and female Pokémon.\c\nTechnology sure has improved lately!
OK, I’ll leave you to carry on with your project\nfor the professor.\c\n...May I also ask you to keep an eye on\nTeam Galactic?\c
The professor is concerned about what happened\nin Jubilife City...\c\nIt’s probably nothing to worry over! I’ll be on my\nway now.\c
Hey! [VAR 0100(0001)]! Tell me you got a\nlittle tougher!\c\nMe? Do you even need to ask? Of course I\ngot tougher!\c\nCome on! Let’s battle it out!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Waaah! What do you mean I lost?!\c\nWell, that’s it! That’s the last time I’ll ever lose!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I’m going to be the world’s toughest Trainer,\nand you know it!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
The first thing to do is take on the Oreburgh\nCity Pokémon Gym! I’m gonna toughen up for\r\nthat, totally!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Did you know?\c\nThe first Pokémon to appear in a battle is the\none at the top of your team list.
Route 203\nJubilife City
Route 203\nOreburgh City
Trainer Tips!\c\nIf a Pokémon is about to evolve, it can be\ninstantly stopped.\c\nPress the B Button during Evolution to startle the\nPokémon into stopping.\c\nThat is how Evolution can be canceled.
Trainer Tips!\c\nPokémon moves use energy called Power Points—\nor PP for short.\c\nTo replenish PP, head for any Pokémon Center.
Hunh?\c\nOh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0001)]! You finally got\nhere? You’re slow like always.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You’re so slow, the Gym Leader’s long gone now.\c\nHe said he had to go to... Uh... Oh yeah—\nto Oreburgh Mine!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I got my Badge already, so it’s no big deal to\nme, but...[VAR 0114(0002)]
I told you—the Gym Leader isn’t here.\c\nIf you want to challenge the Gym, you’d better\ngo down to the mine and ask him.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
But, wow, a Gym Leader is in a different class of\ntoughness. Even I’m feeling run down.[VAR 0114(0002)]
<size=250%>*thud*</size>\c
Whoops! [VAR 0100(0001)]! You got the Gym\nBadge, huh?\c\nEterna City is the next place with a Gym that\ngives away Badges, right?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
So, yeah, I went to Route 207, but you can’t go\nthrough it without a bike.\c\nI made my team battle and toughened them up,\nso it wasn’t a waste.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
So, I’m going back to Jubilife City. Next stop,\nthe Eterna Gym Badge!\c\nTen seconds before I dash!\c\nNine...\c\nBah! Who’s got time to count?!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Howdy, Trainer!\c\nIf you don’t have a single Gym Badge, other\nTrainers will look down on you like you’re a\r\ntotal noob, right?\c\nSo, I’ll show you where the town’s\nPokémon Gym is.\c
Huh? There’s someone there.
Is that guy in front of the Gym your friend?\nHe’s sort of twitchy and impatient.
Oh, hi—you’re back! The Gym Leader’s waiting\nfor you.
Can I see your Trainer Case?\nThe Gym Badge you just won is in it, right?
The Gym Leader went off to work in the mine.
The Gym Leader is young, but he’s the safety\nsupervisor of the mine.\c\nHe’s an expert in more than just one field!
Everyone’s proud of the mine.\c\nThey’re digging for coal under the sea as we\nspeak... It’s amazing how they do it!
Up ahead there’s a huge mountain that towers\nabove everything.\c\nIt divides Sinnoh into two distinct halves.
Have you seen the vents? They release steam\nfrom down below.
These vents exchange the hot air down below\nwith fresh air from outside.\c\nLooking down them gives me the urge to start\nyelling into ’em! Hello!
There’s no question that this is hard, hard work.\nBut working alongside Pokémon... It gives me a\r\nboost somehow. Here, take one of these.\c
Feeling hale and hearty puts a smile on my face.\nAnd that makes me happy.
This pile of dirty sand is called a slag heap.\c
It’s the waste from sorting coal.
Chop, chop, Machop!\nChop, chop away on rocks! ♪
There are a lot of different TMs.\c\nIt’s tricky trying to decide which Pokémon should\nlearn what moves.
When I run around with my Running Shoes on,\nit feels like I’m the center of attention!

The Badges that Pokémon Gyms give you are a\nmeasure of a Trainer’s worth.\c\nBy getting more Badges, you get to buy more\nitems in Poké Marts.
The Poké Mart girls are so pretty! They leave\nme tongue-tied...\c
It’s lined with colorful binders.
It’s chock-full of Pokémon books and\nphoto collections.
Pokémon magazines!\c\nPokémon Pal... Pokémon Handbook...\nAdorable Pokémon...
The trash can is empty.
The shelves are jammed with colorful\nPokémon goods.
There are eight Gym Leaders in the\nSinnoh region.\c\nThe objective for Trainers is to get Gym Badges\nfrom them all.
A Gym Leader isn’t just like any Trainer\nyou meet.\c\nI’d take as many Pokémon as possible if I\nwere you.
Roark lets us train our Pokémon in the mine.
Giving nicknames to Pokémon is the way to go.\nIt makes you feel as if they’re your very own.
He named our Psyduck “Yellow” just because of\nits color...\c\nI don’t understand the logic behind that at all.
Are you catching Pokémon? Here, take this if\nyou’d like.\c
The Dusk Ball is a Poké Ball designed for use\nin darkness.\c\nIt works better if you use it at night or in a cave.
Duuuck?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Do you have your Pokémon hold items? If you’d\nlike, let one hold this [VAR 0109(0000)].\c
That [VAR 0109(0000)] intensifies the\npower of Rock-type moves.\c\nUnfortunately, none of my Pokémon can use\nRock-type moves, so...
Duuuck?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks to the Gym Leader, we can\nplay underground.
Listen, listen—do you have a Pokémon\ncalled Machop?\c\nWould you be willing to trade your Machop for\nmy Abra?
Be nice to my Abra! I’ll be sure to look after your\nMachop in return!
What I asked for was a Machop...
Oh, OK... Well, I can’t make you trade me.\c\nBut if you change your mind, I’ll be right\nhere waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be friends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade grows quickly.\c\nBut if a Pokémon grows too much, it will often\nignore the Trainer.\c
Of course, that won’t matter if you have a lot\nof Gym Badges.
All Pokémon have a special power called\nan Ability.
How my Pokémon and I are alike...\c\nIt’s not anything I can explain easily.
The view is good from up here, but it’s a pain\ngoing out.\c\nIf you don’t mind, how about showing me a\nPokémon called Zubat?
The view is good from up here, but it’s a pain\ngoing out.\c\nIf you don’t mind, how about showing me a\nPokémon called Zubat?\c

That does it! I’ll go out and catch Pokémon, too!\c\nThank you, my friend! This is a token of\nmy thanks!\c
Yeah, there are so many kinds of Pokémon out in\nthe world. I want to see them all now!
During the daytime, everyone goes off to\nthe mine.\c\nAt night, everyone’s at home getting some\nwell-deserved rest.
We’ll keep digging coal. The world needs energy!
Everyone, including lots of Pokémon, dug the big\nunderground maze!
Roark is a user of Rock-type Pokémon.\c\nDon’t you think Rock-type Pokémon are nice?\nI like how lumpy they are!
Roark is our town’s Gym Leader. He may be\nyoung, but he keeps the mine running safely\r\nand efficiently.
Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh\nMining Museum!
Hello, hello! How are you?\nI study Pokémon Fossils! Me! Right here and now!\c
You have a Fossil for me, yes? Shall I turn it into\na Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back into a Pokémon?\nChoose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil back into a\nPokémon, surely I will!
You don’t wish that I extract any Pokémon from a\nFossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting your Pokémon\nfrom a Fossil.\c\nYou go outside, yes, please. Now! Time alone is\nwhat I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long! You kept us\nwaiting! Unacceptable!\c\nThis is your [VAR 0101(0000)]! You be good to\nit! OK!\c
You received [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c
Would you like to give a nickname to the\n[VAR 0101(0001)] you received?
But, no, I cannot do this! You have too many\nPokémon with you!\c\nI must hold this Pokémon for you, so come back,\nyou, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain, bring it to me if\nyou must.
On the verge of a breakthrough, I am, to achieve\nextraction from Fossils.\c\nFrom Fossils I can extract Pokémon, but not yet,\nnot yet.
Whoa! So this is coal? I never expected\nsomething this big!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this must be\nterribly strong!
Well, how about that! Oreburgh Mine extends\nunder the seafloor!
How Coal Is Made: Part 1\c\n“In a time long before history, vegetative matter\nwas swept along by rain and rivers. It came to be\r\nburied under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made: Part 2\c\n“The buried plant matter was forced ever deeper\nunderground due to tremors and fissures\r\ncaused by the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made: Part 3\c\n“Deep underground, the plant matter was\nsubjected to heavy pressure and the heat\r\nof magma. It gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions\nare displayed.
The box contains categorized samples of coal.
Different kinds of lamps are displayed.\c\nThey appear to have been worn on someone’s\nhead while the person was underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are displayed.\c\nThey apparently dug out coal using these tools in\nthe olden days.
The everyday items and tools of past mine\nworkers are displayed.
Have you ever seen or heard about Shiny\nPokémon? They have different colors than usual.\c\nFor instance, Pikachu is usually yellow, correct?\c\nWell, Shiny Pikachu is sort of orange.
You know how Pokémon have different Natures\nlike we have personalities?\c\nI don’t think it’s surprising to see Pokémon in\ndifferent colors.
Pikaaah![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hiya! Your Pokémon could use some\ntoughening up.\c\nWhy not try training in Oreburgh Mine?
I always have a rotten time trying to decide\nwhich moves my Pokémon should learn.

Oreburgh Mine is operated with the utmost care.\c\nWe avoid causing any damage to the natural\nhabitats of Pokémon.
Wow, your Pokémon’s eyes are twinkling brightly!\c\nSeeing that makes me happy! Here, I want you to\nhave this!\c
You know how Pokémon stay inside their\nPoké Balls?\c\nI try to think about what would be the best\nPoké Balls for them.
The whole system of taking the coal out of the\nmine is automated.\c\nThere’s nothing backbreaking about it!
The coal mine here’s fully automated.\c\nCoal mining was brutally hard in the old days,\nbut not anymore!
You remind me so much of the time I got my\nfirst Pokémon.
You’re taking a tour of our coal mine?\nWonderful! That’s excellent of you.\c\nIt’s always good to learn about new things and\nbroaden your horizons!

This is embarrassing...\c\nI went and lost to a Trainer who didn’t have a\nsingle Gym Badge...\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
But that’s the story. You were strong,\nand I was weak. That’s all there is.\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
According to Pokémon League rules, I have to\ngive you our Gym Badge since you’ve beaten me,\r\nthe Gym Leader.\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
Here’s your official Pokémon League\nCoal Badge.\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
You received the Coal Badge from Roark!
Having that Coal Badge means you can now use\nthe hidden move Rock Smash from your Pokétch.\c\nYou should also take these, too.\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
Each [VAR 0109(0000)] contains the move\nStealth Rock.\c\nIt’s a move that inflicts damage on opponents\nthat switch into battle.\c[VAR 0114(0011)]
Incidentally, a TM will teach its move to a\nPokémon instantly.\c\nBut a TM will break when you use it, so be\ncertain you want a Pokémon to learn that move.[VAR 0114(0011)]
In this region of Sinnoh, there are seven other\nGym Leaders.\c\nI should warn you—they’re a lot tougher than\nI am![VAR 0114(0011)]
Howdy! How’s it going, Champ-to-be?\c\nThat’s what I said to a really impatient boy\nearlier, too.\c
The Gym Leader is a user of Rock-type Pokémon.\c\nWell, listen. Rock-type Pokémon really hate\nwater, all right?\c
They’re also weak to Grass-type moves.\nGee, they sure have weaknesses!\c\nBut don’t think it’ll be easy. You don’t get to be\na Gym Leader without covering for weaknesses.\c
Going after a Rock-type Pokémon with a\nFire-type Pokémon won’t be easy, either.\c\nThat’s all the advice I can give.\nThanks for listening!
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve taken care of the\nGym Leader!\c\nSo, did my advice come in handy or what?\c\nIf my advice was useful, it’d be great if you’d\nbecome my fan!

Switch on the PC at any Pokémon Center and\nconnect to the Pokémon Boxes.\c\nThat’s all you need to do to store or bring out\nyour Pokémon.\c\nYou may be able to access the Pokémon Boxes\nfrom the menu screen!
Welcome! I’m here to help you with your\nappearance for the Union Room.\c\nWould you like to select a Trainer appearance?
Which kind of Trainer would you like to\nappear as?
Is the [VAR 010E(0000)] look OK?
Thanks! I’ll make sure you’re set up with the\n[VAR 010E(0000)] look.\c\nI hope you enjoy your time in the Union Room!
Understood.\c\nPlease enjoy your time in the Union Room!
If you’d like to change your appearance for the\nUnion Room, talk to the receptionist to the left\r\non the second floor.
You have no room in your Explorer Kit.
Before I enter the Global Room, I take a deep\nbreath and ask myself: do I want to battle today?\r\nOr do I want to trade?
There are boulders blocking the way inside\nthe cavern...\c\nI think a hidden move in the Pokétch would be\nable to break those boulders, though.
Route 204\nJubilife City
Ravaged Path
Are you raising different kinds of Pokémon?\c\nIf you only have one type of Pokémon, you’ll\nhave a hard time against types it’s weak to.
Hi! I teach at the Trainers’ School, and I’d like to\ngive you a special lesson.\c\nBut before I do, I want you to have these TMs.\c
When you get snarled at, you wince a bit.\nIt’s the same for Pokémon.\c\nThe move Snarl lowers the target’s\nSpecial Attack, or Sp. Atk for short.\c
You also probably know this, but a TM is good\nfor only one use.\c\nChoose the Pokémon wisely if you do decide to\nuse it.
Route 204\nFloaroma Town
What?! No way! You have the key?\c\nLocking the door was meaningless! I am the loser\nin this after all!\c\nThis is no time for self pity! I’ve got to alert\nthe commander!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
My Pokémon can’t battle anymore.\c\nThey’re gonna take away my Pokémon for\nmessing this one up...\c\nHumph! Just you wait! Our commander will\nsmoosh you![VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m one of Team Galactic’s three commanders.\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
We’ve been trying to create a new world that’s\nbetter than this one...\c\nBut people have shown little understanding\nabout what we do.\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
You don’t understand either, do you? It’s a\nlittle saddening...\c\nSo, let’s have a battle to decide what we should\ndo next.\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
If I win, you leave. If you win, we, Team Galactic,\nwill leave!\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
Oops! I messed that one up!\c\nThat’s all right, though. I quite enjoyed\nour battle.\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
I guess it’s time to say good-bye and leave for\nthe time being!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
Team Galactic...\c\nThey were saying they had to gather Pokémon\nand energy no matter what.\c\nIt was for creating a new universe, or so\nthey claimed.\c\nNothing they said made any sort of sense to me.\c
Anyway, I can’t tell you how grateful I am to you\nfor saving me.\c\nI can finally see my little daughter again!\c
Papa!\c\nYuck! Papa, you’re stinky! Go shower now, stinky!\c[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, sorry! Ahaha! They had me working nonstop!\c[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thank you, Trainer! You made those bad people\ngo away!\c\nI think the balloon Pokémon will come\nvisiting again![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon appears in front of\nthe Valley Windworks.\c\nIt’s always a certain day of the week, but I’m not\nsure which day.\c[VAR 0114(0014)]
Could its appearance have something to do with\nthis windworks using wind-generated energy?[VAR 0114(0014)]
The Valley Windworks uses turbines to capture\nenergy from winds blown from the mountains\r\ndown to this canyon.\c\nWe produce energy from the power of nature\nitself. It’s quite wonderful.[VAR 0114(0014)]
If the balloon Pokémon came, the wind would\nblow it away![VAR 0114(0013)]
Aren’t we Team Galactic? And we’re\nassigned here?\c\nStanding around among flowers... This doesn’t\nseem all that cool.\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey now! Don’t complain. This is a pretty decent\nassignment. But Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon\r\nso creep me out...\c\nI don’t like being here, either.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I wanted to get some flowers from\nFloaroma Meadow...\c\nBut some Team Galactic guys in snazzy outfits\ncame along...\c
Those Galactic guys went to the meadow past\nthese flowers here...
Being surrounded by flowers puts me in an oddly\npleasant mood.
I simply love it here... The atmosphere is\nso uplifting.\c\nYou came to get emotionally healed too,\ndidn’t you?
Welcome to Floaroma, the town of flowers,\nflowers, and more flowers!\c\nYou should plant some flowers of your own, too.\nYay for flowers!
Berry trees are profoundly interesting.\nIf you grow them with care, they will bear\r\ngreat Berries.
I got drawn here by the sweet scent of Honey...\c\nSeriously, what’s that? What am I? A Pokémon or\nsomething? Mmm... Honey.
Floaroma Town\nVivid & Scented

If I dress up and go to the TV station in Jubilife\nCity with my Pokémon, can everyone in the\r\nregion see my Pokémon?
You can’t buy Berries or Ribbons at Poké Marts.
If you’ve got Pokémon with you, it’s safe for even\na kid like you to go off traveling alone.
I had a battle the other day, and my Pokémon’s\nHP got low. I thought we were done for...\c\nBut then, all of a sudden, my Pokémon ate the\nBerry it was holding! Whew!
We’re kinda close to Eterna City, but it’s still\nquite far away.\c\nYou should be prepared for a long journey.
A single Berry will grow into a plant that makes\nseveral Berries.\c\nBy planting one, there will be more and more\nBerries in the world.\c\nI hope you will help us spread more\nBerries everywhere!\c
Please come by again tomorrow. I’ll pick a\ndifferent Berry for you.\c\nPlease plant that Berry in soft, earthy soil!
Trainer, please water Berries using this Sprayduck\nwatering can.\c
Use that Sprayduck to water the soil where\nyou’ve planted Berries.\c\nYou should also water Berry plants while they\nare growing.
Hello! Would you like to exchange your Berries\nfor some Stickers?
Some kinds of Pokémon appear only if they’re\nattracted by the sweet scent of Honey.
Pokémon must have an acute sense of smell.\c\nThey can sense the aroma of Honey from very\nfar away.
Floaroma Town was a barren, desolate hill\nlong ago.\c\nPeople started planting flowers on it because it\nwas such a sad place.\c
But nothing would grow... People didn’t know\nwhat to do...\c\nAnd then one day, someone expressed thanks for\nthe blessings of nature.\c\nThen, the whole hill burst into bloom. Isn’t that\nstrange and wonderful?
Do you think it’s cute how Pokémon\npluck Berries?
Yes! You agreed! Here are some TMs for the\nmove Pluck!\c
Oh...\nI guess I just like weird things...
When a Pokémon uses Pluck, it eats a Berry held\nby its opponent in battle.\c\nI like how it steals a Berry. It’s so cute!
Rii?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Enough arguing! Hand over that sweet Honey!\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
Do as we say!\nTeam Galactic will have that Honey!\c\nWe must have it to attract Pokémon in\ngreat numbers!\c[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hey! This kid is a witness! What’ll we do?\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
We can’t have the brat running off to get help.\c\nThe solution’s simple... We must ensure the brat\nstays quiet!\c[VAR 0114(0017)]
This is so lame...\nThey’re going to dock my pay!\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m up next! Heheheh...\c\nBattling you right after my cohort has weakened\nyou gives me the edge!\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
This brat’s tough! Like, really, really tough!\nTougher than I can put into words, and I know\r\na lot of words!\c\nWe’re done for now... Let’s get back to the\nValley Windworks.\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, what’s this thing? They seem to have\nforgotten it...\c\nIt’s a Works Key... It must be for the\nValley Windworks!\c\nIt’s of no use to me. You may as well have it.\c
Thank you! You surely saved me.\c\nThose goons were trying to rob me of my sweet,\nsweet Honey.\c
They sure were weird, though. You saw how they\nwere dressed.\c\nWhat they were saying didn’t make a whole lot\nof sense, either.\c\nOh! I need to thank you! Will you take this as\nmy thanks?\c
If you slather that Honey on a sweet-smelling\ntree, it might attract Pokémon.
Honey can attract Pokémon if it’s slathered on a\ntree and left a while.\c\nWould you like to buy some Honey for a\nmere 100?
Oopsy! You can’t hold any more.
Oopsy! You don’t have enough money.
Oopsy! Well, come again.
The flowers that grow in the fields here\nare special.\c\nDo you see how they’re more vivid than flowers\nelsewhere in Sinnoh?\c\nYou can thank Pokémon for that.
If you put Honey on a tree, check back later to\nsee if the tree is rustling.\c\nIf I see rustling, it gets my hopes up because\nthere’s a good chance there is a rare Pokémon.
Don’t you dare go into the Valley Windworks.\c\nI got orders to keep everyone out if they’re not\npart of Team Galactic.\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
You’re giving me a look that makes me think\nyou’re gonna try to get in.\c\nOK, then. You’ll have to battle me for it!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
Isn’t that just great. Getting owned by some kid.\c\nBut you can’t do a thing if I lock myself in with\nmy Works Key!\c\nThat’s right, the other Works Key’s not here!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
My cohorts in the flower patch have the only\nother one!\c\nHahaha! In that sense, I’m no longer the loser!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
*ker-chunk*\c
It’s locked from inside!
It’s locked from inside!\c\nWould you like to use the Works Key?

Help, help, Trainer!\c\nPlease, can you get my papa for me?\c
He works at the Valley Windworks.\c\nBut the people dressed like space aliens are\nmean and won’t let me in...
Please, Trainer! Get my papa from the\nValley Windworks!
We, Team Galactic, are conducting research in\nEterna Forest! This is as far as you will go!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
Our research involves catching Pokémon in the\nflowery meadows of Floaroma Town.\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
We are also using the energy of the\nValley Windworks for something.\c\nBut that is of no concern to you!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]

Many Poison-type Pokémon make Eterna Forest\ntheir home.\c\nBut I didn’t buy any Antidotes. What should I do?\nDo I press on, or do I go back?
If you slather Honey on a sweet-smelling tree...\nPokémon may be attracted by that sweet scent.

Trainer Tips!\c\nThe items placed in your Bag are automatically\nsorted to the appropriate pockets.\c\nIt’s very convenient! It’s a Trainer’s best friend!
You seem to be tired...\nRest a while.
You and your Pokémon look\ncompletely refreshed!
Just because you’re young doesn’t mean you\nshould push yourself.

OK, so your name is [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’m sincerely glad to meet you.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], may I ask you a big favor?\c[VAR 0114(0018)]
I want to get through this forest, but I’m afraid\nof doing it alone.\c\nI’ve heard that there is a sinister group of people\ncalled Team Galactic about.\c[VAR 0114(0018)]
I think there’ll be safety in numbers.\nPlease, may I go through with you?\c[VAR 0114(0018)]
You decided to go with Cheryl!

My Pokémon got poisoned, and now it\ncan’t battle.\c\nI knew I should’ve loaded up on Antidotes at the\nPoké Mart!
The rock is covered in moss.\nIt feels pleasantly cool.
Hiya! Were you intrigued by the rumors going\naround, too?\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
You know, people’ve been talking about the\nghost Pokémon of the Old Chateau.\c\nI’ve been hearing rumors about sinister\nshadows, too.\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
I should check it out myself, but going in\nthere is...\c\nWell, you know, being that I’m a Gym Leader,\nI’m always busy.\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
So, since I’m so busy, I can’t go in.\nIt’s not because I’m s-scared!\c\nS-so, good luck with your investigation!\c[VAR 0114(001D)]

But you don’t want to listen to me whine.\nHere’s a souvenir!\c[VAR 0114(0019)]
My ironworks would be nothing if there were\nno iron.\c\nThat’s why I’m always thankful for nature\nsupplying me with iron.[VAR 0114(0019)]

I went to the Trainers’ School around here.\nStudy there, and you may come out stronger.
Oh! You know about Capsule Decoration, too?\c\nAs a Trainer who studied in the Trainers’ School,\nI’ll give these to you.
Yes, yes. You do look a bit stronger.\c\nKeep working toward that dream of becoming\nan Ace Trainer!
The GWS connects people all over the world.\c\nI told that to my Budew, and now it looks\nso happy!

Hey, you actually came!\c\nWelcome once more to Oreburgh Gym.\c\nEver since the day I lost to you, I’ve been\nrethinking everything I know about the strengths\r\nand weaknesses of Rock-type Pokémon...\c\nOver and over and over... And then it hit me—\nRock-type Pokémon are simply the best!
Thanks for coming to see me!\c\nLet me show you again just how strong Rock-type\nPokémon are!
I’ve gotta hand it to you... I gave that battle all\nI had, but you still beat me fair and square.\c\nI can see how you made it into the Hall of Fame.\nYou really are a top Trainer!

Here’s the Sticker I always use. Now you can use\nit too, if you want!

I see you’re adventuring with Pokémon. I’m sure\nyou’re making many lovely memories together.
It looks like you’ve played Let’s Go in\nKanto before.
Would you like to ”go” on an adventure in\nSinnoh with this Pokémon?
Oh dear. It appears you can’t accept any\nmore Pokémon.
I’m sure it will be a good partner to you.
Please try to take very good care of Mew,\nthe New Species Pokémon!
Oh, you there...
You seem to be really enjoying your adventure\nwith your Pokémon!
And I gather you’ve seen a Wishing Star before.
Would you mind taking this Pokémon? I think it\nwould be perfect for you.
Oh my. Apparently you don’t have room for any\nmore Pokémon.
I wish you and this Pokémon the grandest of\nadventures together!
Take good care of Jirachi, the Wish Pokémon.
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’re forgetting something important.

All right. Let me know if you change your mind.
You’d rather not, after all? Well then, just let me\nknow if you change your mind.
You’d like your fortune told again?\c\nGiven your birthday of [VAR 0201(0000,tagParameter=205)]/[VAR 0201(0001,tagParameter=205)]...\c\nAha! Today’s fortune is once again a happy one!\c\nPlease enjoy your fresh and floral day!

OK—hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’ll be sure to\nremember that name!\c\nMy name is Cynthia. I’m a Trainer just like you.\c\nI’ve been studying Pokémon mythology lately,\njust out of curiosity.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
Here in Eterna City, there is a statue of an\nancient Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
According to myth, it was an extremely\npowerful Pokémon.\c\nWho knows? You may encounter something like\nit while you’re traveling with your Pokédex.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Try using these. They should help you on\nyour way.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Remember, you can use the hidden move Cut\nfrom your Pokétch in the field.\c\nIt will let you go places that were previously\ninaccessible to you.\c\nThat’s important for filling up your Pokédex,\nright? Then luck be with you, young Trainer!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hey! You there, kid! Stay away from that\nPokémon statue!\c\nTeam Galactic is conducting an official\ninvestigation here![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer!\c\nErrr... It’s OK. Never mind. You look tough.\c\nI won’t take— Um, I’ll just let you keep your\nPokémon. Carry on![VAR 0114(000A)]
Have you seen our building?\c\nTeam Galactic is so stinking rich that we can\nhave one built instantly![VAR 0114(000A)]
Since that Team Galactic building went up,\nthe city’s atmosphere has gotten all creepy\r\nand tense.\c\nI don’t know what those people are doing up in\nthat place...
With Team Galactic gone, what’s going to\nhappen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his favorite\nPokémon away. I don’t think he’s telling the truth.\c\nTeam Galactic looks so cool. They don’t look like\ncommon ruffians.
Do you use bike stands?\c\nIt looks so cool to hop off your bike and then\nlean on it. It looks so smooth!
Since you’re visiting Eterna, you need to\nget yourself a bike and take a ride down\r\nCycling Road.
They say this is an old city.\c\nIt doesn’t look it, though. Not with all these\ntall buildings.
Eterna City’s not anything like it was before, way\nback in the day.
They say this is a Pokémon that lived long,\nlong ago.
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have an Explorer Kit?\c\nYou should have a word with the man next door\nto the Pokémon Center.\c
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have an Explorer Kit?\c\nYou should have a word with the man next door\nto the Pokémon Center.
Going underground with the Explorer Kit is a\nblast, isn’t it?
Oh wow! You got a bike!\c\nYou can ride down Cycling Road and end up in\nHearthome City.\c\nIt’s a fast and fun ride. You should check it out!\c
Oh wow! You got a bike!\c\nYou can ride down Cycling Road and end up in\nHearthome City.\c\nIt’s a fast and fun ride. You should check it out!
It feels great riding a bike with the wind in your\nface, doesn’t it?

After all, to be strong, you need to raise\ndifferent types of Pokémon!
When a Pokémon faints, use a Revive on the\nPokémon. It’ll be able to battle again!
Team Galactic took my Pokémon away.\nThey took other people’s, too.\c\nSomething should be done, but Team Galactic\ncreeps everyone out...\c\nWhat are they doing to my Pokémon?
I got my Pokémon back!\c\nI’m so happy, I feel like riding my bike down\nCycling Road together with it!
Bunbun![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hi, you cute little Trainer! What kinds of\nPokémon are with you?\c\nThis Pokétch app will show how close your\nPokémon feel to you.\c
If you spend enough time with them, all Pokémon\nwill open up to you.
Hi, you cute little Trainer! What kinds of\nPokémon are with you?\c\nOh, your [VAR 0101(0000)]...\c
It seems to like you. It must be happy being\nwith you.
It’s becoming comfortable around you, I think.
Hmm... It needs to get used to you more.
Multi Battles are the ultimate in pulse-\npounding action!\c\nYou won’t know how exciting they are until\nyou’ve actually experienced one!
Thanks for rescuing me. I can’t thank you enough!\nSay, let me give you a bike to show my gratitude!\c
It’s the latest model, so I’ll read the operating\nmanual to you.\c\n“Press the B Button to shift gears,” it says.
“In third gear, the bike cannot reach full speed,\nbut it will be easier to handle. In fourth gear,\r\nit can ride at full speed and climb up slopes.”\c\nYour bike can take you through all sorts of towns,\nroads, and routes. Now get out there and ride!
Pip piih![VAR 0114(0015)]
The manager’s gone off to the Team Galactic\nbuilding and hasn’t returned.\c\nI wonder what’s holding him up.
What was Team Galactic trying to do with other\npeople’s Pokémon?
There is a manual on the latest model of bicycle.\c\nThird gear for steering.\nFourth gear for all-out speed!\c\nChange gears with the B Button for\nexhilarating cycling!
There’s a catalog on bikes...\c\nThe Mach Bike—a folding bike built solely for\nblazing speed!\c
The Acro Bike—a folding bike designed for stunts\nlike jumps and wheelies!
Welcome to Team Galactic. Are you here to\ndonate your Pokémon?\c\nWhat? You’re not? Then kindly get off\nour property!\c\nDo we have to bring the pain like we did with\nthe Cycle Shop manager?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Team Galactic isn’t interested in the world. Our\ngaze is beyond the stars![VAR 0114(000A)]
Team Galactic is working hard to find new energy\nsources for the future![VAR 0114(000A)]
We are conducting research on new forms\nof energy! We want to harness the mysterious\r\npower of Pokémon![VAR 0114(000A)]
Ordinary people like you can’t understand\nTeam Galactic’s grand designs!\c\nCome to think of it...I don’t even know what’s\ngoing on...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Eh? Did you want something?\c\nHow silly of me to even ask. You want to free the\nPokémon. Yeah, that’s gonna happen!\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
Well, aren’t you tough...\c\nIt’s OK, though. Our official Pokémon-statue\ninvestigation is finished.\c\nAnd Mars has collected energy from the\nValley Windworks.\c[VAR 0114(001C)]
We’re pretty much finished here. I’ll let you in on\none little thing.\c\nOur boss is researching the myths of ancient\nPokémon. With the power of mythical Pokémon,\r\nhe will become the ruler of Sinnoh...\c[VAR 0114(001C)]
I suggest you keep out of Team Galactic’s affairs\nfrom now on.\c\nThis is your last warning!\c[VAR 0114(001C)]
Pi...[VAR 0114(0015)]
What is it with this Team Galactic?\c\nWhy did they take our Pokémon? What are they\ntrying to accomplish?
I got my Clefairy back, and it’s all thanks to you!\nBut that Team Galactic...\c
They said, “Clefairy came from space. Hand\nit over!”\c\nTheir logic baffles me still. It’s like they are\nfrom space!\c
Anyway, they’re gone now. Thank you very much!\c\nI can’t thank you enough right now, but cruise by\nmy Cycle Shop, OK?\c
Myun...[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hello, hello! I am the official Name Rater!\c\nWant me to rate the nicknames of\nyour Pokémon?
Which Pokémon’s nickname should I critique?
[VAR 0102(0000)], is it? That’s a\ndecent nickname!\c\nBut would you like to give it an even\nbetter name? How about it?
Ah, good. Then what shall the new nickname be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nThat’s a better name than before! How fortunate\nfor you!
I see. Please come visit again.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nThe name looks no different from before, and\nyet it is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!
[VAR 0102(0000)], is it? That is a truly\nimpeccable name!\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Now, now. That is merely an Egg! An Egg can go\nby no other name!
Excuse me, but do you got that Pokémon\nnamed Buizel?\c\nWanna trade it for my Chatot?
Yes! So awesome! A Buizel! I promise I’ll be good\nto it!\c\nPlease take good care of the Chatot I gave\nyou, too!
What I totally want is a Buizel...
Oh, OK. Totally got it. It’s all right if you don’t\nwant to.\c\nBut if you change your mind, let’s totally trade\nsome Pokémon.
We traded Pokémon, so we’re friends now!\nPlease take good care of the Chatot that I\r\ngave you!

Welcome to the Herb Shop, home of effective\nyet inexpensive medicine.
Herbal meds work most impressively. But your\nPokémon won’t like them. They’re horribly bitter\r\nand smelly!
Someone ought to invent herbal medicine that\nisn’t bitter.\c\nThat would be a medical breakthrough!
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you! How is your\nPokédex coming along?\c\nCatching every kind of Pokémon is no easy feat—\nI’ll grant you that.\c\nBut I’m sure you can accomplish it!\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, yes!\c\nAn acquaintance from Kanto has sent me\nsomething quite interesting.\c\nI think you’d make better use of it than I\never could.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I understand there is a Pokémon that evolves\nwhen it is traded while holding that Upgrade.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Eterna came to be long ago in honor of an\nancient Pokémon.\c\nThough many things have changed, what is\nimportant has not. I hope it remains that way\r\nforever more...
Have you seen the Pokémon statue?\c\nWhen I was a wee child, it used to be the\ncenterpiece of many festivals...
At my Gym, no one gets to battle with the\nGym Leader—me—until they’ve beaten all the\r\nother Trainers.\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the back.\nGood luck, challenger!\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
Hey there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be?\c\nActually, that’s what I said to some boy who\nzipped in here earlier, too!\c
The Gym Leader, Gardenia, is a user of\nGrass-type Pokémon.\c\nIt should be obvious, but Grass-type Pokémon\nreally hate fire.\c
Oh, wait a second. I should tell you about the\nGym itself first.\c
You can’t challenge the Gym Leader until you\nfind and beat all the Gym’s Trainers, who’ve\r\nhidden themselves.\c\nIt’s a bit challenging, but just think of it as good\ntraining and go for it!
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve beaten the\nGym Leader!\c\nYour Pokémon look much tougher than when they\nwent in, too! At least that’s how I see it!

My hunch was right on the money. You have a\nwinning aura about you.\c\nSo, anyway, this will be fun. Let’s have our battle!\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
I might’ve said it before, but you’re really tough!\c\nWasn’t it hard for you to raise your Pokémon to\nbe so good?\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
I guess that’s a measure of how much you love\nyour Pokémon.\c\nIn recognition of that, I proudly grant you this!\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
You received the Forest Badge from Gardenia!
With the Forest Badge, the hidden move Cut will\nbe available from your Pokétch.\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
Now that you have two Gym Badges, all\nPokémon you received in trades will obey\r\nyou up to Lv. 30.\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
I’ve also got something else for you. These are\na gift from me!\c[VAR 0114(001D)]
Each [VAR 0109(0000)] contains [VAR 0107(0001)].\nIt’s one of my favorite moves.\c\nThe heavier the opposing Pokémon, the more\ndamage this move will cause.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Yup! If there’s one thing I can tell about you,\nit’s this—you and your Pokémon are gonna get\r\neven tougher, and I mean seriously![VAR 0114(001D)]
How did you know where to find me?\nLet’s have our battle!\c
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past the two\nboulders... I think.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some\nserious special attacks.\c\nI won’t let you win easily!\c
Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer...\c\nIn the middle of three trees. That’s it for my hint.\nGood luck!
Even when you try to conceal it, you can’t hide\nthe aroma of flowers.\c

I am the first one to have started digging out the\nGrand Underground.\c\nI am! You can call me the Underground Man.\nEveryone else does.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ll make a gift of this to you. You hold up your\nend of the deal and put it to good use!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
My gift to you, the Explorer Kit, will instantly\ntake you to the Grand Underground!\c\nYou need only to use it, and you will be down in\nthe tunnels and caverns beneath our feet.\c\nUnderground lies a different world where you can\ndo this, that, and the other thing, too!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]

So you want [VAR 0109(0000)] [VAR 0107(0002)], right?\nHow many do you want?
First, go to the Grand Underground!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Going underground is quite easy. Simply use\nyour Explorer Kit.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
It can’t be used indoors or in a cave.\c\nNow, give it a try![VAR 0114(0045)]
Aha! I see that you’ve gone underground.\nWell done! Take these as a reward!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
There are apparently some Pokémon in the\nGrand Underground that you can’t normally\r\nfind around here.\c\nMeeting a new Pokémon is 100 times more fun\nwhen it’s a rare one!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
How was it down in the Grand Underground?\nBig and empty, I would think.\c\nBut that’s just because you’re a novice spelunker!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
There are many hidden things down there that\nare invisible to the naked eye.\c\nFor my next test, I want you to dig up some\ntreasures for me.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
While underground, check the radar for any\nspots of yellow light.\c\nGo to such a location and search for treasure\nby pressing the A Button.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You’ve not located any treasure yet?\c\nListen. Check the radar and go to any yellow\nspot of light you see. Next, press the A Button\r\nto identify places to dig.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Try to get right atop the spot where a yellow\nlight is shown on your radar, OK?\c\nNow, off you go on your treasure hunt![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! I see you were able to use your radar\neffectively! Well done, indeed!\c\nHere’s your reward![VAR 0114(0045)]
Dig in the walls of the Grand Underground to\nunearth hidden things.\c\nTreasure you find will go straight into your Bag!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Spheres are special gems that can be exchanged\nfor goods down there.\c\nNow, what should I assign you next...?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Have you grown weary of repeatedly going back\nunderground? Well, it’s not over yet!\c\nNext up is your Secret Base. That’s right, I will\nteach you how to make your own Secret Base!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
All you need is the Digger Drill I gave you earlier.\c\nSimply go to the Grand Underground and use\nthe Digger Drill wherever you like.\c\nIt will instantly create your very own Secret Base!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
So, your next assignment is: make a Secret Base![VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh? You don’t know how to use the Digger Drill?\c\nOK, I’ll admit this test may have been a little\ntricky for you.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
All you must do is find the Digger Drill in your\nBag. Then, face a wall and use the Digger Drill.\r\nThat’s all it takes.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Do that and you’ll have your Secret Base before\nyou can say...\c\n<size=250%>Boo!</size>\c\nNo, but seriously, there are some walls you can’t\ndig through, like those at the corners of a tunnel.\c\nFirst, try to dig into different walls![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah, you’ve made your Secret Base. Excellent!\c\nI thought I might have been asking too much of\nyou, but you did it!\c\nWell done! Take these as your reward!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
By the by, a Digger Drill can only be used once.\c\nIf you wish to move your Secret Base, you will\nneed to obtain another Digger Drill.\c\nYou can trade spheres for one underground.\c\nNow, what should I have you do next...?[VAR 0114(0045)]
You’ve made yourself a Secret Base, yes...\nBut it’s totally empty, is it not?\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Not to worry. You can place statues in your own\nSecret Base as you see fit!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
So! For my next test, I want you to decorate your\nSecret Base. Set up statues in there as you like![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah, have I finally managed to stump you?\nPerhaps you don’t have any statues?\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Statues can be found in the stone boxes you’ll\nfind while digging for Fossils!\c\nJust check your radar for yellow lights, press the\nA Button in the right spot, and dig up treasures![VAR 0114(0045)]
Aha! You managed to decorate your Secret Base.\nI knew I recognized a top-notch spelunker in you!\c\nWell done! This is your reward!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ve taught you all that I know. But if you insist,\nthere is one more thing I should tell you.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Have you seen lights with different colors at\nthe spots where you can dig for treasure?\c\nAt these spots, you can dig into the walls more\nthan you could near the usual yellow lights...\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
It seems you can find differently-colored lights\nwhen you communicate with other spelunkers.\c\nIf you do find one, I’ll give you a rare pedestal.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh, have you found a light of a different color?\c\nIt seems you can find differently-colored lights\nwhen you communicate with other spelunkers.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
You’re a natural-born spelunker, so I’m pretty\nsure that you’ll be able to find one!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Wait, don’t tell me! You’ve found a light of a\ndifferent color?\c\nExcellent! Now you should be capable of digging\nfor more treasures than ever before.\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Well done! This is your reward!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
There really is nothing else that I can teach you.\c\nAdd more statues to your Secret Base, dig for\ntreasure, and become a master spelunker for me![VAR 0114(0045)]
So, young spelunker, are you going underground\nwith your friends?\c\nThe Grand Underground is vast. It can be a place\nwhere you meet many others like you.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh? Your Bag appears to be full.\nDiscard an item or two, then come see me again.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Hm! This belongs to you!\c[VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! You’ve stuck it out to the end! This will be\nmy final test.\c\nThe Grand Underground attracts lots of people.\nYou’re not the only one down there!\c
Other spelunkers have Secret Bases of their own.\c
Your final test is to find someone else’s Secret\nBase. When you do, make sure to look inside!\c
Ah! Have you found someone else’s Secret Base?\c
First, launch wireless communications, and then\ngo to the Grand Underground!\c\nOnce you find someone’s else’s Secret Base,\nmake sure to take a look inside!\c
Oh! The look on your face tells me you found\nsomeone else’s Secret Base!\c\nWell done. Here’s your reward!\c
Statues set up in Secret Bases appear to impart\nmysterious effects.\c\nYou can even get the power from someone else’s\nSecret Base!\c\nDon’t be shy! Make the power of statues yours!\c
The Grand Underground sure is massive!\nYou’re gonna have a blast down there!
Let’s dig up some treasure!\c\nI’m from Oreburgh. I work at the Mining Museum.\c\nI got advice from the Underground Man on\ndigging up Fossils and spheres.\c
Before I get digging, let me share his advice\nwith you—while you’re digging, you may uncover\r\ndark rocks.\c
They are very hard! If you keep hitting them, the\nwall will collapse.\c\nKeep that in mind, and you’ll be digging up\ntreasure in no time!
Oh, you’d like more advice on digging up\ntreasure and spheres?\c\nWell, your Explorer Kit contains a sledgehammer\nand a pickax. Choose either of these tools and\r\nuse them to dig into walls.\c
You get to keep the stuff you fully uncover\nbefore the wall collapses.\c
Don’t forget, the dark rocks are impossible\nto break. If you hit them too often, the wall\r\nwill collapse.\c\nKeep that in mind, and you’ll be digging up\ntreasure in no time!
New and on sale: the underground radar!\c\nThe radar indicates possible treasure locations.\nUse this handy tool to track them down!
I’m Mira. I was catching Pokémon, and then I\ngot lost. I’m so scared...\c\nPlease! Please take me to the exit!\c[VAR 0114(001E)]

Trainer, your name is [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nMy name is Mira. I like my name!\c[VAR 0114(001E)]
Oh! There’s the exit! I want to get tougher so I\nwon’t be such a scaredy-cat.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], bye-bye! Thank you!\c[VAR 0114(001E)]
Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone.[VAR 0114(001E)]
That isn’t the right way. I’ll be lost if we go down.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I like helpful Pokémon moves, like Growl\nand Minimize.\c\nThose kinds of moves are my favorites.[VAR 0114(001E)]
This cave... It’s so easy to get confused.\c\nDo you know where we are?[VAR 0114(001E)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], did you get to be so good\nbecause you’re always with your Pokémon?\c\nYes! That has to be it! I’m gonna try—like you![VAR 0114(001E)]

Also, a Pokémon you get in a trade may disobey\nyou if it is too high in level.\c\nDon’t worry, though. It will obey if you have\nenough Gym Badges.
You’ve met only [VAR 0202(0001,tagParameter=205)] Pokémon?\c\nHmm... You’ve got to find at least 35.\c\nIf you can’t, it will be tough to complete the\nSinnoh Pokédex.

Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How’s your Pokédex\ncoming along?\c\nMe? I’m somewhere between fantastic and,\nuh, hopeless...\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
But this isn’t about me! I’ve got something nice\nfor you.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], choose which hand you want.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I see... You want the Vs. Seeker.\c\nI’m impressed, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You know\nwhat’s important.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Using that Vs. Seeker, you can find Trainers who\nwant a rematch with you.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)], do you also have\na Pokétch?\c\nYup, you do. You can have this too, then.\c\nYou deserve it for all your hard\nwork, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
The [VAR 0115(0001)] is\nsomething you should touch often.\c\nIt will tell you if there is an item on the ground\nthat you can’t see.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
It will be especially useful inside dark caves.\c\nOK, let’s keep working on our Pokédexes.\nProfessor Rowan is counting on us!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How’s your Pokédex\ncoming along?\c\nMe? I’m doing great, as always... NOT!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
But that’s not important. Lately, I’ve been\nexperimenting with a couple of neat tools.\c\nI’ll share with you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nChoose a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh yeah. You want the Vs. Seeker.\c\nYup, [VAR 0100(0000)], you know\nwhat’s important.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Using that Vs. Seeker, you can find Trainers who\nwant to battle with you again.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], what about a Pokétch?\nDo you have one?\c\nYup, you do. You can have this too, then.\c\nYou deserve it for all of your\neffort, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
The [VAR 0115(0001)] is—\nwell, just try using it.\c\nIt’ll alert you if there is an unseeable item on\nthe ground.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s especially handy for finding things in\ndark caves.\c\nOK, keep working on your Pokédex.\nProfessor Rowan is counting on us!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
That slope’s too slippery. You’ll need a bike to\nget up.\c\nYou don’t have a bike? There’s a Cycle Shop in\nEterna City.
If you change gears on your bike, you can shoot\nright up that slope.

Trainer Tips\c\nPokémon may become immobilized if they are\nasleep or paralyzed.\c
If it happens to your Pokémon,\nit could be disastrous.\c\nIf your opponent’s Pokémon can’t move,\nit’s a big opportunity!
According to one theory, Mount Coronet\nis where the Sinnoh region began.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
In a newly created world—a world where only\ntime flowed and space expanded...\r\nThere should have been no strife.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
But what became of that world?\c\nBecause the human spirit is weak and\nincomplete, strife has spread...\c\nThis world is being ruined by it...\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
I find the state of things to be deplorable...\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
There appears to be a cave painting\nfrom an ancient time...
I’m hopelessly lost!\c\nPlease don’t pay attention to a lowly grunt\nwithout any Pokémon![VAR 0114(000A)]
There’s no way of getting to the peak of\nMount Coronet from this side!\c\nUh-oh... Was I supposed to go up from the\nHearthome City side?\c\nI can’t get up to the peak from the\nEterna City side?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Something huge is going to happen, I think.\nMaybe. Right...?\c\nDon’t meddle around! Of course, you’re going\nto, aren’t you? That’s why the two of us will\r\nteam up to take you down to the ground!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]

There’s no need to rush. I can understand you\nwant to battle our boss real bad, but you’ll\r\nhave to go through me first.\c\nAfter all, you’ve made me look bad more times\nthan I care to remember!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
And I’ll be next.\c\nYou might be tough, but this time, the gloves are\ncoming off!\c[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hold on one second!\c\nDon’t you start the party without me!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Humph! Well, if it isn’t the little boy who ran off\ncrying at Lake Acuity!\c\nDid you get any tougher since then? We’ll beat\nyou two-on-two!\c[VAR 0114(001C)]
You don’t think you can just run off now, do you?\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, hotshot? Now what?[VAR 0114(0012)]
What’s the matter? Don’t tell me you’re shaking?[VAR 0114(001C)]

But never mind that! It’s all destroyed!\nMy galaxy is gone! I won’t allow this.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]

Everyone seems to call me the Berry Master.\nI hand out Berries daily because I want people to\r\nlearn how wonderful they are.\c\nYou’re deserving of one!\c[VAR 0114(0046)]
Berries are gifts of nature. I encourage you to\nfeed Berries to Pokémon. That will make\r\nPokémon happy.\c\nSeeing that, people will be motivated to plant\nmore Berries, and that will make Sinnoh a\r\ngreener, more natural place.[VAR 0114(0046)]

You’re kidding! They found an Egg at the\nPokémon Nursery in Solaceon Town?
I hear they found Eggs in the Johto region, too.
I’m so glad to see you! You’re not very easy to\ntrack down. My grandma told me about what\r\ntook place in Celestic Town.\c\nThanks for what you did by the ruins!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
But that Team Galactic... I thought they were just\na bunch of eccentrics.\c\nYou know, talking about how they’re going to\nmake a new universe and all. And that weird way\r\nthey dress, too. I thought they were harmless.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It appears as if they’re a lot more trouble than I\nthought. I mean, stealing and hoarding\r\nPokémon... That’s just plain wrong.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
By the way, did you find the ruins interesting at\nall? If you did, you may want to visit the library\r\nin Canalave City.\c\nThey have some ancient books that you might\nfind interesting.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It may also be of help to the completion of your\nPokédex. I think you ought to go there.\c\nOK, bye-bye for now!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]

This is what I heard about Eggs...\c\nIf you take that Egg and travel with energetic\nPokémon, it’ll hatch.\c\nI remember someone announced that...\nProfessor Elm of Johto maybe?
Hold up. You don’t seem to have enough room\nfor the Egg.
All right, then. I’ll just keep waiting for someone\nto take care of this Egg.\c\nOh? Wait a minute. If I wait around, will the Egg\nhatch for me?

Yeah, so the Gym Leader came back, and I\nchallenged her.\c\nShe wiped the floor with us. I have to heal up\nmy team now...

When you wish to treat your Pokémon to a treat,\nwhat, I say, do you do?\c\nIf I may say so, and I will, I feed Poffins to\nmy Pokémon!\c
And why, I say, would I do that?\c\nBecause the giving of Poffins is a way of\nexpressing your love!\c
For example! If I were to give a Sweet Poffin, the\nPokémon eating it would become more cute!\c\nFor example! A Spicy Poffin will add to the\ncoolness of a Pokémon!\c
In such ways I say that Poffins have nothing but\ngoodness for Pokémon!\c\nTherefore!\c\nI declare this Poffin Case to be a gift from me,\nto you!\c
I urge you to fill it with Poffins and be generous\nin dispensing them to your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan clubs, but we are\nnumber one!\c
And why are we number one? Because I brag\nmore than anyone!\c\nBut now I can’t brag as much...\c\nPeople started complaining, so I’ve had to curtail\nmy bragging...

It’s very friendly toward you. I can tell you\ntreat it kindly.

It’s feeling neutral toward you. It’s up to you to\nchange that.
Hmm... It seems to dislike you a little.
Oh, my... I think this one really hasn’t taken too\nkindly to you.
Gua gwah?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Kukuuh.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Pip piiih![VAR 0114(0015)]
In Amity Square, you may go for a stroll with a\ncute Pokémon.
My Pikachu seems delighted to be out of its\nPoké Ball for a walk outside.\c\nI can tell because its cheeks are twitching\nlike crazy!
Pikappi![VAR 0114(000B)]
You can take a cute Pokémon out for a stroll in\nAmity Square.
I’m appalled! They refused entry to my Pokémon!\nOh, my poor Gyarados and Steelix!
Hearthome City is a great place.\c\nEvery year, it gets voted the most desirable place\nto live in Sinnoh.
If you say Hearthome City, I only say this:\nSuper Contest Shows!\c\nI’m going to enter my darling Pokémon in them!
Pippii?![VAR 0114(0015)]
There’s a wrecked stone pillar up ahead.\nI wonder what it is. It’s got me very curious.
The Super Contest Shows are interesting, but the\nruins of Solaceon Town are as well...
As a cameraman, it makes me happy to see all\nthe Pokémon involved in Super Contest Shows.
I traveled a long way to take part in these Super\nContest Shows.
I’ve given my Pokémon lots of Poffins.\c\nI’m confident that we’ll win our share of Super\nContest Shows.
Well, now, you’re a Trainer? That makes you both\npapa and mama to your Pokémon.\c
You know how having Pokémon around leads to\nnew discoveries?\c\nIt’s the same for parents and kids. I’m always\nlearning from my kids.
Kuufu fuu!
Babies and Pokémon get along\nperfectly together.\c\nWhen babies take naps, Pokémon go to sleep\nright next to them.
When I get bigger, I’m going to be a Trainer, too!
When I grow up, I want to become a\nPokémon coordinator.
My sisters get all the attention. No one even\nnotices me.
Oh, wow, you’re a Pokémon Trainer.\c\nHaving lots of Pokémon around is a lot\nof responsibility.\c\nBut that also comes with a lot of fun!
It’s the creation of a new galaxy! My new world!\c
Pikapii?[VAR 0114(000B)]
All my grandchildren are clamoring for Pokémon\nof their own.\c\nIt may be tricky to manage it, but it will brighten\nup the mood more.
Oh, no, there are no stairs in this house.\nIt’s easier that way.\c\nThe lack of stairs makes it easy for the little\nPokémon to get about.
A world in which people are compassionate\nto others...\c\nThat’s all that matters to me.
Hearthome is a kid-friendly city, they say, but\nI disagree.\c\nHearthome City is friendly to kids, grown-ups,\nand Pokémon, too.
Hiya!\c\nOh, I’ve seen you somewhere before! Where was\nit again? Hold on, it’ll come to me...\c\nOh yeah! You’re the one who was battling those\nscary looking guys in Jubilife City!\c\nI was really curious about you after that, so I\nwent ahead and did a little research.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
And then... Surprise, surprise! Turns out you’re\nconnected to the famous Professor Rowan?\r\nAnd you’ve been goin’ around defeating Gym\r\nLeaders, too? I seriously thought my eyes were\r\ngonna pop out of my head!\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
Oh, sorry! There I go running my mouth again!\nIt’s me, Bebe! You remember me, don’t you?\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
My buddy Bill developed the basic storage\nsystem. I just tinkered with it here and there\r\nto make it easier to use.\c\nAnyway, now that you’re here in Hearthome City,\nhow ’bout trying out a Super Contest Show?\c\nJust be sure to use those Stickers of yours.\nDon’t you dare forget!\c[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hiya! Been a long time!\nHow’s it going? Using the PC Boxes?\c\nOh? Now lookie here, that’s a National\nPokédex I’m seeing. Good for you!\c[VAR 0114(0027)]
You’ll be using my Boxes like crazy if you’re using\nthat now.\c\nWell, I always thought a good Trainer ought to\njuggle Boxes smartly, though\r\nI shouldn’t be the one to say so.\c[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh yeah, do you want a Pokémon\ncalled Eevee?[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, do you want the Eevee that I’ve got?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Here you go! Now, you be good to it.\c[VAR 0114(0027)]
You obtained [VAR 1305(tagParameter=1)][VAR 0101(0001)]!\c
Would you like to give a nickname to the Eevee\nthat Bebe gave you?
Here you go!\c\nWait, I can’t do that! You’ve completely filled up\nthose Pokémon Boxes I made!\c\nI know it’s sad, but you need to go let one of\nyour Pokémon go and then come back![VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, OK...\nGuess I’ll have to raise it myself.[VAR 0114(0027)]
That Eevee I gave you, I got it from a good mate\nin Johto.\c\nWho knows how many Eevee he’s raised over\nthe years.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hi! Let’s get cooking!\c\nHere’s my advice on cooking tasty Poffins for\nyour Pokémon crew!\c\nIn the beginning, while it’s still a batter, swirl it\ngently and avoid spillage.\c
When it starts to harden, churn it fast in\nbig circles!\c\nAt the end, make a wish for it to turn scrumptious\nand whirl it!
Have you got some Berries?\c\nTo make delicious Poffins, the key ingredient is a\nrare Berry.\c\nAlso, Poffins will come out yummy if you cook\nBerries as quickly as possible, but still slowly\r\nenough that you don’t spill the batter.
Eating good food makes people and Pokémon\nmore energetic and happy.\c\nIn that sense, we’re exactly alike.
Oh! My hero!\c[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, hi, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait! No! Really?! Johanna is your mom?\nSo you might be a Super Contest Show star?!\c[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, I don’t know about that.\c\nI’ve never spoken to [VAR 0100(0000)] about\nSuper Contest Shows.\c\nI’m surprised you two know each other, though.\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m a show judge, so come join us for all kinds\nof fun. If you’re unsure of yourself, we also offer\r\npractice sessions.\c[VAR 0114(0028)]
OK, Johanna, I’ll see you!\c[VAR 0114(0028)]
Were you surprised to see me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI got bored, so I came out to Hearthome for a\nlittle vacation.\c\nI’m just as surprised to see you here, my dear!\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
But are you serious about entering\nSuper Contest Shows? Not dressed that way!\c\nIt’s your Pokémon’s time to shine, so you\nshouldn’t just be dressed your usual way.\c\nPut this on for a little glamour.\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
You obtained a tuxedo!
You obtained a dress!
I’m sure it will look good on you. After all, I\nchose it.\c\nGo enjoy the Super Contest Shows, honey!\c\nShows will give you a different look at the many\ncharms of Pokémon.\c\nIt should be an eye-opening experience for you.\nBye now!\c[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re going to enter Super Contest Shows?\nBut I don’t see a Poffin Case.\c\nIt could be tough for you to win in contest shows\nwithout one.\c
But if you’re determined to enter, don’t let me\nstop you.\c\nIt wouldn’t hurt to get in some practice at the\ncounter on the right.\c
You’re going to enter Super Contest Shows?\nAnd, yup, you have a Poffin Case.\c\nLet me gift you with this fabulously\nwonderful Poffin!\c
You received a Mild Poffin!
You put away the Mild Poffin in the Poffin Case.\c
Feed that Poffin to a Pokémon you’re going to\nenter in contest shows.\c
Oh, and a word of advice. Go take a run at the\ncontest shows!\c\nHowever, the best way to get ready is to get\nsome practice first.\c\nYou can take practice sessions at the counter\non the right.\c

Like everything else, the basics are important.\nIt takes practice to win Super Contest Shows!
Oh, no. Your Poffin Case is full.
Oh, no. Your Poffin Case is full.\nI’ll give it to you another time.\c
Oh, and a word of advice. Go take a run at the\ncontest shows!\c\nHowever, the best way to get ready is to get\nsome practice first.\c\nYou can take practice sessions at the counter\non the right.\c
A Pokémon fed Poffins does better in\nVisual Evaluations.\c\nI’d better learn how to cook delicious Poffins at\nthe Poffin House!
Hello! I’m with Jubilife TV!\c\nWas this your first Super Contest Show?\nDid you have fun?\c
I may ask you to let us closely cover your story\nin the future.\c\nOh, please take this!\c
Things that people think are fun spread quickly.\c\nGood luck and take care!\nLet me interview you again sometime!
Super Contest Shows are great!\nSeriously, Super Contest Shows are great!
It’s a frame to display a photo in.
Every Super Contest Show has three parts:\nVisual! Dance! And a Contest Move!\c\nEach contestant will be graded in those\ncategories, dohoho!
If your Pokémon is selected as the Star of\nthe Show, they’ll put up its photo!
You have a great bike, so I’d like to give you\nthese great Stickers!
Giving a Rare Candy to a Pokémon will instantly\nincrease that Pokémon’s level by one.\c\nYou can raise your weak Pokémon, or you could\ntrain your strong Pokémon. Use them as you like.
At a contest show, you gotta pull off a cool\nContest Move. Then you’ll rack up a lot of hearts\r\nfrom the audience!\c\nIf you and the other contestants show your moves\noff back to back, you’ll score bonus points! Cool!
And there do I see my father. My son. My life.\c
And there do I see nature. Pokémon. The world.
The art of crafting things fatigues one’s spirit.\c\nWhen the spirit is healed, the desire to make\nsomething returns.\c\nIt is such a wondrous cycle.
When people and Pokémon join hands,\neveryone’s happy.\c\nIt makes everyone come together. It could even\nmake the world one!
That people are lonely is only natural. It gives me\ncompassion for others.\c\nIt’s what makes me look forward to a\nbetter tomorrow.\c
But there are still moments of fondness for the\npast. Time can heal some sadness, though...
There are still words that not everyone can\ndescribe... The words are “love” and “joy.”
Pokémon... People... It’s only natural that we are\nall so very different.\c\nMake sure that you never judge a Pokémon\nbased on whether it’s weak or strong.\c\nYou must always look for the good inside of\nthem. That’s what counts!

Try fishing wherever there is a body of water.\c\nOh, incidentally, do you need me to explain how\nto use that fishing rod?
You don’t like to fish?
First, you face a body of water. Then, you use\nyour fishing rod.\c\nNext, you must focus. If a Pokémon bites,\nan “!” appears. That’s your cue to reel it in!
When you’re fishing for Pokémon, the first hurdle\nis getting a bite.\c\nAfter you reel the Pokémon in, you’ve got to\nbattle it. So, fishing gives you double the fun!
Do you jog every morning, too?
When I was jogging the other day, a wild\nPokémon came after me.\c\nI ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear.

This is for your trouble. It’s not much, but thanks!\c
You really came through for us! I hope you’ll help\nus again tomorrow!
Whoops! What’s all this? Your Bag is stuffed full.\nI’ll hold on to these until next time.
Oh, there you are! Here’s your reward for the last\nassignment! It’s not much, but thanks!
What’s wrong? You still haven’t caught the\n[VAR 0101(0000)] we need?\c\nWe’re counting on you to come through for us!\c\nBring us the [VAR 0101(0000)] before the date\nrolls over!
Now, now! You failed to bring me the Pokémon I\nasked for...\c\nThings like that can happen, but we need you to\ncome up big for us!
OK! I’ll crank out a riveting story based on this!\c\nOh, right! I’ll have another assignment for\nyou tomorrow!
The Sinnoh region’s newspaper is tiny, but it has\nmany fans. That newspaper is printed right here!
“Weekly Poké Ball Roundup” is the top story.\nIt’s a feature article on new types of Poké Balls.\c
Which article would you like to read?
Dark caves and streets unlit at night are\nforbidding places to go.\c\nIf you’re threatened by the dark, a supply of\nDusk Balls is your biggest ally!\c
Use them in the dark for the best Pokémon-\ncatching performance!\c\nKeep the dark at bay on your travels with\nDusk Balls!
Catching Pokémon is best accomplished by\nwhittling the target’s HP down as low as possible,\r\nthen throwing a Poké Ball.\c
But a Pokémon caught like that probably\nshouldn’t be used in battle right away.\c\nThat’s where the Heal Ball comes in handy.\c
It doesn’t matter if you lower the target’s HP bar\nto red, put the target to sleep, or paralyze it—\r\nthe Heal Ball will instantly heal whatever ails the\r\nPokémon it catches!\c\nThat’s the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball! Please,\ndo give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon, you want\nto cut the target’s HP.\c\nBut a fleet-footed Pokémon could bolt if you\ntake too much time.\c
The Quick Ball is the solution to that dilemma.\c
It’s designed to work best when thrown right at\nthe start of battle! The Quick Ball: the perfect\r\ngift for the impatient Trainer!
Every so often, Eggs will be found at the\nPokémon Nursery.\c\nAnd they’re found without anyone knowing how\nthey got there. Is someone leaving them there?
They say no one has ever seen a Pokémon\nactually lay an Egg.\c\nSo, it hasn’t been proven that Pokémon actually\nlay Eggs.
I’m researching Unown!\c\nUnown has a lot of different forms.\nFascinating, isn’t it?\c\nI’d love for you to show me Unown, if you’ve\ngot any.
Wow! I’ve never seen that form of\n[VAR 0101(0000)] before!\c\nPlease take this Ball Capsule as my thanks.\c
Wow! I’ve never seen [VAR 0101(0000)]\nin that form!\c\nThank you! If you happen to find a different\nform, please show it to me.
Oh, you’ve already shown me [VAR 0101(0000)]\nin that form.\c\nIf you find a different form, please show it to me.
Wow! That’s the last form of [VAR 0101(0000)]\nthat I hadn’t seen.\c\nIt must’ve taken a lot of work to find all those.\nThank you so much!\c\nThis last Ball Capsule is yours now.\c
The world of Unown is very deep. I wonder why...
My son just loves those nearby ruins.
If you don’t mind, can you show him the\nPokémon you catch in the ruins?
?!

The Psyduck are standing firm. They aren’t\ninclined to move at all.\c\nWould you like to use the Secret Medicine?
You used the Secret Medicine!\c\nThe Psyduck appear to be cured of their\nchronic headaches!\c
Oh good. You used the Secret Medicine\nI gave you.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Psyduck are known to suffer from\nchronic headaches.\c\nBut no one’s been able to figure out what\ntriggers the headaches.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, yes! Can I ask you a big favor?\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
I want you to deliver this Old Charm to my\ngrandma in Celestic Town.\c\nI know there are some rare Pokémon between\nhere and Celestic Town, so it will be worth your\r\nwhile to go.[VAR 0114(001A)]
My grandma has this sort of bossy air about her.\nI think you’ll recognize her right away.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Yes, I’m sure you will. She’s the elder of\nCelestic Town.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
As for the location... Look on your Town Map.\nYou can’t miss it.\c\nOK, I’m counting on you! See you again down\nthe road!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
I know I’m asking a big favor of you.\c\nBut I really want you to do it. Will you go to\nCelestic Town for me?[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’m taking a rest. If I were a bird Pokémon, it\nwould be a roost. Haha!\c\nUh... You should rest up, too.\c
If they had to keep flying forever, bird Pokémon\nwould eventually crash.
I’m going to keep running. Just as long as there’s\na road...

Howdy, traveler!\c\nSome of our customers are rowdy types that want\nto battle. But pay it no mind and stay awhile.
How are ya doing? Whatcha having? Course, all\nwe ever have is Moomoo Milk.\c\nMoomoo Milk, 500. Want a bottle?
Here’s your Moomoo Milk. Enjoy.\c
Oh! Your Bag’s full, sweetie.
Oh! You don’t have the money, sweetie.
All right, then.\c\nI should tell you, it’s not that we can only get\nMoomoo Milk. No. We choose to serve only\r\nMoomoo Milk. We’re very particular about it.
Youngster, you’ve seen the Psyduck huddled\noutside? Psyduck are Pokémon that suffer from\r\nchronic headaches...\c\nI’m afraid we’ll have to wait for them to\nget better.
Well, well! So I hear you’ve relieved the Psyduck\nof their headaches.\c\nThe person who gave you the Secret Medicine\nmust be quite the Trainer!
If I could use the hidden move Defog, I’d clear\nup the weather in two flaps of a Staravia’s wings.\c\nHow does Defog work, you ask? Bird Pokémon\nflap their wings to blow the fog away.

Grandma Wilma’s House
Hohoho... They call me Grandma Wilma.\c\nI came out here by myself from a town of\nDragon Tamers.\c[VAR 0114(002C)]
I can teach the strongest of all Dragon-type\nmoves to the tough Pokémon of Sinnoh.\c[VAR 0114(002C)]
Would you like me to teach that move to one of\nyour Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Ah, it is you again...\c\nWould you like me to teach the best Dragon-\ntype move I know to one of your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Well, perhaps if you change your mind, do\ncome back.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I see... I like your sense of adventure.\c\nHowever, none of your Pokémon can learn\nthe move.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Fine, fine. Now pick the Pokémon I should teach\nthe move to.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Sorry to disappoint you...\c\nYou have a Pokémon that can learn this\nmove, but it hasn’t come to trust you fully yet.\c[VAR 0114(002C)]
Until then, I can’t make it learn this move.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Sorry to disappoint you... That Pokémon can’t\nlearn this move.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hmmmm...\c\nTeaching a move to an Egg is a challenge that’s\nbeyond me.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh? That Pokémon already knows\n[VAR 0107(0000)].[VAR 0114(002C)]
Draco Meteor’s destructive power is\nawe-inspiring.\c\nHowever, using this move will also lower your\nPokémon’s Sp. Atk.[VAR 0114(002C)]

Team Galactic conducts research around the\nclock here. We focus on the development of new\r\nenergy resources.

So, it’s you...\c\nI’ve heard about you and what took place at the\nSpear Pillar.\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
What our boss really wanted... Even I don’t\nknow that.\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
His confident manner of speaking...\nHis logical words...\c\nI think people just became so enthralled by him.\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
I allowed myself to believe his words because I\nwanted to see the world he intended to make.\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ve been left in charge of headquarters and the\nremnants of the membership.\c\nThe decision of what Team Galactic should do\nrests with me.\c\nBut I’ve learned that extremism is never\nthe solution...[VAR 0114(002D)]

I see. You must be the Trainer I’ve been\nhearing about.\c\nThe foolhardy one that’s trying to stand up to\nTeam Galactic.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
Although I’d hardly expected to see that the\nTrainer is a mere child.\c\nI’d heard that our commanders had a rough time\nwith you.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
I know why you’re here. I can sense it in you.\c\nIt’s about Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, correct?\nYou want to save them.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
I no longer have any need for them. I am finished\nwith them.\c\nIf your heart aches to save them, go right ahead.\nI could care less.\c\nIt will save me the trouble of disposing of them.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
But I must say...you are a remarkable specimen.\c\nThose Pokémon have nothing to do with you, do\nthey not?\c\nBut still you came to rescue them out of pity?\c\nSuch pitifully useless emotions... It’s illogical\nand irrational.\c\nPity and compassion are products of the weak\nand lacking human heart.\c\nYou were compelled to come here by such\nvacuous sentimentality!\c\nI will make you regret paying heed to your heart!\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
I see. You are indeed strong.\c\nAnd the basis of your power is your compassion\ntoward Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
How wasteful... Such emotions are but\nmere illusions.\c\nAnd, like all illusions, they fade over time until\ndeath banishes them forever.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
That is why I have abandoned all emotions as\nuseless sentimentality.\c\nBut that doesn’t matter. I doubt you will ever\nunderstand my position.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]
That said, I recognize that you are strong and\ncourageous to come alone. This is your reward.\c[VAR 0114(001F)]

Team Galactic Report\c
Which report would you like to read?
Some say the universe originated from a\nmassive explosion.\c\nSimilarly, Sinnoh is thought to have been formed\nby an explosion in ancient times.\c
Needless to say, the explosion came from the\npower of a Pokémon.\c\nThe Pokémon must have been the mythical\ncreature considered a deity by the ancients.\c
Our aim is not to capture the mythical Pokémon\nbut to obtain its power...\c\nThe PC entry ends there.\c
The mythical Pokémon...\c\nAccording to myths, the Pokémon created Sinnoh\nwith its power.\c
However, capturing the Pokémon with a\nPoké Ball prevents it from using its full power.\c
But with the Red Chain, the Pokémon can be\nshackled, and its power can be used\r\nwithout restraint...\c
The PC entry ends there.\c
The Red Chain...\c\nThe Pokémon of the three lakes and\nMount Coronet are somehow connected.\c
Capturing the Pokémon of the lakes will free the\nPokémon of Mount Coronet.\c
From the Pokémon of the lakes, crystals can be\nextracted to create a Red Chain.\c\nUsing that Red Chain, the mythical Pokémon can\nbe summoned and shackled to do as\r\nwe command.\c
The PC entry ends there.\c
I’m a Team Galactic member—but I don’t even\nhave a Pokémon!\c\nI’m the gruntiest of the grunts!\c\nIt’s my fault, though. I still don’t know how the\nwarp panels connect.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I derive so much pleasure from record mixing\nwith others...\c\nIt shows me that I’m not alone. It heartens me\na great deal.
Welcome to the Great Marsh, the home of\nPastoria’s Safari Game!\c\nAll you can catch for just 500!\nWould you like to play a Safari Game?
That will be 500, please.\c
Here are your Safari Balls.\c
You received 30 Safari Balls.\c
We’ll let you know when your game is over.\c\nUntil then, enjoy yourself, please! Off you go on\nyour wild excursion!\c
You don’t have enough money. Sorry.\c
I’m sorry, but you don’t have enough room to\ncatch any more Pokémon.\c\nPlease manage the Pokémon in your party or in\nPokémon Boxes to make room, then try again!
You still have time left. Are you sure you want to\nexit the Great Marsh?
OK. I’ll relieve you of your remaining Safari Balls.\nThank you for playing.\c\nWe hope to see you again.\c
Welcome to the Great Marsh! Is this your first\nSafari Game?
When you enter the Great Marsh, you receive\n30 Safari Balls. That’s the only kind of ball you’re\r\nallowed to use in the Safari Game.\c
The game is over when you run out of Safari\nBalls or when you’ve walked 500 steps.\c\nPlease do enjoy the untamed nature of the\nGreat Marsh!
I see. Enjoy your Safari Game!
It’s a pair of binoculars. Put 100 in it?
You don’t have enough money...
Tell me I’m not imagining this...\c\nThe Great Marsh’s Pokémon seem to be different\nfrom the ones yesterday.
Use a pair of binoculars to look out over the\nGreat Marsh. You can see what kinds of Pokémon\r\ncan be caught and where they are.
There are shuttle trains in the marsh called\nQuick Trams. You should take those if you’re\r\ngoing to a deeper area in the marsh.
When you’re walking on the bog, you sometimes\nsink right in... I get so flustered trying to get out,\r\nI have no luck catching anything.
I’ve been hiking all around the Sinnoh region.\nI love planting Berries wherever I go.\c\nI’ll give you a Berry, too. Please plant\nit somewhere.\c
Planting Berries is good for Pokémon. It provides\nthem with more things to eat in the wild.
My sister gathers Berries every day! Please come\nvisit again!\c\nWe cook the Berries, too! We mix them up!\nThey’re yummy!
Hmmm... Burmy are an interesting example.\c\nThey hint at how the environment can shape\npeople’s personalities.
You know about Burmy and how they come in\ndifferent forms?\c\nDo you have all forms of that there Burmy?\c
Aww, you don’t even have a single Burmy? You\ndon’t like ’em? They’re kind of mooshy and cute!
Hmm... It’d be cool if you had all the\ndifferent-looking Burmy.
Cool! That’s all the different kinds of Burmy!\nI feel giddy!\c\nSince I feel so giddy, take this! Go ahead, take it!\c
Whoops, your Bag is crammed full! I’ll give this\nto you later.
You’re good! You’d make an awesome\nBug Maniac!
Everyone calls me the Pokémon Move Maniac.\nI prefer Move Tutor.\c\nI know every move that Pokémon learn while\nthey’re leveling up, and I can teach Pokémon\r\nthose moves.\c
I can teach a move to a Pokémon of yours if\nyou’d like. I’ll do it if you’ll trade me a\r\nHeart Scale.\c
Oh! That’s it! That’s an honest-to-goodness\nHeart Scale! Let me guess—you want me to teach\r\none of your Pokémon a move?\c
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a move,\ncome back with a Heart Scale.
Which Pokémon needs tutoring?\c
Which move should I teach?\c
Sorry... There isn’t any move I can teach\nthat Pokémon.
Huh? Don’t you think it’d be tough for an Egg\nto learn a move?
You handed over [VAR 1305(tagParameter=4)][VAR 0109(0004)] in exchange.
Thank you very much for giving me so many\nHeart Scales!\c\nTo show my gratitude, I’ll start teaching moves to\nyour Pokémon for free—no Heart Scales required!
Do you want me to teach your Pokémon a move?
Come back when you want me to teach a move\nto your Pokémon.
In the Great Marsh, they use Quick Trams on rails\nfor transportation. They prevent damage to the\r\nGreat Marsh’s ecosystem.
Gwah?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Howdy, there! Let me examine your Pokémon to\nsee if it’s worthy of a scarf!\c
Hmhm... I see...\c
This isn’t what I had hoped to see... I can’t lie\nto you, so I’ll just have to tell it to you straight.\c\nThis Pokémon’s not bad, but it’s not good, either.\nIt’s just so-so.\c
If you want to improve this one’s conditions,\nfeed it some more Poffins!
Your Pokémon is growing up really good.\nMy hat’s off to you.\c\nI was going to give you a scarf, but your\nBag’s full.
Your [VAR 0101(0000)]’s looking good!\nI’d say it’s pretty impressive!\c\nTell you what, I’ll give you\nthis [VAR 0109(0001)]!\c
The Red Scarf stands for passion!\c\nLet a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in\nCoolness Contests.
The Blue Scarf represents the vastness of the sea!\c\nLet a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in\nBeauty Contests.
The Pink Scarf represents charm!\c\nLet a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in\nCuteness Contests.
The Green Scarf represents the spring breeze!\c\nLet a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in\nCleverness Contests.
The Yellow Scarf stands for determination!\c\nLet a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in\nToughness Contests.
I’m out of scarves to give you!\nI’m out of things to say, too!
My brother’s girlfriend is the Massage Girl in\nVeilstone City.\c\nThey take strolls with their Pokémon whenever\nthey get together. It really helps them stay close!

Where would you like to go?
You didn’t board the Quick Tram.
Would you like to exit the Great Marsh\nright now?
Go upstairs to the Observatory before you start\nyour Safari Game.\c\nCheck the marsh with the binoculars to see\nwhere the Pokémon you want happen to be.\c\nThat’s how you win!

Throwing food at Pokémon makes it easier to\ncatch them, but while eating it, they are\r\nlikely to bolt.\c
Throwing mud at a Pokémon makes it harder to\ncatch, but it’ll also get angry and become less\r\nlikely to bolt.\c\nUrgh, what to do...?

I found these during the Safari Game.\c\nEach of these TMs contains Defog, but none of\nof my Pokémon can learn that move.\c\nYou’d be doing me a favor if you took these.\c

If a Pokémon were to travel alone, it would be\nlimited as to where it could go.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
But traveling with a human, a Pokémon would be\nable to travel farther afield to more distant cities\r\nand lands.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Traveling with [VAR 0100(0001)] has been\nrewarding and reassuring. And very entertaining...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others for\ntraveling with humans.\c\nThey jeer that the caught Pokémon have\n“forgotten the wild.”\c[VAR 0114(0032)]

Does [VAR 0100(0001)] intend to ignore me\nforever? Give me more opportunities to shine...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend, it will return\nthe sentiment.\c\nWe grow fonder of humans that treat us with\nkindness... Does [VAR 0100(0001)] even like me?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Did I get stronger? Who is responsible for\nmaking me so?\c\nIs it [VAR 0100(0001)]’s doing? Is the Trainer\nowed my thanks?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
[VAR 0100(0001)] and I are alike in some ways.\c\nIn human-speak, we match up well. Does [VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=he|she)]\nthink so, too?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
[VAR 0100(0001)] is very impressive, especially\nfor a human.\c\nThis Trainer lets me use every bit of power\nproperly. It is a shame that [VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=he|she)] is only a human...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
That [VAR 0100(0001)]... What is [VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=he|she)] thinking?\c\nWhy make me join the team, then call upon me\nfor nothing?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Am I considered useless? Is the Trainer regretting\nhaving me?\c\nDoes the Trainer dare disrespect this\n[VAR 0101(0000)] so easily?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
I have little understanding of [VAR 0100(0001)]\nas a human...\c\n[VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=He|She)] may not be too bad, considering that I, an\noft-shunned [VAR 0101(0000)], am one of\r\nthe team...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
That said, I don’t intend to be all cheerful\naround [VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=him|her)].\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark and dank places.\c\nBut being with [VAR 0100(0001)], even bright and\nfestive places seem less threatening...\c\n[VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=He|She)] has a strange charisma...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Not for a moment did I think I would be traveling\nwith a human.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
If my [VAR 0101(0000)] friends were to see me\nnow, they would be shocked!\c\nOr would they be envious of me?\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
That [VAR 0100(0001)] is the most impressive\nof humans—\c\nIt takes a lot to make me, [VAR 0102(0002)],\nsunny and cheerful!\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
As a show of affection, I should chomp down on\n[VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=his|her)] neck!\c\nHahaha! Have no fear, I was merely joking...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Wooooooh... I have nothing to do...\c\nKeep me too bored, and I’m liable to sneak up\nand bite.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Is there any human that would grow to like\nus [VAR 0101(0000)]?\c\nWell? Does [VAR 0100(0001)] like me?\nI like [VAR 1300(tagParameter=255,tagWordArray=him|her)]... Or, wait, maybe I don’t.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
[VAR 0100(0001)] treats me, [VAR 0102(0002)],\nnicely without being scared. But I will be even\r\nscarier from now on.\c\nThat’s just what we [VAR 0101(0000)] do...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
I’m starting to forget a little about being in\nthe wild...\c\nBut I’m not feeling sad. It’s never boring when\nI’m together with [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
There are no Pokémon that dislike humans, only\nhumans that dislike Pokémon...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
We [VAR 0101(0000)] are especially shunned...\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0001)] always treats me as a\nfriend and partner...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrrr... Hunh? This is...where?\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]’s house, is this?\nIt’s not? Hnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
If you don’t need me for anything, can I go back\nto my Poké Ball?\c\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nI like to sleep most the time.\r\nOh, I like to eat, too. That’s next.\c\nBut what I really like is to think. I’m a very\ndeep thinker.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
When I think about the future of the\n[VAR 0101(0000)] species...\c\nHnurrr...hunh?\c\nOh, I forget where the time goes.\nHnurrrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nThere are lots of kinds of moves.\c\nI like those Dark-type moves.\nOh, and Dragon-type moves, too...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
How would they be for this [VAR 0101(0000)]?\c\nWill they be for me? Or a no-no sort of thing?\c\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... I don’t know how to begin saying this...\c\nBefore I met [VAR 0100(0001)], I liked living\nquietly. Sssh.\c\nBut I’m getting to like traveling\nwith [VAR 0100(0001)].\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
I think I’m getting sort of funky.\nDo you think I’m sort of funky?\c\nNo? No funk for me?\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nOther Pokémon, they say to me...\c\n“You’re not thinking, are you?”\c\nHow insulting they should say so. It isn’t true\nwhat they say. Think, think, think, I do that.\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
All the time, I think hard how to help\n[VAR 0100(0001)]. I concentrate!\c\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr...\nI did not know that?\r\nI really don’t? What is this?\r\nI don’t know what to say?\r\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... Well, I...I think I’m motivated.\c\nAs motivated as the average.\nBut it’s not so simple as that.\r\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... How should I say this?\c\nWe both look out for each other.\nThat’s what we try to do, I think.\r\nThat is for the best.\r\nHnurrrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr... How do I say? How should I describe us?\c\nWe are the sound of both hands clapping.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)] and I are together in\nsynchronicity like twins.\c\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Hnurrr...\nWhat is left to say, I say?\c\nWe have come so far now, where can we go but\nto see this through?\c\nHall of Fame...\nWords so sweet fall from my mouth.\c\nHnurrr...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Sssshhnnn...\nSsshhhnnn...\r\nSsshhhnnn...\c[VAR 0114(0032)]
Oh, hello. You wish to stay the night?\c\nI’m afraid we are totally booked. You may rest a\nwhile, if you wish.\c
We’ve restored your Pokémon to full health.\c\nWe hope to see you again!
This hotel is so romantic...\c\nI hope a knight on a Pokémon will sweep me\naway for a honeymoon here!
Is that right? You’re a traveler?\c\nYes, it’s good to see other places!\c
Do you know about Mount Moon in the\nKanto region?\c\nClefairy dancing under the moon... It’s something\nI must see in my lifetime.
Have you heard of the Tin Tower in the\nJohto region?\c\nThe rainbow-colored Pokémon... I must see that\nin my lifetime.
Do you know about the Space Center in the\nHoenn region?\c\nA rocket launching into space... I must see that\nin my lifetime.
Have you heard of the Whirl Islands in the\nJohto region?\c\nThe silver-colored Pokémon... I must see that\nin my lifetime.
We’re a traveling troupe of street performers.\c\nIn place of a formal introduction, please,\ntake these!\c
Trick Room is a doozy of a weird move—\nuse it, and for a while afterward, the slowest\r\nPokémon get to use their attack first! Bam!\c\nHow you use Trick Room is up to you, Trainer.
Let me gaze into your eyes...\nI will read your fortune...\c\n...\c
A magical encounter is in the winds...\c\nThough I cannot tell whether it will be with a\nPokémon or a Trainer...
A brief occasion of joy is imminent...\c\nBut remember this: the good and the bad are on\nopposite sides of a coin...
Destiny shall shift...\c\nWhether that bodes well or ill is beyond the\nscope of my sight...
Many are the eyes that I have gazed into over\nthe years, be they human or Pokémon...\c
But your eyes swirl with compassion, strength,\njoy, sorrow, and more...\c\nThe ever-shifting colors in your eyes make you\ndifficult to read.
Me, I’m just a simple soul. I let my guitar do all\nmy talking. All I need is music and Pokémon.\c\nI can shine wherever I go if I have those things\nin my life.
The reservations were full up, but they managed\nto get us in here.\c\nWe’re finally alone, the two of us—if you’d leave,\nthat is.\c
This is something we don’t need anymore.\nWill you take it?\c
I’ve always relied on the old Coin Toss app to\nmake any decision.
That Coin Toss app is why we ended up in this\nmusty, old, and stinky suite...
We wanted to be together alone so we could\ntalk without being disturbed.\c\nWe really need this time together...\nJust the two of us...
What do you want?\c\nAre you one of those nitwits we fooled into\nguarding the entrance?\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
Bah, it doesn’t matter who you are. It’s too late\nto make a difference. Things are going to get\r\nreally interesting now.\c\nAll the legendary Pokémon are going to be\nbrought to our HQ in Veilstone City.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Even Team Galactic has no use for Magikarp!\nWorthless, all of them![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hahaha!\nNext stop, Lake Verity!\c\nThe closest thing to civilization out there is that\nhick town, Twinleaf! We can roll in there\r\ncompletely unopposed![VAR 0114(000A)]
A Magikarp is weakly flopping about...

The mission is proceeding without a hitch.\nThe boss should be pleased.\c\nEverything is for everyone, and for the good of\nTeam Galactic!\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
I recognize your face!\c\nYou’re the child who raided the Team Galactic\nbuilding in Eterna City!\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
Humph! Jupiter should be ashamed of herself,\nbeing beaten by a child like that.\c\nBut anything and anyone that opposes Team\nGalactic must be crushed! Even the very thought\r\nof opposition will not be tolerated!\c[VAR 0114(005A)]
Gah! Even I, a commander, only managed to buy\nus time?\c\nBut that’s fine. A child like you will never be able\nto stem the flow of time!\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
Team Galactic will get the three legendary\nPokémon of the lakes!\c\nWith their power, we will create an entirely\nnew universe!\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
By now, Mars should have captured the Pokémon\nof Lake Verity...\c[VAR 0114(002D)]
Kyuuun...\c
Azelf disappeared deep into the cavern...
There’s an odd spaceman in front of the ruins.\c\nThere isn’t anything there, but that only seemed\nto make him angry. He’s saying he will blow\r\nthe town up with a bomb...\c
The nerve of it all!\c\nIf only I were younger, I’d punish that spaceman\nwith my Pokémon...
This town is insignificant!\c\nThere’s nothing of value here. It doesn’t need to\nexist, so I’ll blow it up with a Galactic Bomb!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you try to mess with me, I’ll shut you down with\na Pokémon battle.\c\nSo, what’s it going to be?\nAre you going to mess with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You dare to oppose Team Galactic?\nThat means you’re taking on the world—\c\nNo, the universe, even!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s right! Very smart! You know what’s good\nfor you! Team Galactic has come out to the\r\nboonies like this for everyone’s sake.\c\nYour cooperation is appreciated.\c\nNow, where is my partner?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Too much...to handle...\c\nWhatever! I’m out of this one-horse town!\nThere’s nothing to do here anyways!\c[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well aren’t you quite the Trainer!\nThat was magnificent!\c\nAs the elder of Celestic Town,\nI give you my thanks.\c
Oh? That Old Charm... May I see that, dear?\c\nWhat’s that? You say Cynthia entrusted you with\nit to deliver to me?\c\nThat Cynthia... She’s my granddaughter.\c
You handed over the [VAR 0109(0001)]\nto the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in\nCelestic Town long, long ago.\c\nIt was made in honor of a mythical deity said to\nhave created Sinnoh. These Old Charms are still\r\ndiscovered now and again.\c
Since you’re in Celestic Town, why not look\naround inside the ruins?
You’ve gone to the trouble of visiting Celestic\nTown, so why not take a little more time to\r\nexamine the ruins?
There appears to have been an insignificant\nstruggle here. Everyone should step back and\r\nview things from a bigger perspective.\c\nYes, a bigger perspective—one that is on a\nuniversal scale.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
My name is Cyrus.\c\nI seek the power to create a new world—a world\nwithout strife.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
However...\nThat power seems to be unavailable here.\c\nWe’ve met before, yes? It was at Mount Coronet.\nIf you discover any power derived from the\r\nlegends of Sinnoh, inform me.\c[VAR 0114(0048)]
For that power is what I need to create my\nnew world.\c[VAR 0114(0048)]
Howdy!\nStudying up on local history?
Hey, do you know what they say?\c\nThey say a Pokémon created the Sinnoh region.
There’s no Poké Mart in this town...\c\nInstead, you can buy and sell items in the house\nright next to me.
Celestic Town\nThe Past Lives
A giant etching of a Pokémon-like creature\ncovers the wall...\c\nThere is some fading text etched in as well...\c\n“The flow of time never stops...\nThe past, future, and present...”
A giant etching of a Pokémon-like creature\ncovers the wall...\c\nThere is some fading text etched in as well...\c\n“Space is ever-expanding dimensions...\nOur spirits, too, are as space...”
What would bring you to a place so far off the\nbeaten path? There is nothing to see here but\r\nsome ancient Pokémon etchings...
They say this town has been here since Sinnoh\nwas made.
Oh, now, this is interesting.\nLet’s see your Pokémon.\c
It clearly likes you very much. You can have this!\c
It’s about trust between the Trainer and\nthe Pokémon.\c\nDeveloping trust in each other is the key\nto victory.
It’s warming up to you in a very nice way.\c\nIt will grow even more friendly if you travel with\nit some more.
It’s not very used to you yet.\c\nYou both need to develop trust for one another\nas Trainer and Pokémon.
Where are you from?\c
Hmmm, Twinleaf Town, you say? Isn’t that close\nto Lake Verity?\c\nThat lake is said to be home to Mesprit, the\nbeing of emotion. It must be looking over you.
Hm? If you get the Gym Badge from Hearthome,\nyou can use the hidden move Surf anytime.\c\nUsing the hidden move Surf, you’ll be able to go\nto places that were once out of reach.
Celestic Town is the oldest town in all of Sinnoh.\c\nThe town was founded to honor Pokémon from\nthe distant past—or at least that’s the legend...
Well, hello!\nYou look well.\c\nI did some research of my own since that spot of\ntrouble last time.\c
Mount Coronet acting up had me very\nconcerned, too.\c
Well, this is what I found in the shrine—a book!\c\nIt’s quite old. See for yourself.\c
It reads... “Palkia, the Pokémon that binds the\nspatial dimensions.”\c
It reads... “Dialga, the guardian Pokémon\nof time.”\c
It seems that there were two Pokémon in ancient\nSinnoh. They respectively stood as symbols\r\nof time and spatial dimensions...
My big sister is studying the myths of Sinnoh.\c
She wants to know how people and Pokémon\ninteracted in the days of myths.\c
Were things different back then?\nOr were they the same as now?\c\nShe says that’s the focus of her research.
It’s hard to tell for sure, but it’s probably an\ninvaluable scroll.
It’s an old book. You began reading it.\c\n“When that Pokémon was born, intelligence\nbloomed among us, enriching our lives.\c
“When that Pokémon was born, emotions\nbloomed among us, giving us joy and sorrow.\c
“When that Pokémon was born, willpower\nbloomed among us, spurring us into action.”
Oh, hello!\nIt’s been a while since our last customer!
Putting on a pair of glasses changes how the\nworld looks.\c\nTaking off a pair of glasses changes how the\nworld looks, too. Deep, man.\c
So, would you like to change how the world\nlooks to your Pokémon?\c
Morning is the start of a new day.\c\nPut on Choice Specs and make the\nright choices.\c
The sunlight is bright in the daytime. How about\na pair of Black Glasses?\c
At night, reflect on what you’ve learned with\nWise Glasses.\c
Choice Specs make the Pokémon use only one\nkind of move. But they also raise the Pokémon’s\r\nSp. Atk stat.
Black Glasses raise the power of\nDark-type moves.
Wise Glasses boost the power of special moves.
Mount Coronet towers at the center of Sinnoh.\nIn a way, it’s the closest place to the sky in\r\nthis region.
If I climb to the top of Mount Coronet, will I be\nable to see all of Sinnoh?
I must bear down and train—and for that, time\nis unimportant.\c\nTherefore, I have no need for a watch. Take this\nfrom me!\c
Analog Watch or Digital Watch, use whichever\nyou prefer.\c\nThe same is true for Pokémon—there are many,\nbut you should befriend whichever you like.
Pinny haaa![VAR 0114(0033)]
You examined the ancient cave painting.\c\nMysterious designs cover a whole section of\nthe wall.\c
There are three strange things forming a triangle.\nIn the middle of them is a shining sphere...\c\nWhat is this all about?\c
The cave painting reminds me of an old story...\c\nThere existed a being—a being so powerful,\nit was considered a deity at the time.\c
Opposing this being were three Pokémon.\c\nThe three kept balance with the one, as if they\nformed a triangle.\c
It’s an ancient legend of Sinnoh that is still told\nto this day in Celestic Town.\c
Oh, yes. I found something useful. You should\ntake these.\c\nThey belonged to my granddaughter, but she’s\nnot using them.\c
Each of those TMs contains Surf.\c\nThe user controls a huge wave, drags everything\naround it except for the user itself, and attacks.\c
And my granddaughter said something about...\nWhat was it?\c
Oh, yes! You can use Surf from your Pokétch to\ncross water, such as seas and rivers.\c\nTo use that hidden move in the field, however,\nyou must first obtain the Hearthome Gym Badge.\c\nOn that matter, you will have to handle it\nyourself, I’m afraid.\c

Yeah, yeah... You’re just a bit better than me,\nas usual. But listen up!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Let me tell you who’s going to take on the\nPokémon League and become the Champion.\c\nYou guessed right—it’s going to be me!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Anyways, you should be able to take on the Gym\nLeader here. Now hurry up and get to it!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey, that’s the Mine Badge! Good going!\c\nYou’re even tough enough to take a shot at\nbecoming the Pokémon Champion.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Of course, I’m tougher, so that’s not actually\ngoing to happen.\c\nAnyways, [VAR 0100(0001)], come with me to\nthe library.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Whoa!\nThat tremor... That wasn’t a natural occurrence.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]

You’ll be OK, won’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
What happened at Lake Valor? I wonder...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’re going off to Lake Verity first. If there turns\nout to be trouble, don’t do anything rash.[VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re going to investigate Lake Verity before we\njoin you. Don’t be a hero if things go south.[VAR 0114(0005)]

What’s up? Your clothes look damp. Were you\nswimming at the beach right by Sandgem Town?
That tremor sure didn’t feel like an earthquake...\nIt felt more like an explosion.
Welcome to Canalave, the canal city!\c\nIn the old days, this port used to be a hub\nfor cargo transportation.
What was that tremor? For a moment I thought\nMount Coronet had erupted!
I’m going to study at the library. Aren’t books\njust lovely?\c\nI love how reading takes me to places far away\nin time and space.
An explosion at Lake Valor? But there isn’t\nanything there, is there?
My Psyduck is very smart. It can use the move\nFuture Sight!
N-not even m-my Psyduck’s Future Sight could\nforetell that tremor!

“Sinnoh Region’s Mythology”\c\nLong ago, when Sinnoh had just been made,\nPokémon and humans led separate lives.\c\nThat is not to say they did not help each other.\nNo, indeed they did.\c\nThey supplied each other with goods, and\nsupported each other.\c
A Pokémon proposed to the others to always be\nready to help humans.\c\nIt asked that Pokémon be ready to appear\nbefore humans—always.\c
Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to us if we\nventure into tall grass.

Into the lakes they dove.\nDeep, deep, drawing no breath.\c\nDeeper, deeper they dove.\nInto suffocating depths they dove.\c\nDeeper, then deepest they alight.\nFrom the lake floor they rise.\c
Bearing with them the power to make vast lands,\nthey rise again.

“Veilstone’s Myth”\c\nA young man, callow and foolish in innocence,\ncame to own a sword.\c\nWith it, he smote Pokémon, which gave\nsustenance, with carefree abandon.\c
Those not taken as food, he discarded, with\nno afterthought.\c\nThe following year, no Pokémon appeared.\nLarders grew bare.\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
The young man, seeking the missing Pokémon,\njourneyed afar.\c\nLong did he search. And far and wide, too, until\none he did find.\c\nAsked he, “Why do you hide?”\c
To which the Pokémon replied...\c\n“If you bear your sword to bring harm upon us,\nwith claws and fangs, we will exact a toll.\c\n“From your kind we will take our toll, for it must\nbe done.”\c
“Done it must be to guard ourselves and for it,\nI apologize.”\c\nWould you like to keep reading?
To the skies, the young man shouted his dismay.\c\n“In having found the sword, I have lost so much.\c\n“Gorged with power, I grew blind to Pokémon\nbeing alive.”\c
“I will never fall savage again. This sword I\ndenounce and forsake.\c\n“I plead for forgiveness, for I was but a fool.”\c
So saying, the young man hurled the sword to the\nground, snapping it.\c\nSeeing this, the Pokémon disappeared to a place\nbeyond seeing.

Ramanas Park is so scintillating! Coming here to\nstop and smell the roses always calms me down.\c\nRamanas roses symbolize the joy of journeys.\c\nSpeaking of journeys, I’ve heard that Legendary\nPokémon travel here from many different regions.\c\nIt’s probably the Ramanas roses’ alluring charm\nthat draws them here!
Welcome to Ramanas Park!\c\nThis place is a tourist attraction that’s famous for\nthe Ramanas roses blooming all over.\c\nIt’s also where top-notch Trainers gather from\nmany different regions.\c\nYou might say Ramanas roses attract those who\nare strong—now that’s what I call flower power!

Are you all right? I don’t know what you’re doing\nback here so soon, but don’t run yourself down.\c\nTake a nice rest.
I came here with my dad to look at the flowers.\nI’ll take pictures with Pokémon while I’m at it!
My daughter loves Ramanas roses.\c\nA day doesn’t go by without her demanding we\ncome see them.
The smell of Ramanas roses isn’t the only selling\npoint here—the people and Pokémon drawn\r\nfrom all over are spectacles in and of themselves,\r\nand those intriguing, enigmatic caves fill me\r\nwith excitement!
Those caves in the park have enigmatic\npedestals inside...\c\nIs there any purpose for them, I wonder?
I came all the way out here to see rare Pokémon,\nbut this place has a weird atmosphere.\c\nI feel like I could lose my sense of time\nand space...
Ramanas Park...\c\nIt’s a quiet paradise that draws you closer to\nPokémon that come from faraway lands.\c\nI especially look forward to seeing Pokémon from\nKanto and Hoenn, but it tugs at my heartstrings\r\nto know they’re so far away from home.
You chose the perfect outfit for the weather!\c
There is an enigmatic pedestal. You may be able\nto use a slate on it...

My scarf was blown away by the wind. I wonder\nwhere it went...
Thank you very much for finding my scarf. But I’d\nlike you to have it.\c\nMy attachment to the scarf seems to have blown\naway, too.

Stunky! It was you!\c\nIt seems I focused my search on the ground too\nmuch. Well, I’ll let you have it.
If a Pokémon with a Zoom Lens uses a move\nafter its target, the accuracy of the move will\r\nbe boosted.
Hmm. My boyfriend lost his lens. Where did\nit go?\c\nI’ve been looking for it with my Wide Lens, but...
Oh, Stunky had his lens. Sorry for getting you\ninvolved in this.\c\nPlease take this.\c

Oho... I see you’ve beaten the Elite Four.\nThen you can now have your Lv. 100 Pokémon\r\nundergo Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any\nBottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
See the Sticker Merchant there?\c
He didn’t have the Stickers I wanted today...\nMaybe tomorrow, I guess.
He came through with different Stickers today!\nJust what I wanted to see!
Oh, hello. You’re quite the nifty Trainer.\c\nMy husband is a sailor, and he’s off working\nsomewhere far away.\c\nI long for the day he comes back to me.\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
All that waiting every day gets to be very\nboring, though...\c\nI know! How about you visit me and I will tell you\nstories every so often?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Starting tomorrow, please visit and I will tell you\nsome of my stories.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Today is Monday!\c\nIt’s time to get going on a brand-new week.\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Is there a story that might help perk us up?\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Exeggutor, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Apparently, when Exeggutor absorb sunlight,\nit makes them grow. On Mondays, depending on\r\nwhether it’s rainy or sunny, we ourselves will have\r\na totally different mood, right?\c\nI’d never Exegg-tly thought about that until\njust now! You get it, right? Ahaha!\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Did that help you perk up?\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
You received the [VAR 0126(0003)].\c
You put the [VAR 0126(0003)]\non [VAR 0101(0001)].\c
Let’s talk again tomorrow.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hello!\c\nOh, this is the [VAR 0101(0001)] I gave a Ribbon\nto before.\c\nI’ve got lots of Ribbons, so you should bring\nother Pokémon to see me.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Today is Tuesday!\c\nThe first date I went on with my husband was on\nTuesday, too. I remember my heart thumping!\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hmm, heart-thumping stories...\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Drifloon, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
You might be outside chatting, totally absorbed,\nuntil you realize it’s right behind you and get a\r\nhuge shock.\r\nThat’ll Drif-initely get your heart racing!\r\nYou get it, right? Ahaha!\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c
Did that startle you?\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
Looks like today’s Wednesday!\n*sigh*\c\nMy husband bought me a dress, but I put it in the\nwash by accident and it shrunk.\r\nOh, how I weep for it still...\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Misery does love company. Should we have a\ngloomy story?\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Cherubi, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
I was talking to a Cherubi I know. I guess it was\non the verge of evolving when, suddenly, a Starly\r\nplucked off Cherubi’s nutrient-filled ball.\r\nOf course, the Cherubi was really down about\r\nthe whole thing, so I tried to boost its spirits,\r\ncrying, “Cher-up, you can do it!”\r\nYou get it, right? Ahaha!\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c
I hope that’s not too gloomy for you.\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
It’s Thursday already? I lost track of time!\c\nMy favorite magazine comes out today.\nI’d better go buy it quick!\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Do I know any stories about being\nabsent-minded?\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Slowbro, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Slowbro is said to have evolved by carelessly\ngetting its tail bitten by Shellder. I guess that\r\nShellder can be a bit bro-blematic, eh?\r\nYou get it, right? Ahaha!\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c
Ahh, I’m so absent-minded!\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
Today is Friday!\c\nMy meager store of anecdotes is about to\nrun out!\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Is there a story that would help me get my\nthoughts in order?\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Shinx, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
I once encountered a Shinx and it lit up with this\ntotally blinding light. I could practically feel it in\r\nmy head! Honestly, it wasn’t the most pleasant\r\nexperience I’ve had...\r\nThere are some Shinx I’d like to forget.\r\nYou get it, right? Ahaha!\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c
I bet your thoughts are in order now, right?\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
*yawn*\nToday’s Saturday.\r\nI’m feeling lazy and sleepy.\c\nI wonder if I have a story that would help\nsomeone sleep well?\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Abra, right?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Abra are fine with sleeping up to 18 hours\na day, Abra-rently.\r\n...Oops! I said the pun too early! I guess I’m still\r\nhalf asleep myself!\c\nWhat a whoopsie. What a whopper of\na whoopsie!\c
I’m not gonna sleep well if I keep going like this.\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
Oh, hello! You’re on your adventure even though\nit’s Sunday!\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
When I was younger, I remember that every day\nwas like an adventure.\c\nIt was always fun. I loved the people around me.\nI was happy...\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
I wonder if I have a story that’d make you smile...\c\nOoh, I know! You know how there’s a Pokémon\ncalled Chansey, right?\c[VAR 0114(0036)]
Chansey is said to share its healing eggs with\ninjured people. Consider yourself lucky if you\r\never have the Chansey to meet a Pokémon\r\nlike that!\r\nYou get it, right? Hmm.\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\c
Did I get you to crack a smile?\c\n...\n...\r\n...\r\nI did, right?\c\nHere, you can give this to your Pokémon.\c
Have you gone to the Grand Underground\nlately? Depending on where you go down,\r\nyou end up in different places.\c\nThat’s why I use my Explorer Kit in as many\nplaces as I can.
The spheres found in the Grand Underground\nare like gems.\c\nYou can obtain goodies by trading spheres away.
Head to the Grand Underground and have fun\ndown there. Make it an adventure!
The Underground Man in Eterna and Byron of\nCanalave are related.\c\nAdd Byron’s son Roark, and you have a trio of\ndedicated diggers.
I’d heard that Team Galactic was up to no good.\c\nBut here in Sunyshore, we’ve never even seen any\nof them around.
A long time ago, there was a boy named Cyrus\nwho lived here.\c\nHe seemed to shun others, and he preferred the\ncompany of machines.\c\nHe was a brilliant student, I recall. I often wonder\nwhat became of him.
That glaringly bright and cool thing you have!\nIt’s undoubtedly a Pokétch!\c\nThey’re awesome, yeah?\c
I got OK’d by the Pokétch Company to develop\noriginal Pokétch apps.\c
Hey, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you? Can you do me\na favor?\c\nYou’ve got Pokémon with different Natures,\nright? May I see them?
What am I in the mood to see now...?\c\nI’d like to see a Pokémon with a Serious Nature.
What am I in the mood to see now...?\c\nI’d like to see a Pokémon with a Naive Nature.
What am I in the mood to see now...?\c\nI’d like to see a Pokémon with a Quirky Nature.
Yep! Your [VAR 0101(0000)] has a Serious Nature,\nall right!\c\nThanks! I’ll give you this Calendar app for\nyour Pokétch.\c
Yep! Your [VAR 0101(0000)] has a Naive Nature,\nall right!\c\nThanks! I’ll give you this Dot Artist app for\nyour Pokétch.\c
Yep! Your [VAR 0101(0000)] has a Quirky Nature,\nall right!\c\nThanks! I’ll give you this Spinner app for\nyour Pokétch.\c
Someday, Pokétch apps may outnumber all the\nspecies of Pokémon.
...\n...\c\nSo, you’re the latest challenger up against the\nSunyshore Gym?\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
All right, I’ve decided!\c\nIf I find you to be weak, I’m going to challenge\nthe Pokémon League.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
I’m all done with renovating the Gym, so I don’t\nneed to be here.\c\nMore than anything, I want to have battles that\ncan thrill me again.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
As the toughest Gym Leader in Sinnoh, I’m going\nto unleash everything in my arsenal on you.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
You took a look through the binoculars.\c
The Vista Lighthouse represents safety and\nprotection to us sailors.
I love how far away you can see with\nthe binoculars.\c\nI’m going to go that far away with my Pokémon\none day!
Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be?\c\nLet me check out your Trainer Case and see\nhow many Badges you have...\c
One, two, three... Whoa!\nYou’ve already got seven Gym Badges!\c\nThat means if you can beat this Gym Leader,\nyou’ll be headed to the Pokémon League next.\c
That also means this is the last time I get to give\nyou advice.\c\nThis is it, kiddo! Listen carefully...one last time!\c
The Gym Leader here is a master of\nElectric-type Pokémon!\c\nThat’s all I have to say. The rest is up to you!
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you beat the\nGym Leader?\r\nWell, of course you did!\c\nBut, you know what? You haven’t made it in my\nmind yet!\c
Do you know why?\c\nBecause you and your Pokémon are capable\nof achieving so much more!\c\nI am proud of you, kiddo! Eight Sinnoh Badges!\nWay to go!

Sunyshore City Pokémon Gym\nGym Leader: Volkner\c\nCertified Trainers: [VAR 0100(0000)]\n[VAR 0100(0001)]
All right, challenger.\c\nIt’s not often a Trainer manages to make it all the\nway here to challenge me.\c\nAnd when they do, they’ve all been boring\nbattles. I didn’t break a sweat beating them.\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
*sigh*\nI’m Volkner, the Gym Leader.\c\nThey say I’m the top Gym Leader in Sinnoh, but...\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
Anyway, I guess we’d better get this done.\c\nI hope you’re the Trainer who’ll make me\nremember how fun it is to battle!\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
...Hehehe.\c\nHahahah!\c\nThat was the most fun I’ve had in a battle\nsince...I don’t know when!\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
It’s also made me excited to know you and your\nteam will keep battling to greater heights!\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
This is your eighth Gym Badge.\nYou’ve earned this!\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
You received the Beacon Badge from Volkner.
That Beacon Badge lets you use the hidden move\nWaterfall from your Pokétch.\c\nWaterfall happens to be key if you’re going to\nthe Pokémon League.\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
Also, because you’ve collected all eight Badges,\nany Pokémon at any level will now obey you\r\nwithout fail.\c\nI want you to take these, too.\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
Each [VAR 0109(0000)] contains the move\n[VAR 0107(0001)].\c\nIt may raise Sp. Atk if it lands. It’s pretty hot.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Your next step is the Pokémon League challenge.\c\nIt’s time for you to cross the sea and win your\nway through the gauntlet that is Victory Road.\c[VAR 0114(0037)]
Demonstrate to the Pokémon League your\nmastery of your team.\c\nAgainst you, even the Elite Four will be pushed\nto fend off your challenge![VAR 0114(0037)]
Yo! Fellow Trainer!\c\nThere’s no masking that aura of serious toughness\naround you and your Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
Oops, sorry, I should introduce myself.\c\nThe name’s Flint! I’m one of the Pokémon\nLeague’s Elite Four!\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
I just had this idea. Maybe you can pull it off.\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
It’s about this city’s Gym Leader.\c\nHe’s really lost his enthusiasm lately because\nthere’ve been so few good challengers worth\r\nhis time.\c\nHe’s so bored that he spends all his time\nrenovating the Gym.\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
And then the blackout happened... That sure\ndidn’t help lift his mood.\c\nYou know where I’m going with this, don’t you?\c\nI need you to give him a battle that’s so hot, it\nwill reignite his passion for battling.\c\nI’m counting on you, hotshot!\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
Yo! Hiya! He hasn’t come back yet.\c\nWhen he does, you know what you’ve\ngotta do—give him a battle that’s so hot it’ll\r\nreignite his passion for battling!\c\nI’m counting on you, hotshot![VAR 0114(0038)]
Yo! Hiya! He’s finally come back!\c\nHe seemed to be feeling upbeat, too.\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
I have a hunch that he recognized your toughness\nright away.\c\nI bet he’s getting excited over the thought of\nbattling you.\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
Remember what you have to do, hotshot.\c\nGive him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his\npassion for battling!\c\nAll right, hotshot! I’ll be waiting at the\nPokémon League!\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
Er...\nUm...\c\nM-my name is Jasmine, and I’m a Gym Leader.\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
Oh, I’m sorry, not the Gym Leader of this city...\c\nI’m a Gym Leader in the Johto region...\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
Er...\nUm...\c\nIt would be nice if you knew about the\nJohto region...\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
Oh, if you don’t have this city’s Gym Badge,\nyou’ll be forced to turn back.[VAR 0114(0039)]
Oh, that’s this city’s Gym Badge. You must be\nvery good.\c\nEr...\nUm...\c\nP-please take these, too.\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
Each of those Technical Machines...\ncontains Waterfall.\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
If you use Waterfall from the Pokétch, you’ll be\nable to get to the Pokémon League.\c\nUm... I-I don’t know how I should say this, but\ngood luck.[VAR 0114(0039)]
This city makes me feel at home somehow.\c\nIt’s next to the sea, and there’s a lighthouse...\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
I came from very far away because I wanted to\nget stronger.\c\nOn the way, I met all sorts of people with\ntheir Pokémon...\c[VAR 0114(0039)]
They all looked like they were having fun. I felt\nhappy seeing it.[VAR 0114(0039)]
That giant rock... Isn’t it actually a Pokémon?
The Gym Leader uses too much electricity!\c\nHe needs to think about the city’s power\nneeds, too!
The city uses a lot of electricity, especially the\nlighthouse and the Gym.\c\nThey finally decided to turn all the roads inside\nthe city into giant solar panels.\c
Sunyshore is the Sunshine City, so the system\nworks perfectly.
This is a major port town.\c\nIt’s also the gateway to the Pokémon League.
Whatever the environment, people and Pokémon\nadapt to live there.\c\nThat’s what we all do to survive.

Hey, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you? Can you do me\na favor?\c\nYou’ve got Pokémon with different Natures,\nright? May I see them?
I’ve heard some things about Victory Road,\nwhich leads to the Pokémon League. The word\r\nis the road is harsh and harrowing.\c\nI’d better load up on as many items as I\ncan carry...
You can buy Stickers for decorating Poké Balls at\nthe Sunyshore Market.\c\nUse those Stickers in a cool way, and your\nPokémon will be really happy.
Let me size you up...\c\nYou’re going to become even tougher.\c\nYou’ll meet many, many Pokémon.\c
That’s what you should be thinking.\c\nEventually, your world will grow even larger!
...I’m Marley. And you are?\c\n...I see. [VAR 0100(0000)], will you help\nme, please?\c\nI want to get through this tunnel. Will you let me\ngo with you?\c[VAR 0114(003A)]
You decided to escort Marley!
...Pokémon shouldn’t be hurt. I’ll heal them.[VAR 0114(003A)]
...You took so long. Please don’t make me wait\nlike that.\c\nI felt a little forlorn, all alone here...\c[VAR 0114(003A)]
...You’re going back. That’s too bad.\c\n...Bye-bye.\c[VAR 0114(003A)]
...Oh! This is it. There’s a stone tablet ahead.\c\n...I wanted to see the Pokémon that visits it—\nthat’s all.\c\n...I appreciate your escorting me.\n...At least a little.\c[VAR 0114(003A)]
Pokémon League\nThe Pinnacle of Trainerdom!
Pokémon League Ahead
Victory Road Ahead
Victory Road... It lives up to that lofty name.
It broke me once—but that only added to\nmy resolve!
Hold it! Don’t go off without me!\c\nYou’re challenging the Pokémon League,\naren’t you? That’s why I’m here, too.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Let’s see who’s more worthy of making the\nchallenge with a battle!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I guess I’m not ready for the Pokémon League if\nI’m losing to you! Darn it!\c\nJust you wait! I’ll get tougher and win my way\nthrough the Pokémon League!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Because I’m going to become the toughest\nPokémon Trainer there is—the Champion!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! You’d better not lose to\nanyone before me!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Let me confirm that you are qualified to\nchallenge the Pokémon League.\c\nTo do so, I’ll need to examine the Gym Badges\nyou gathered from around Sinnoh.\c
Oreburgh City’s Coal Badge!\nEterna City’s Forest Badge!\r\nVeilstone City’s Cobble Badge!\r\nPastoria City’s Fen Badge!\c
Hearthome City’s Relic Badge!\nCanalave City’s Mine Badge!\r\nSnowpoint City’s Icicle Badge!\r\nAnd finally, Sunyshore City’s Beacon Badge!\c
Very well!\c\nTrainer, you’ve indeed collected all the Gym\nBadges of Sinnoh! Demonstrate the power\r\nthat brought you here, and go for glory!
Here at the Pokémon League, you will be facing\nthe Elite Four.\c\nIf you can’t beat all four of them in a row,\nyou’ll have to start from the beginning.
Your Pokémon are so calm even though they’re\ngoing up against the Elite Four.\c\nI like how they’re so loose and relaxed.
Hello! Welcome to the Pokémon League!\c\nI’m Aaron of the Elite Four. It’s good to\nmeet you.\c[VAR 0114(003B)]
Oh, I should explain—I’m a huge fan of\nbug Pokémon.\c\nBug Pokémon are nasty-mean, and yet they’re\nbeautiful, too...\c[VAR 0114(003B)]
Would you like to know why I take on\nchallengers here, in this room?\c\nIt’s because I want to become perfect, just like\nmy bug Pokémon!\c\nOK! Let me take you on!\c[VAR 0114(003B)]
I lost with the most beautiful and toughest of the\nbug Pokémon...\c\nWe lost because I wasn’t good enough.\c\nThat’s it! Back to training camp! Let’s hear it\nfor me!\c[VAR 0114(003B)]
No... That was wrong... Anyway! Go on to the\nnext room!\c\nThree more Trainers are waiting for you.\nThey’re all tougher than me.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Go on—go to the next room.\c\nWith my beautiful and tough bug Pokémon, I’m\ngoing to become a top-level Trainer who can’t\r\nbe outclassed![VAR 0114(003B)]
Well, well.\c\nYou’re quite the adorable Trainer, but you’ve also\ngot a spine.\c[VAR 0114(003C)]
Ahaha!\nI’m Bertha.\c\nI have a preference for Ground-type Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(003C)]
Well, would you show this old lady how much\nyou’ve learned?\c[VAR 0114(003C)]
You’re quite something, youngster. I like how you\nand your Pokémon earned the win by working\r\nas one.\c\nThat’s what makes you so strong.\c[VAR 0114(003C)]
Ahahaha!\nI think that you can go as far as you want.[VAR 0114(003C)]
The Trainer in the next room is a much more\nformidable opponent.\c\nYou really must have your wits about you.\c\nHowever, I think you can go as far as you desire.\c\nAhahaha![VAR 0114(003C)]
Yo, Trainer!\c\nYou had me counting the days on my fingers\nwaiting for you to come.\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
I heard from Volkner what you did in Sunyshore.\c\nYou managed to light a fire in that guy’s\nheart again.\c\nHow could you not expect me to look forward to\nseeing you in battle?\c[VAR 0114(0038)]
...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nWhew. Burnt right down to cinders...[VAR 0114(0038)]
...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nMove along.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Ah, you timed your arrival well. I’ve just finished\nreading a book, you see.\c[VAR 0114(003D)]
Allow me to introduce myself.\c\nI am Lucian. I am a user of Psychic types.\c[VAR 0114(003D)]
I must say, you’ve already proven yourself to be\noutstanding by coming this far.\c\nThey say I am the toughest of the Elite Four.\nI’m afraid I will have to go all out against you\r\nto live up to that reputation.\c[VAR 0114(003D)]
Congratulations. You’ve now beaten the\nElite Four.\c\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you’re done with the\nPokémon League.\c[VAR 0114(003D)]
There remains the Champion.\c\nI should warn you—the Champion is far stronger\nthan the Elite Four.\c[VAR 0114(003D)]
Now, go on. Step through the doorway to your\nfinal battle.[VAR 0114(003D)]
I’ll be reading books until the next challenger\narrives. That will calm my nerves so that I may\r\ndeal with all situations without panicking.[VAR 0114(003D)]
Have you been keeping well? Thank you for\nMount Coronet. I’m truly grateful.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Together, you and your Pokémon overcame all\nthe challenges you faced, however difficult.\c\nIt means that you’ve triumphed over any personal\nweaknesses, too.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
The power you learned... I can feel it emanating\nfrom you.\c\nBut that’s enough talk. Let’s get on with why\nyou’re here.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
As the Pokémon League Champion, I accept\nyour challenge!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
That was excellent. Truly, an outstanding battle.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
You gave the support your Pokémon needed to\nmaximize their power, and you guided them with\r\ncertainty to secure victory.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
You have both passion and calculating coolness.\c\nTogether, you and your Pokémon can overcome\nany challenge that may come your way.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Those are the impressions I got from our battle.\c\nI’m glad I got to take part in the crowning of\nSinnoh’s new Champion!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Now then! Step onto the lift.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
One look at you tells me many things about you.\c\nTogether, you and your Pokémon overcame all\nthe challenges you faced, however difficult.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It means that you’ve triumphed over any personal\nweaknesses, too.\c\nThe power you learned... I can feel it emanating\nfrom you.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
That’s enough talking. Let’s get on with why\nyou’re here.\c\nI, Cynthia, accept your challenge as the Pokémon\nLeague Champion!\c\nThere won’t be any letup from me!\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
The room ahead is the Hall of Fame.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Your last battle was splendid!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Oh, hello, Professor Rowan.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hm! A child I enlisted for my Pokédex project\nhas come this far...\c\nIt’s only natural that I come and witness their\ncrowning achievement.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! I shouldn’t call you a child\nanymore. You’ve grown into a real Champion!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Professor, you still enjoy the enthusiasm kids\nbring to your research, don’t you?\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Step this way please, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Step this way please, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Professor Rowan, I need you over here as well.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It’s been a long while since I last entered\nthis room...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
No matter how many times I come here, I always\nfind myself standing up straighter than usual.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
If the last time you were here was when I became\nChampion, then yes, that would be quite a long\r\ntime ago.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It’s a natural reaction, Professor. This room is a\nlegacy to the hopes, dreams, and struggles of\r\nPokémon and their Trainers to excel.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]

[VAR 0100(0000)], welcome to the Hall of Fame.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Your names will be recorded for posterity here.\c\nWhat you are leaving are the memories of your\nadventure so far.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
It’s time to record your names.\nYou and your Pokémon.\c\nRemember, your Pokémon are partners that grew\nwith you through many challenging battles.\c\nThis machine will make a permanent record of\nyour achievement.\c[VAR 0114(001A)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s good to see you!\c\nWithout any further ado, I’d like you to examine\nthis stone tablet.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Something just like it was also discovered in the\nKanto region.\c\nI want to ask for your help in solving the mystery\nbehind it.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s good to see you!\c\nWithout any further ado, I’d like you to examine\nthis stone tablet.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Something just like it was also discovered in the\nKanto region.\c\nI want to ask for your help in solving the mystery\nbehind it.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I tried deciphering the stone tablet’s engravings.\c\nThe tablet appears to record the thoughts of\nTrainers who have grown through adventure.\c\nThat description would certainly apply to you.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why I’m asking for your help. You’ve met\nmany people and Pokémon, and those numerous\r\nexperiences have shaped you into who you are.\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I want you to sincerely consider who affected\nyou the most along your journey.\c\nTell me, to whom do you want to express\nyour thanks?\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hm... You most want to express your thanks\nto [VAR 0100(0001)]?\c\nYou’re absolutely certain of it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! What was that Pokémon? Is it somehow\nconnected to the stone tablet?\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmm... Where did that Pokémon go?\nIts destination is certainly intriguing...[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s wrong? You’re not suggesting there’s\nno one who made an impact, are you?\c\nTell me, to whom do you want to express\nyour thanks?\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! What was that Pokémon? Is it somehow\nconnected to the stone tablet?\c\nHmm... Where did that Pokémon go?\nIts destination is certainly intriguing...\c
The unmarked surface is polished like a mirror.
I-I don’t like to talk...\c\nI choose my words carefully, but they may still\nhurt someone by accident...\c\nWhen I think of that happening, I clam up...\c\nThat’s why I think this certain Pokémon is so\nwonderful. It’s a Pokémon that conveys\r\nfeelings of gratitude in a nice way...\c
That stone tablet... It has a strange feel to it...
Thank you...\c\nThat must have been the Pokémon that\nconveys feelings of gratitude...\c\nYou made it so I could see it...\c\nSo, I’ll have to convey thanks in my own\nwords, too...
To you, too...\c\nThank you...

Are you traveling as a form of training?\nHere, have this refreshing drink.\c
Water is the wellspring of life. Having said that,\nno one knows where Pokémon life originated.
Oh—hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]! What took you so\nlong? I’m fining you 100 million!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Listen up. I’m going to become the greatest\nTrainer ever. That’s why I’m here—to toughen\r\nup myself and my Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hehehe! Sorry, I couldn’t help overhearing that.\c\nBut the greatest Trainer ever? That’s going to be\nreally tough—because you’re talking about me!\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
To prove it, I’m going to the volcano right now.\c\nYou look puzzled. You really don’t know\nanything, do you?\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
All right, I’ll tell you. This is the Battle Zone,\nOK? At its far end is a volcano. And deep inside\r\nthat volcano, there’s supposed to be a treasure.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
So? What’s the big deal? If I find the treasure\nfirst, that’ll make me the greatest Trainer ever?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Then that’s what I’ll do, [VAR 0100(0001)]—\nand you too, stranger! That treasure is mine!\c\nBut before that, I’m going to the Battle Tower.\nSee ya!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
That guy just can’t stay put, can he? Anyways...\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
Howdy, I’m Buck. And if that punk thinks he can\nbeat me, he’s got another thing coming.\c\nSo, do you know that zippity-dippity Trainer?\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
You should chase after the guy and tell him not\nto underestimate the volcano.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Oh, but you know what? You’d better shape up\nat the Battle Tower first. I don’t like your chances\r\nof getting to the volcano otherwise.\c\nBe seeing you!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Howdy, Trainer! You have a Pokédex, do you?\c\nI bet the person who gave you that Pokédex is\nwaiting for you to fill it completely.
Howdy, Trainer! You have a Pokédex, do you?\c\nHere’s my advice: go out and challenge other\nTrainers! They’ll often have different Pokémon,\r\nso your Pokédex should fill up in no time flat!
The way the Battle Tower looms, it really is a wall\nthat stands before every Trainer.
I have battled many Trainers over the years,\nand I’ve gained some confidence in my skills.\c\nBut the world is still a huge place. In life,\nthere’s no such thing as an easy win!
Volcanic activity has caused the land around\nhere to become craggy.\c\nIt’s hard enough to hike over such rough terrain\neven without all the ups and downs.
The Pokémon League’s Elite Four come\nhere sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh, aren’t they?\c\nWe’re used to seeing some of those kinds\naround here.
There are no pit stops on the road to toughness!\c\nI just made that up, but it sounds pretty cool,\ndon’t you think?
What’s up? Do you want to sail to\nSnowpoint City?
Aye, right! It’s anchors aweigh, then!\c
Oh, right. I’m sure you’d rather just fly around\nlike you’re in some big hurry.
Whenever I travel somewhere new, I get excited\nover what I might discover.\c\nBut the places I’ve visited before? Even those\ncan thrill me with new discoveries!
Uh-huh! Nothing’s as superduper as a Super Rod!\nWouldn’t you agree?
Uh-huh! Superduper minds think alike. Take this\n[VAR 0109(0000)], uh-huh!\c
Try your luck at fishing wherever there’s water.
Don’t you like to fish?
What’s that? You want advice for fishing? Well,\nI’ll tell you—it’s all about the rod and technique!

Dang, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nOh well, that’s OK. The more you toughen up,\nthe tougher my team and I get, too.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
There’s no end to Pokémon training. That’s what\nI’m saying, [VAR 0100(0001)].[VAR 0114(0002)]
What items should Pokémon hold? It’s a question\nevery Trainer has to answer.\c\nHere’s something else to think about.\c
Now, which Pokémon will hold that Scope Lens?\nHave I given you more questions than answers?
An item that guarantees victory in every battle...\c\nThere are some things BP can’t buy.
The Battle Tower’s as tough as they say...\nIt’s no cakewalk, that’s for sure.
The best Trainers gather here—not just from this\nregion but from all around the world.
To strengthen myself! To strengthen my Pokémon!\nFor that alone, I have come!

Welcome to the Battle Park!\nIt’s your first time, isn’t it? Please step this way.\c
Since this is your first visit, you need to be given\na Point Card.\c\nPoint Cards are used only in the Battle Park.\nHere you go.\c
If you need information on the Point Card,\nplease ask the receptionist next to me.\c
I’m the one to ask if you need any information\non the facilities here in the Battle Park.\c
For information on the battle rules used at the\nBattle Park, please ask the receptionist across\r\nfrom me.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\c\nIf you need any information on the facilities, I’m\nthe one to ask.\c
What would you like me to explain?
The Battle Park is a place where Trainers may\nenjoy battles.\c\nThere are two facilities in the Battle Park: the\nExchange Service Corner and the Battle Tower.\c
The Exchange Service Corner is the building that\nlooks like a castle.\c
There, you may exchange the Battle Points (BP)\nyou’ve earned for items.\c
Fabulous prizes are offered, so please do visit\nthe Exchange Service Corner when you save\r\nup BP.\c
The Battle Tower is the building at the back of\nthe Battle Park.\c
The Single Battle Rooms are for conducting\none-on-one battles.\c\nThe Double Battle Rooms are for\ntwo-on-two battles.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\c\nI can explain how the Point Card and the\nBattle Points (BP) work.\c
What would you like me to explain?
Every Trainer visiting the Battle Park is provided\nwith a Point Card that confirms their\r\nchallenger status.\c
The Point Card stores Battle Points (BP) that you\nearn from battling in the Battle Tower.\c
BP, short for Battle Points, are used only in the\nBattle Park.\c
You will earn BP by hitting certain performance\ntargets battling at the Battle Tower.\c\nThe BP can be traded for prizes at the\nExchange Service Corner.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\c\nI can give you a rundown of the battle rules that\nare used at the Battle Tower.\c
What would you like me to explain?
In Pokémon battles at the Battle Tower,\nPokémon that are Lv. 51 or higher\r\nwill be set to Lv. 50 for the battles.
But be careful! Pokémon that are lower than\nLv. 50 will be left as is.\c
Excluding Eggs and certain exotic Pokémon,\nvirtually every species of Pokémon may enter\r\nthe Battle Tower.\c
Please be aware that the number of Pokémon\nyou may enter will depend on the course you try.\c
You are also permitted to take only one of each\nkind of Pokémon into the Battle Tower.\c
No two Pokémon in your party may hold the\nsame kind of item in the Battle Tower.\c
Please be sure that the Pokémon you bring to\nthe Battle Tower are all holding different items.\c
Good luck!
Welcome to the Battle Park!
No, thanks

The Battle Tower’s up ahead.\c\nI wonder what kind of Trainers are waiting there.
The Survival Area’s past here. Stark Mountain is\nthis way, too.
I should catch me some wicked Pokémon for the\nBattle Tower.
Even from here, we could see the peak of\nMount Coronet.\c\nMost people didn’t notice what happened up\nthere, but I did.\c\nBut I don’t know what took place exactly, or\nanything like that.
Everyone’s fanatical about battling.
The Battle Zone used to attract only the hardiest\nof Trainers.\c\nThey were considered eccentric for gathering at\na place like this.\c\nIt’s hard to believe how much it’s changed\nsince then.\c\nPlaces like the Fight Area and the Survival Area\njust seemed to spring up overnight.
He was one of those early eccentrics who were\naround during the first days of the Battle Zone.\c\nWell, I was, too.

Hold it right there, Trainer!\c\nSince you’re here, you’ve got to visit the\nBattle Tower.\c
You don’t earn Exp. Points, and your Pokédex\nisn’t updated there.\c\nIt’s a place solely for Trainers to hone their\nown skills.
Hold it right there, Trainer!\nHave you been to the Battle Tower?\c\nIt’s a good place to learn useful\nbattle techniques.\c\nYou get to see all sorts of Pokémon and their\nmoves, also!
Were you looking for me? Did you miss me?\c\nI wish I had a new nugget of wisdom to share\nwith you, but alas, I don’t!\c\nSo, I’ll have to make it up to you with this!\c
That’s my Nugget! Try to spend it wisely!\c\nA Nugget of gold has to be worth more than a\nnugget of my wisdom!

Welcome to the Battle Tower!\c\nI am your guide to the Single and Double\nBattle Rooms.\c

The Battle Tower’s Single Battle Rooms are\nfacilities for conducting Single Battles with\r\nthree Pokémon.\c\nSimilarly, the Double Battle Rooms are facilities\nfor conducting Double Battles with\r\nfour Pokémon.\c

In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await\nyour challenge.\c\nIf you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn\nBattle Points, or BP for short.\c
Until you challenge the fifth Trainer, you can\ntake a break during the challenge to step out of\r\nthe Battle Room and reselect your Pokémon.\c\nIf you stop your challenge after defeating five\nTrainers, you’ll have to start your challenge\r\nfrom the beginning.\c\nEither way, please note that if you don’t save,\nyou will be disqualified from your challenge.\c

I’m kind of stuck. They tell me there’s no\nshop here!\c\nHow am I supposed to get ready for the road?
You know how you can dig up cool\nstuff in the Grand Underground?\c\nPeople are saying they’re digging up new,\ndifferent stuff.
I spend a lot of time in the pool. Will I melt into\nthe water the way Vaporeon can?

Hello. Thank you for visiting us today. To which\nfloor may I take you?
Certainly. Elevator going up.\c
Certainly. Elevator going down.\c
Sorry, we are already on that floor.
Here we are!
The weather and the terrain here are much more\nextreme than what you’ll find in Sinnoh.\c\nI imagine there would be a large variety of\nPokémon here.
It’s not only Sinnoh’s best that gather at the\nBattle Tower. We’re talking about the greatest\r\nTrainers in the world.\c\nIt must be cool to get your own Pokémon and\nbattle against people like you from far and wide!
Wow, you’ve seen all the Pokémon in Sinnoh?!\c\nThat’s awesome! I’m gonna travel with Pokémon\nwhen I get big like you!
Wow, you’ve seen all the Pokémon in Sinnoh?!\c\nThat’s awesome! I’m gonna travel with Pokémon\nwhen I get big like you!
All I need to be happy is my TV. What more\ncould I want?\c\nI learn so much just sitting here. I’m\nabsorbing knowledge!\c
For instance, I learned all about a Pokétch app\ncalled the Marking Map.\c\nThey say the Marking Map can track Pokémon\nthat travel around from place to place.\c\nI’ve never met any traveling Pokémon myself,\nbut I’ve heard about them.
Yo, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]! Don’t tell me\nyou’re going to Stark Mountain, too?\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
You’re pretty wimpy... Are you sure you’re going\nto be OK?\c\nHeh, why am I asking you that? It’s not like\nI care.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Anyways, if we run into each other on Stark\nMountain, then the race is on to see who gets\r\nthe Magma Stone first!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Hey, traveling Trainer. Is your Bag full of items?\nOr is it full of dreams?
Trainers who lose at the Battle Tower come here\nto hone their skills.
I’ve been exploring a long time, but I know when\nI’m beaten.\c\nIt takes a better Trainer than me to explore the\nvolcano thoroughly!
I’m a cameraman, obviously.\c
Have you ever seen the TV program called\n“Search for the Red Gyarados: The Mysterious\r\nAppearance of the Furious Pokémon in a Lake”?\c\nYou know, that outstanding documentary?\nYeah, I filmed that!
Oh man! Oh jeez! Oh, this is bad!\c\nBut I’m a cameraman, obviously! I have to stand\nfirm and get this on film for the world to see!
I’m a cameraman, obviously.\c\n“The Eruption of Stark Mountain? The Mystery of\nthe Fiery Pokémon Asleep Deep in the Volcano!”\c
I’ve had that documentary all mapped out in my\nhead for a long time...\c\nBut I have nothing on film as of yet. So much for\nthat show.\c\nOh well. The world’s a huge place. There are\nplenty of other mysteries to catch on camera!
Survival Area\nStaging Point
A word of advice from a grizzled mountain man!\c\nBuy up as many items as you can hold in your\nBag. I’m not joking.
I was on a 54-win streak... If only I used that\nmove while I still had the chance...
I wasn’t experienced enough for the Battle Tower.\c\nTraining on Stark Mountain might be the only\nsensible choice—for some reason, all the best\r\nTrainers in Sinnoh seem to gather there.
The universe was made by something born from\nan Egg...\c\nA man I met long ago told me that.
Let me tell you about Stark Mountain.\c\nThat volcano dates back to when Sinnoh was\nmade by the melding of time and space.\c
Fiery lava spilled out and pooled, which then\nturned into a Pokémon.\c\nIt’s said that the Magma Stone was used to keep\nthe Pokémon under control.\c\nAccording to legend, the Pokémon transformed\nover time into the heart of the volcano itself.
You say the Magma Stone was found? Does that\nmean the legend was true?\c\nIf so, the Pokémon of the volcano may awaken\nand cause an eruption!
Heatran... So there really was such a Pokémon?\nDid it come to be when Sinnoh was created?
Gotcha, Gramps! I’ll put the Magma Stone back.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
That Magma Stone was keeping the Pokémon\nof the volcano under control.\c\nIt’s all right, though. I can go put it back myself.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Whoa, I can’t believe the Magma Stone put that\nPokémon to sleep!\c\nEven so, heheh, I have to admit you’re good!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
As for me... Next up, I’m off to the Battle Tower\nin my quest to be the toughest!\c\nBe sure to let your zippity buddy know I’ll battle\nhim there![VAR 0114(003E)]
There’s a move that doubles in power if the\nPokémon using it is poisoned, paralyzed,\r\nor burned.\c\nI’ve got Technical Machines for it right here.\nYou want them?\c
Facade’s a good move for your Pokémon to have.\c\nIt makes it tough for the opponent to use\nstatus-affecting moves.
You took the trouble of coming here? I’m sorry,\nbut there’s nothing!\c\nIt’s a sad day for me not to be able to share in\nyour joy!

Hey, konnichiwa! Glad to meet you—guten Tag!\nI’m the Meister.\c\nIn this language’s parlance, I would be called\na craftsman. Something like that, n’est-ce pas?\r\nComprendo?\c
So... *sniff sniff*\nI smell you! I smell something about you!\c\nThere is no question! You are a lover of\nPokémon, just like me!\c
This is wunderbar! So, here is what I will do:\nI will power up your Pokédex so you can read\r\nthe descriptions of Pokémon in other languages!\c
Je suis désolé, but it won’t work for all Pokémon,\nhowever. Only the Pokémon of regions that I, the\r\nMeister, have visited.\c\nNow, may I see your Pokédex? So, I change this\nsetting here...fool with this here...and done!\c
Huh? This Pokédex has already been updated!\c\nWunderbar! You’ve got technology ahead of its\ntime, and that’s muy bueno!\c\nBe sure to read lots of Pokédex entries from\nother countries!
Hey, konnichiwa! Bonjour and all the rest!\c\nHave you a Pokémon named Finneon? C’est un\nWing Fish Pokémon?\c\nIf you would be so kind, trade it will you for my\nprecious Magikarp?
Danke schön, domo arigato, muchas gracias,\nand what have you!\c\nThat Magikarp, it accompanied me from the land\nof my birth. Be good to it, I beseech you!
Oh non non, that is no Finneon! What I want is a\nFinneon. You have made the Meister melancholy!
Oh! This is a tragedy—a tragedy, I tell you! But\none day, you will trade me the Pokémon I want.\c\nThe Meister knows this because I have traveled\nthe world!
Because there are Pokémon all over the world,\nthe Meister can make friends anywhere.\c\nIt so inspires me knowing that. It’s merveilleux in\na marvelously maravilloso way!
It’s a poster that lists the names of Pokémon.\c\nThe world-traveling Meister’s favorite Pokémon:\c
Ekans, Pikachu, Psyduck,\nPonyta, Staryu, Magikarp,\r\nWobbuffet, Heracross, Sneasel,\r\nTeddiursa, Houndour, Wingull,\r\nSlakoth, and Roselia
Stark Mountain\nEruption Zone!
Darn it! What was that all about?\c\nOh, hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]. That Buck guy wiped\nthe floor with us!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Oh man... There are always tough Trainers\naround everywhere.\c\nBut you know what? Losing means I have room to\nbecome even tougher.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
That’s why there’s the Battle Tower in the\nBattle Zone.[VAR 0114(0002)]
Darn it! I’m still choked up from losing.\c\nBut you know what? Losing means I have room to\nbecome even tougher.\c\nThat’s why there’s the Battle Tower in the\nBattle Zone.[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]! Are you still raising\nyour Pokémon?\c\nMe? You need to ask? Of course I am—they’re\nmy partners!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I’m going to rule at the Battle Tower with them.\c\nI’ll prove how strong we’ve become and totally\nshock the guy there.[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey! [VAR 0100(0000)], right? Your buddy\nchallenged me to a battle earlier.\c\nYeah, I owned the little dude. Made sure he was\ntaught a lesson.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
But I don’t know if I could beat him again next\ntime. Seriously, you’re bound to run into skilled\r\nTrainers wherever you go!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Anyway, I found out about this place, but the\nPokémon here are tough...\c\nWhat do you say we team up and go together?\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
You decided to go with Buck!
You won’t regret teaming up! I’ll keep your\nPokémon healthy![VAR 0114(003E)]
So, yeah, the Pokémon here are tough... What do\nyou say we team up and go together?\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Whoa, wait up! I can’t go on by myself if you\nleave me now.\c\nWell, if you gotta go, you gotta go. I’ll stick\naround here for you.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
There we go! There’s the exit!\c\nMy instincts tell me that the volcano’s treasure is\njust ahead of us.\c\nYou might be the toughest there is—besides me!\nSee you around, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Hey, if we run into a Pokémon, I’m gonna\ncatch it somehow—because I’m gonna be a\r\nPokémon Trainer.\c\nYou know what a Trainer does, right? How they\nhave Pokémon battles and all that?[VAR 0114(0002)]
Pokémon all have different moves, huh?\c\nTrainers help their Pokémon in battle by telling\nthem which moves to use. It’s so awesomely cool.[VAR 0114(0002)]
I want a Pokémon of my own, and soon. That way\nI’d be able to go anywhere I want with it.[VAR 0114(0002)]
That lake has an elusive Pokémon living in it.\c\nEveryone says nothing lives there, but I know\nI’m right.[VAR 0114(0002)]
I’m gonna become a Pokémon Trainer for sure.\c\nNot just any Trainer, either—I’m going to be the\ngreatest ever. That’s my dream.[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey, that’s enough talking already. I’m itching to\nget going to the lake. Come on, come on![VAR 0114(0002)]
All right, let’s move out! Hustle up![VAR 0114(0002)]
We didn’t have any choice in using those\npeople’s Pokémon, right?\c\nBut these Pokémon belong to them.\nThey’ll want them back, won’t they?\c\nBut this is the first Pokémon I’ve ever\nbattled with.[VAR 0114(0002)]
I wish I could grow tougher with this little guy...[VAR 0114(0002)]
I don’t feel like talking... Let’s go.\c\nAre we maybe walking slower than when we went\nto the lake?[VAR 0114(0002)]
It’s startling to see two wild Pokémon appear at\nthe same time.[VAR 0114(0018)]
My Pokémon is an excellent healer.\nBut attacking isn’t its strong point.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], battling with you makes me\nfeel elated!\c\nIf I could predict what you’re about to do, we\nwould make a fierce combo![VAR 0114(0018)]
That’s some nice moss...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Thanks. You really helped me out.\c\nListen, I have a Pokémon here named Luca.\nWould you take it with you?\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
You’re very chatty...[VAR 0114(003A)]
The Pokémon among flowers...[VAR 0114(003A)]
Why do I like the volcano so much?\c\nI don’t really have a good reason for it, but I\ndon’t really need one.[VAR 0114(003E)]
There’s no law that says I have to be tough or\nanything, but losing isn’t fair to my Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
After all, they try so hard for me.\c\nI think it’s my responsibility as a Trainer to\nrecognize their hard work.[VAR 0114(003E)]
My big brother is one of the Elite Four.\c\nSo, of course it’s only normal that I’d be better\nthan ordinary folks.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
But that’s not what I want. I want to be tough on\nmy own terms.\c\nIt wouldn’t be fair to the Pokémon that chose to\nbe with me.[VAR 0114(003E)]
It might be cool being a Gym Leader or one of\nthe Elite Four...\c\nBut, then again, it sounds like it’d be a lot of\nhard work![VAR 0114(003E)]
Heheh! Check this out, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nThis is the Magma Stone, the treasure of\nStark Mountain!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Since I found it, that makes me the greatest\nTrainer out of everyone!\c\nThanks, you all helped it happen!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Oof!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Whoa! Wow! Hehehe! That was wicked!\nThe volcano’s in shock from that!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
It might be so shocked, it’ll erupt!\c\n...Nah, that can’t happen!\nSee ya, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nSay hi to that zippity Trainer buddy!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Gwogobo gwobobobo!\c
Heatran disappeared into the volcano...
Yo, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDon’t tell me you’re going to Stark\nMountain, too?\c\nYou’re pretty wimpy... You’re sure you’re going to\nbe OK?\c\nHeh, why am I asking you that? It’s not like\nI care.\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Anyways, if we run into each other on Stark\nMountain, the race is on to see who gets the\r\nMagma Stone first!\c[VAR 0114(003E)]
Oh, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s been a while!\c\nYou’ve grown so tough that you’re training out\nhere now.\c[VAR 0114(0044)]
Everyone keeps getting tougher and tougher.\c\nAnd, in doing that, they develop closer bonds\nwith their Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0044)]
For someone born overseas, this tough dude\ndoesn’t have an accent or anything.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], there’s a volcano ahead of us\ncalled Stark Mountain.\c\nThat blowhard Buck guy is on his way there,\nas well.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I’m going to find the volcano’s treasure before\nthat guy does.\c\nIf I could do that, a 21-win streak at the\nBattle Tower’d be possible!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You’re serious? You’re going to Stark Mountain?\c[VAR 0114(0044)]
Even the wild Pokémon there are very,\nvery tough.\c\nIf your Pokémon aren’t well trained, they’ll have\na miserable time.\c[VAR 0114(0044)]
Then again, that kind of challenge is an\nexciting prospect.\c\nBut no matter what, you’d better be\nfully prepared!\c\nI’ve got to get ready for another\ntournament. Farewell!\c[VAR 0114(0044)]

The ultimate moves! Shall I teach them to\nyour Pokémon?
To which Pokémon should I teach a move?\c
Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well. Visit if you have\na change of heart.
To which Pokémon should I teach a move?
That Pokémon can’t learn a move! Read the\nposter! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg? Impossible, even for\nme! Keh!
You’ve not bonded strongly enough with your\nPokémon! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows the move I’ve\noffered to teach! Keh!
I should teach [VAR 0107(0001)] to\nyour [VAR 0101(0000)]?

Would you like to give up on having this\nPokémon learn [VAR 0107(0001)]?

The blazing fire Pokémon: Charizard, Typhlosion,\nBlaziken, and Infernape.\c
The restless water Pokémon: Blastoise, Feraligatr,\nSwampert, and Empoleon.\c
The quiet grass Pokémon: Venusaur, Meganium,\nSceptile, and Torterra.
I spend all my time reading here. My son is an\navid reader, too.\c\nI recently learned that the word “universe” meant\ntime and space in an ancient language.
There are many old books here...\c\n“Space and the Galaxies”\n“The Beginning of Space”\r\n“Beyond Time and Space”
There are many old books here...\c\n“The Secrets of Psychics”\n“The Hidden Powers of Pokémon”\r\n“What is Psychic Energy?”
That Pokémon you met was the\nLunar Pokémon.\c\nI’ve heard tales of it flying from\nplace to place throughout Sinnoh.\c
Oh! That sparkle... That must be the\nLunar Feather!\c\nThank you. That will wake my son from\nthe nightmare.\c
Should we sail back to Canalave City?
Aye, aye! Anchors aweigh!\c
All right, then. Tell me if you’d like to return\nto Canalave City.
The Pokémon flew off somewhere.\c\nThere is something sparkling where the Pokémon\nonce was...
A voice called out from somewhere.\c
Darkrai. Your power is strong.\c\nThough you don’t will it, you make people and\nPokémon around you see terrible nightmares.\c\nThat is why you came here—Newmoon Island.\nHere, there is no one but you.\c\nThere are none that can be drawn into\nyour nightmare.\c\nAnd if anyone were to fall into the nightmares,\nFullmoon Island is close by.\c\n... ... ...\c
Do you wanna set sail?
Aye, aye! Anchors aweigh!\c
You just go on and tell me whenever you want to\nset sail again!
You are?\c\nOK, you’re [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’m Riley.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
I’m a Trainer, and yes, it is a bit odd that I would\nbe training here.\c\nIf you’d like, we could team up. The wild\nPokémon here are restless.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
You decided to go with Riley!
If your Pokémon get hurt, I’ll heal them up.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s team up.\nThe Pokémon seem to be restless.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
Are you going back?\c\nI’ll be hanging around here. It would be good if\nyou came back.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
I get it now. You’re responsible for agitating\nthe Pokémon. I don’t care what good reason\r\nyou may have, but I don’t want you bringing\r\nany trouble into my mine.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
We’re Team Galactic! We’ll take all the Pokémon\nwe want! Isn’t that right, partner?\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
You said it, brother! So that’s what we’re\ngonna do!\c\nWe’re abducting all the Pokémon from this\nrusted-out Iron Island!\c[VAR 0114(0017)]
To share in all the joys and all the sorrows...\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
That is how all the Trainers and Pokémon live\nin Sinnoh!\c\nI won’t allow anyone to defy that code of ethics!\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This is one battle\nwe can’t lose!\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
Stop! I said stop! Your combination is so sick!\nThe both of you—and your Pokémon.\c\nLet’s beat it, partner!\c[VAR 0114(0016)]
You said it, brother!\c\nWe don’t even know what Team Galactic’s big\nplan is anyway!\c[VAR 0114(0017)]
Thanks. You really helped me out.\c\nListen, I have a Pokémon Egg here...\nWould you take it with you?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Thanks! I’d like you to show the Pokémon that\nhatches from that Egg all sorts of new places.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
Thank you... But you don’t have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\c\nAll right, then. I’ll wait here for you.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I hope you’ll accept it as a token of\nour friendship.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]

Haha, I’d have to agree.\c\nYou might say the folks who train here have a bit\ntoo much time on their hands.[VAR 0114(0043)]
This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once\nupon a time.\c\nI guess the iron ore for steel was totally played\nout. There’s only Pokémon here now.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Have you met Byron? The Leader of the\nCanalave Gym?\c\nHe’s asked me to become a Gym Leader,\nbut there’s his son Roark to consider.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Imagine what it would be like for a Steel-type\nPokémon user to battle a Steel type.\c[VAR 0114(0043)]
Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder?\c\nI mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than\nanyone else.[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s going on here, though? The native\nPokémon are restless...\c\nI don’t like this. Let’s hurry.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hm? You’re in training, then?\c\nYou know, my son trains as hard as you do.\nBut I still treat him as if he were a child.\c[VAR 0114(0034)]
It’s ridiculous, really. He is a proper Gym Leader\nand all. It’s always tricky between a father and\r\nson, it seems.\c\nHumph, I’ve wasted your time. Take this as\nmy apology!\c[VAR 0114(0034)]
There are Pokémon that evolve into Steel types\nby using that Metal Coat. They need to hold that\r\nitem while being traded to evolve.\c\nTry using it if you’d like. Farewell!\c[VAR 0114(0034)]
What’s going on...?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You didn’t come this far\njust to go home, didja?![VAR 0114(0002)]
It’s here! The mysterious Pokémon of the lake![VAR 0114(0002)]
Professor, there isn’t anything out of the ordinary\non the other side, either!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor, there’s nothing out of the ordinary on\nthe other side, either!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmm... I may have been mistaken.\c\nSomething appears to be different than it was\nbefore, but...\c\nFine! It’s enough that we have seen the lake.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], we’re leaving.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Professor, how are you enjoying being back\nin Sinnoh? After being away for four years,\r\nit must be exciting again!\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor, you’ve been gone for four years now.\nHow are you enjoying being back in Sinnoh?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm... There is one thing I can say.\c\nThere are many rare kinds of Pokémon in Sinnoh.\nThe region should serve us very well in regard to\r\nour studies.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Excuse me. Let us pass, please.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
I beg your pardon... We’ll be on our way.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sorry, folks.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
What was that about? Those two...\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Huh? [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s go check this out!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
...\n...\c\nWhat’s that? Don’t go into the tall grass?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
No problem, no problem! We won’t be in there\nlong enough for a wild Pokémon to come out.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
It’s...a briefcase? Those people forgot it here.\c\nWhat are we supposed to do with it? We can try\nto return it, but who were they?\c\nI heard them say “professor”...\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Waaah! P-Pokémon?!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
What’s going on?!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Fwaaah! Your [VAR 0101(0001)] totally rocked!\c\nBut my [VAR 0101(0002)] was way tougher\nthan yours!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
They were other people’s Pokémon...\c\nBut we had to use them! Those people won’t\nmind, will they?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Oh! There’s the briefcase!\c\nThe professor would have been furious if I’d\nlost it...\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Huh? Oh, no!\c\nDid...did you use the Pokémon that were in here?\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
You did?! Oh my gosh! What’s the professor\ngoing to say? This is so not good...\c\nI’ll take this briefcase for now.\c[VAR 0114(0004)]
Whew! You found the briefcase?\c\nThe professor would’ve gone through the roof if\nhe knew I forgot it here.\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hunh? Whaaaat?!\c\nDid you guys... Did you use these Pokémon?!\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, man... How am I gonna explain this to\nthe professor?\c\nThis is the professor’s briefcase, so I’ll take\nit, OK?\c[VAR 0114(0005)]
What was that about?\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
I don’t know what’s going on. [VAR 0100(0000)],\nlet’s get out of here.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
My Pokémon got hurt from that battle.\c\nIf we get attacked by another Pokémon,\nwe might be in trouble.\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hmmm...\c\nNo Legendary Pokémon, and nothing seems out\nof the ordinary...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], how was Lake Valor?\nAnything to report?\c\nWhat? You’re just going there now? You’ve got\nto move faster than that![VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], how was Lake Valor?\nAnything to report?\c\nWhat? You’re just going there now? You’ve got\nto move faster than that![VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], how was Lake Valor?\nThere’s nothing wrong here.\c\nThe lake hasn’t changed at all. We haven’t found\na Legendary Pokémon, either, though...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hiya, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How’s Lake Valor?\c\nThere’s nothing wrong here. The lake is ordinary,\nas usual. There’s no Legendary Pokémon, either...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What timing!\c\nThose Team Galactic scoundrels are after the\nLegendary Pokémon! You’ve got to help Dawn![VAR 0114(0001)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What timing!\c\nThose Team Galactic scoundrels are after the\nLegendary Pokémon!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], hurry! You’ve got to\nhelp Lucas![VAR 0114(0001)]
How dare you! You misguided thugs!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Dawn needs your help![VAR 0114(0001)]
How dare you! You misguided thugs!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Lucas needs your help![VAR 0114(0001)]
Ow! Ouch! What’s with this old-timer?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s T-Team Galactic!\nOh, no! The Pokémon of the lake...[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s Team Galactic! They took the Pokémon of\nthe lake...[VAR 0114(0005)]
That face... It brings back bad memories!\c\nI’m talking about the Valley Windworks! I caught\na whole lot of trouble for that little incident.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
What’s with that look on your face? You do\nremember me, don’t you?\c\nFine, whatever. I’ll tell you who I am again!\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
I’m Mars, one of Team Galactic’s Commanders.\c[VAR 0114(0000)]
How cute! You two think you can save the day\nin your little game of hero?\c\nNot a chance! Not even a teeny one!\nYou’re all going down!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
I lost again...\c\nSo, first it was the Valley Windworks, and now it’s\nLake Verity that I owe you for! This shouldn’t be\r\nhappening to a Team Galactic Commander...\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
Calm down, Mars...\c\nI’ve done my part in all of this. My mission was to\ntransport the lake’s Pokémon to our HQ...\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s right! I accomplished my mission without\na problem!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
Team! We’re pulling out! The boss is waiting at\nthe HQ!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Pokémon of the three lakes are\nconnected somehow.\c\nThanks to Saturn’s grandstanding at Lake Valor,\na cavern appeared here. It was the cavern where\r\nthe Pokémon Mesprit slept.\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
Mesprit appeared, too, probably to go help\nits friends.\c\nThat worked out well for us. It was super easy\nto catch.\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, now we’ve got them all:\nMesprit, the Being of Emotion.\r\nAzelf, the Being of Willpower.\r\nUxie, the Being of Intelligence.\c\nNow that we have all three, you can look forward\nto what Team Galactic has in store for them!\c[VAR 0114(0012)]
I see... This also occurred at Lake Valor...\c\nAnother Legendary Pokémon was taken away by\nTeam Galactic...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Both of you went up against full-fledged\ncriminals—the fact that you’re unharmed\r\nis reason enough to celebrate.\c\n...But what about Lake Acuity?\nIs [VAR 0100(0000)] safe?[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], I need you to go to\nLake Acuity right away.\c\nI’m worried about [VAR 0100(0001)].[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], what is Team Galactic up to?\c\nAre the Pokémon they took from the lakes going\nto be OK?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], what’s Team Galactic up to?\c\nThey’d better not harm the Pokémon they took\nfrom the lakes...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyauun.\c[VAR 0114(0023)]
Mesprit flew off somewhere...\c
...\n...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], that was Mesprit, wasn’t it?\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
You’ve accomplished what I’d asked you to do at\nthe Canalave Library...\c\nI asked you to get data on the Pokémon of the\nlake, and you did.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
But it didn’t provide any answers about the\nmysteries of Evolution.\c\nI still don’t know why some Pokémon evolve and\nothers don’t. Ultimately, it only deepened\r\nthe mystery.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
But having mysteries to solve...\nThat adds to my enjoyment!\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], why don’t you chase\nafter Mesprit?\c\nTo me, it seemed as if it wanted to play with you.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
If you were to use the Marking Map app on your\nPokétch, you’d be able to track the movements\r\nof Pokémon.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
What? You don’t have the Marking Map app?\c\nYou should occasionally pay visits to the\nPokétch Company, you know.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’m sure that you will keep meeting countless\nPokémon and people.\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
Those encounters will keep thrilling you in their\nown special ways.\c\nI hope you’ll enjoy that experience!\nTake care, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
All right! To the lake!\nLet’s find us a red Gyarados!\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
You go ahead...\c\nI know we have to go return these Pokémon.\nThey’re not ours.\c\nBut I want to spend just a little more time with\nthis little guy...\c[VAR 0114(0002)]
Hey, hey! Where do you think you’re going?\c\nWe have to go return these Pokémon...\c[VAR 0114(0002)]

Hmm...\c\nYou’ve spotted [VAR 0202(0000,tagParameter=205)] Pokémon in Sinnoh...\c[VAR 0114(0001)]
What’s wrong? You’re not suggesting you’ve seen\nso few that you’re afraid to show me?[VAR 0114(0001)]
You’re working hard on your National Pokédex,\nI see. I expect big things from you![VAR 0114(0001)]
I see!\c\nYou’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I need to see you at my lab.\nI’ll be waiting![VAR 0114(0001)]
I see!\c\nYou’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh![VAR 0114(0001)]
Look harder for wild Pokémon.\c\nDon’t be afraid of going into tall grass.[VAR 0114(0001)]
Your pace is picking up. Things can only\nget better![VAR 0114(0001)]
Be persistent when you’re searching for Pokémon\nthat appear only in certain places.[VAR 0114(0001)]
Pokémon aren’t hiding only in tall grass. You can\nfind many others in caves and seas.[VAR 0114(0001)]
Your Pokédex is looking more and\nmore respectable![VAR 0114(0001)]
Are you fishing with rods? Pokémon that live\nunderwater need to be caught by fishing.[VAR 0114(0001)]
The Trainers that challenge you to battle have\nPokémon, obviously.\c\nThey may have rare ones with them, and that can\nadd to your Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0001)]
Your Pokédex is well on the way to being\nfilled up.\c\nThis Pokédex can be considered a journal of\nyour adventure.[VAR 0114(0001)]

Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is\ncoming along?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is\ncoming along?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmhm... You’ve caught [VAR 0202(0000,tagParameter=205)] so far...\c[VAR 0114(0006)]
I see...\c\nCome see me if you’d like me to have a look at\nyour Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0006)]
They say there are at least four hundred species\nof Pokémon nationwide.\c\nIf you’re planning to catch them all, you’d better\nbe a committed Trainer.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hm! Little by little, you’re filling the Pokédex\nwith complete data on Pokémon you’ve gotten.\c\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here’s a tip on catching Pokémon in the wild.\c\nMinimize their HP before you throw out your\nPoké Ball to catch ’em.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Remember: If you can’t catch them, you can\nalways trade for them.\c\nAs soon as you trade, the Pokémon’s data is\nadded to the Pokédex.\c\nThat’s why you should seek out as many trades\nas possible.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Have you visited the Great Marsh?\c\nSome Pokémon only appear in places such\nas that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
As you know, there are Pokémon that\neventually evolve.\c\nThat’s an important thing to consider when\nyou’re filling your Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ve proven yourself capable. There’s nothing\nto worry about.\c\nKeep catching Pokémon the way you’ve been\ndoing so far.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you aware that there is more than one style\nof Evolution?\c\nThere are some Pokémon that evolve by\nbecoming friends with the Trainer.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Apparently, there are some Pokémon that appear\nin swarms on occasion.\c\nDon’t miss out on these massive outbreaks\nof Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
Amazing! You’ve already gotten over three\nhundred Pokémon!\c\nThat’s already a major achievement, but I know\nyou’re capable of more![VAR 0114(0006)]
Some wild Pokémon only appear during certain\ntimes of the day.\c\nYou’ll need to look for Pokémon around\nthe clock.[VAR 0114(0006)]

There are also Master Class Single Battles\nand Master Class Double Battles.\c\nThey feature high-level opponents, and each\ntime you go on a seven-win streak ups your rank.
Thank you for playing!\c
Hmm?

Welcome to the Battle Tower!\c\nI’m here to guide you to a Master Class Battle\nRoom, either for Single or Double Battles.\c
Would you like to enter a Master Class\nBattle Room?
I look forward to serving you again.
We have two Master Class Battle Rooms: one for\nSingle Battles and one for Double Battles.\c
Seven Trainers will arrive in each Battle Room.\nThey are stronger than the Trainers you’d face\r\nin regular Single Battles or Double Battles.\c\nYou’ll earn extra BP if you can defeat them all.\c
Also, we use a rank system for the Master Class.\c
Master Class Single and Double Battles each\nhave 10 ranks. When you get a seven-win streak,\r\nyour rank will go up by one.\c\nOn the other hand, if you lose a certain number\nof times in a row depending on the rank, your\r\nrank will go down by one.\c
As your rank rises, your opponents will be\nstronger, but you’ll also earn more BP.\c
If you decide to take a break during a challenge\nthat is already underway, be sure to save your\r\nprogress, or your challenge won’t be counted.\r\nPlease don’t forget!\c
Would you like to enter the Single Battle Room\nor the Double Battle Room?

I’m here learning what it means to be strong!
Feeling a Pokémon’s trust in you... I think that’s\none meaning of strength.
I think Roark’s here, too, somewhere... Oh, I see!\nYou’ve already defeated my son!
Gwahahahaha! Like son, like father—well done\nbeating us both!
I figured if I trained here, I might get more—\nOh, what’s the word I’m looking for...dignity?\r\nWhatever it is that makes a Gym Leader cool!
Just wait—I’ll become a Gym Leader so dignified\nand cool that everyone will want to be like me!

What else is there to say? You came prepared to\nmake it to the top, and that’s just what you did!\c\nYou know, the thing I love most about being the\nTower Tycoon is taking in the view from up here.\c\nAs I look over all of Sinnoh, I think about how\neach day starts with a brand new Trainer taking\r\nthe first step on their Pokémon journey.\c\nThat thought alone fills me with hope, and today\nthat hope became reality when you defeated me!\c\nIf we continue this way, passing the baton down\nthrough the generations, then tomorrow will be\r\nas limitless as time and space itself!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], you were brilliant!\c\nNow you can truly declare yourself the winner,\nand carry Sinnoh into a shining future!
You can’t dismount your bike here.
In a Multi Battle, coordination with your partner\nis vital.\c\nBy working together, one plus one could become\nnot just two, but even three or four.\c\nBut one times one is always one.\nDo you understand that?

Yeah, I used to live in a place called Hoenn.\c\nThere was a place like this back there, too.

And now, on to the next room! My bug Pokémon\nhave already spread the buzz about your victory![VAR 0114(003B)]
Well, well.

Thank you for coming back, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAs you know, I am Sinnoh’s Champion.\c\nChampion... That word carries so much pressure.\c\nIt doesn’t happen often, but whenever a Trainer\ncomes to challenge me, I know that they carry\r\nwith them all their hopes and dreams...\c\nAnd so, I respect their passion by giving them my\nall in battle—without losing the dignity and poise\r\nexpected from the Champion, of course.\c\nForgive me for airing my petty complaints. I only\ntell you because you’ve defeated me before.\c\nBut I’ve said too much. The time has come!\c\nPlease do me the honor of battling my team with\nall your might![VAR 0114(001A)]

Here I come!
Yeah!\c
Bleah!\c
Hey, rookie! Bring it on!
Yeah, I knew it. You’re a rookie after all.\c
Bleah! You’re just a rookie!\c
I gotta say it—shorts are the best! They remain\ncomfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest!\c
I’ll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody!\c
I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!\c
What’s your policy?\c
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!\c
Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a\ngood thing?\c
I’m on the lookout for adorable clothes.
Let me know if you find anything nice!\c
I wish I could dress up!\c
I want to test out something I learned at\nprivate school.
Yes! It worked perfectly!\c
Hmm... Something’s wrong here.\c
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and willpower.\c
OK, so willpower doesn’t cut it on its own.\c
I study every day because I want to work\nall over the world.
My dream is worldwide!\c
I need to study up on Pokémon battles.\c
When I grow up, I’m going to be a\nPokémon Professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem! You’ve much to learn, youngster!\c
Er-hem! Er-hem! Seems I’ve much to learn still!\c
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply don’t lose!
It’s a victory of knowledge!\c
I’m going to review the subject—and I’ll subject\nyou to my revenge!\c
Oh, now you look wimpy. I might win this.
I so did it!\c
Ouch, that hurt.\c
It’s fine, fine. No need to say a word.
It’s fine, fine. You tried your best, I know.\c
It’s fine, fine... No need to say a word...\c
I’m rich!
Well, of course. I’m rich.\c
What happened? I’m rich, aren’t I?\c
Hmm. So, you’re good, huh?
Hmm. You’re no big deal. Hmm?\c
Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm.\c
Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
I’ve done it!\c
Oh, how disappointing.\c
Your adventure is over. Come hither and\nget whupped!
A done deal, it was.\c
Oh, how vexing this is. Verily, I thank you.\c
How boring...
So truly boring...\c
That was a good way to waste some time.\c
Huh? Where is everyone?
Hey, guys! Where are you?!\c
I came to camp, but I think I got separated\nfrom my friends...\c
Oh! You have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my Pokétch,\nbut I still won!\c
I was fooling around with my Pokétch,\nand I lost...\c
My Pokémon trained in the forest.
It’s the power of the forest.\c
I’m going back to the forest.\c
I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
Lalala!\c
Pretending this is a picnic won’t let me win.\c
Ooh la la! Here we come!
Ooh la la! So happy I won!\c
Ooh la la! Even losing can’t dampen my spirits!\c
I’ll teach you what’s fun about battling.
Battling me was fun, wasn’t it?\c
Oh my, that was inspiring! You’re the greatest!\c
I—I can swim, really! I don’t need my inner tube!
It—It’s true!\c
I—I’m not lying!\c
I like rivers more than the sea. Which do\nyou prefer?
River water is cold, but it feels just super.\c
I don’t like the sea because the salt water burns\nmy eyes!\c
Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
That’s the way! Way to go, my Pokémon!\c
Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon!\c
The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go,\n“Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\c
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash! Ker-splash!\c
Flip, flop!\c
I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!\nNice to meet you!
Thank you! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!\c
Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!\c
Oh yeah, I’m feeling it! I’m tuned in to\nyour wavelength!
Tadaaaah!\c
Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm!\c
Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything’ll do for my soundtrack!
*squeeeeeal*\c
So, yeah... You’ve got me in the mood for singing\nthe blues...\c
Let’s get this jam session on!
You’re obviously short on practice.\c
My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away...\c
Oh, hello... Well, aren’t you chic?
How about recommending me a shop?\c
Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable, you’re good\nwith Pokémon too! How unfair!\c
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh? You’re not my fan?\c
What a horrible way to treat an idol...\c
La, lala, lah.
La lalala. Lalalah lah.\c
Bye-bye, lalah!\c
Let’s see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon\ntrumped yours!\c
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger\nthan mine?\c
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
You don’t want to underestimate me.\c
You’re some kind of mighty.\c
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon’t be shy now, come on.
I see... Cute, but on the weak side.\c
I see! Cute, and yet tough.\c
My Pokémon are cute, but they’re not\nvery tough!
Oh? We won? Seriously?\c
It’s OK. I like my Pokémon. That’s all\nthat matters.\c
I’ve been pampering my gang too much lately.\nCan they do this?
Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on\nmy gang!\c
Pampering Pokémon too much is no good...\c
Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
There’re all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!\c
Join us! Become a Poké Fan like me!\c
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice—one loss served fresh.\c
Ah, an excellent choice—a win served fresh.\c
What I really hoped to become was a cook.
I don’t mind this job now, mind you.\c
I just find it hard talking to strangers.\c
For battles and order-taking, speed is essential!
Like, chop-chop! You got served.\c
Food is like battling. Serve it while it’s hot!\c
My job is about serving others. But don’t expect\nme to take orders here.
Mufufu.\c
Why couldn’t you serve me? You won’t make\nfriends that way!\c
See my uniform? Isn’t it cute?
It’s my favorite!\c
You messed up my uniform!\c
You’re good, aren’t you?
Oops. I’m a little disappointed.\c
I knew you were a tough Trainer.\c
I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
See? I’ve raised them pretty good.\c
I need to raise my Pokémon some more!\c
I’ll snag you with my net!
It’s in the bag!\c
Hey! Don’t run away!\c
Where can I find a giant Heracross?
I want a huge Heracross—like, king-size!\c
If only I had a giant Heracross...\c
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!\c
I lie shattered...\c
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Haha! You saw it!\c
You didn’t fall for my fake ninja boasting!\c
I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!\c
So, what’s a real ninja supposed to do?\c
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!\c
No! No tormenting me!\c
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn’t it cute?\c
My mommy is really good at sewing.\c
Let’s do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!\c
Waaaaah!\c
Sure, we’re going to battle, but don’t be over\nthe top about it.
Hey, relax, relax. It’s best to be natural, yeah?\c
You have to loosen up some more.\c
Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do! I’m gonna fish\nit all up!
Kahaha! I am at the top of my game!\c
Oh, waaah! I let that one get away!\c
Exploring ruins isn’t all fun and games!
Your skill level says you probably wouldn’t make\na good Ruin Maniac.\c
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!\c
These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
What do you say? Pretty tough, right?\c
Maybe it’s time we hit the road again...\c
Hey there! Check out my rare Pokémon!
My Pokémon aren’t just rare, either.\nThey’re tough, too!\c
Whoa! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don’t touch!\c
Now just be patient. I’ll show you my\nprivate collection!
See, see? Weren’t they awesome?\nThey’re the most super of the über!\c
Awawawah... M—My Pokémon...\c
Look! This is my favorite parasol—oh, and my\nfabulous Pokémon!
Aren’t they both cute?\c
I’m only showing you! You can’t have any!\c
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?\c
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things\nare in store.\c
If you were the weather, what would you be now?
Right now, I’m feeling sunny without a cloud in\nthe sky!\c
I’m feeling fogbound...\c
I really don’t like weak Trainers!
You don’t inspire much trust...\c
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting\nwith life!\c
Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry about...
Winning makes all my worries seem trivial!\c
You just added to my worries...\c
This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll be done quick.\nHold still!
There! Done!\c
Ooh, no! That hurts!\c
*sniff* *sniffle*
*sniffle* *snuffle*\nI think I have a cold...\c
*sniff* *sniffle*\nMy nose is clogging up...\c
*sniff*
Now what could this aroma be?\c
Are you wearing a fragrance? You smell sort\nof nice!\c
You’re going to lose, but you’ll get to enjoy\na nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That’s what you get for swooning\nto my aroma!\c
Argh! I am so angry!\c
Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
Yeahey!\c
Giyaaaah!\c
You should channel your feelings into songs\nwith sincerity.
The way I feel now? It’s rock ’n’ roll!\c
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.\c
Now hear me—I’ll tell you the Bird Keeper’s\nnumber one motto!
Soar high on a win!\c
Rest your wings on a loss!\c
Let’s both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!\c
Good going!\c
Fly, fly, fly! We’re going to rule this battle!
*zoooooom*\c
We’re gonna crash!\c
I’m the sailor among sailors! I was born on the\nhigh seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was\nmy mother!\c
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land,\nI get no-motion sickness...\c
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves...\c
I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big.\c
Yahoo!
Come on! You holler too!\c
Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up!\c
You should aspire to the hiker’s way of life!
You see? You love my lifestyle, don’t you?\c
Come on, now! You should look up to the way\nI live!\c
My Pokémon and I are idols!
Say what you will! We’re idols!\c
We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...\c
Watch me! All eyes on me!
Ooh... This is what I live for...\c
I became an idol because I wanted everyone\nto see me!\c
I’m too into battling... They might fire me from\nmy job as an idol...
Battling is too much fun!\c
I can’t help myself. No one can keep me\nfrom battling.\c
I run a marathon every morning. It’s great!
My buff physique makes for easy wins!\c
So I lost. I can still run great marathons!\c
I’ll run in place while battling for the good of\nmy health.
Let’s hear it for good health!\c
*gasp*\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!\c
Out of the way! I’ve got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?\c
All the delivering I do every day...\nI’ve got deep muscle pain!\c
It was me who put up the buildings around\nthese parts.
So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh?\c
My dream is to make a building taller than\na mountain!\c
Smell that? That’s the smell of hay clinging to\nmy body.
Whoa!\c
This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that\nPokémon surely love.\c
All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can\ntake it!
What, that’s all you’ve got? You can take a\nharder run at me!\c
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like you broke my\nbarrel chest...\c
I’m not getting any younger. I can’t\noverexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.\c
Oh, you’re good and young. There’s a sparkle\nabout you.\c
Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me,\nwe’re battling!
Owned!\c
Unbelievable!\c
These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with\nmy ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren’t they?\c
Well, I’ll be! We lost that one!\c
I’m going to do my level best. You’d better\nkeep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!\c
Yup! We tried hard, y’all!\c
OK, everyone! Big smiles!
Big smiles! Come on!\c
That’s a great smile! Your victory pose is\npicture-perfect, too!\c
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!\c
Zoom out, fade...\c
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock-hard...\nMy camera’s toughened me up.\c
Oof... I’m feeling groggy...\c
Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
Thanks for your help!\c
I appreciate the lesson!\c
I’ll do anything for a good news story!
I’m relentless about battling, too!\c
Stop! Please, stop! You’ll break my mic!\c
So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that what\nyou’re thinking?\c
I’m doing a live report on the topic of myself!\c
Come on! We’ll ride—together!
I beat you!\c
Wait! Don’t leave me behind!\c
Gear change! We’re attacking at top speed!
*vrooooom*\c
*kaboom*\c
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at full speed?
Too slow!\c
I’m taking it to a zone beyond speed!\c
I’d rather cycle casually than go full speed.
Let’s take it easy.\c
You ought to take things more casually...\c
I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!\c
Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from\nnow on!\c
My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my\nsweat cascades!
Hrrumph!\c
I sweated more. That makes me the victor!\c
En garde!
I’m still ready for more.\c
Urgh... I won’t forget this!\c
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!\c
You’re not bad, you.\c
Experience my ultimate technique in its entirety!
I am the greatest! Gwahahaha!\c
I’ve fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah!\c
Hi, little kid! A battle, please!
Little kid! Thank you very kindly!\c
Little kid! I’m really upset over this!\c
I, um... I’ve never actually learned how to\ndo karate.
You’re kidding! I’m naturally talented?!\c
Black belts are cool, so I just dress up like one.\c
It’s been five years since I took to the mountains.\nMy hair’s grown wild!
I bathe every day! How dare you?\c
Another five years...?\c
Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
You don’t appreciate the beauty of pure muscles!\c
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!\c
In love and in battles, I’ve never tasted defeat!
See? We won again!\c
So, I lost. I don’t care! I have a date soon,\nso I don’t care!\c
This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours!\c
Retreat! Sound the retreat!\c
My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years.\nYou think you can win?
Here’s a toast to my history!\c
My history of glory...\c
Are you prepared?
Ah, what a superb battle that was.\c
I tip my hat to you.\c
Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed? How adorable...\c
I see... You’re more than simply adorable.\c
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
*gasp*\nOh dear... I’m worn out.\c
Being rich doesn’t shield me from having worries.
Of course, being well off is much preferable to\npoverty, but still...\c
Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather\ntiresome, I must say.\c
Come to know defeat... Learn what it means\nto battle...
I see you becoming ever more powerful...\c
The defeated merely slink away...\c
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!\c
My power of suggestion failed to charm you!\c
...
Did it.\c
I focused my mind in silence...\c
My powers—there’s no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!\c
There really is no trickery...\c
Take it all!
Ahaha!\c
Gah!\c
Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my victory!\c
Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep.\c
I live among Pokémon.
I’ve never been much of a battler, but...\c
I’m just not much of a battler.\c
They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with my father...
Dad, are you seeing this? I did it...\c
Dad, I can’t... I need to raise them some more...\c
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time raising\nthose Pokémon!\c
Urgwah! Look what you’ve done to my Pokémon!\c
Will you have a look at the Pokémon I’ve raised?
Well? Cute, aren’t they?\c
Cut a girl some slack!\c
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?\c
Oh, but they’re so cute!\c
Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at\nyour peril!
Told you!\c
I guess I underestimated you...\c
Ahaha... I must say, I like the look in your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels, they are!\c
Your eyes shine brighter than any gemstone I\nkeep at home!\c
When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil,\nI must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth.\c
I daresay you’re quite the daredevil yourself!\c
If you want to run home to Mommy, here’s your\nchance, punk!
Geheheh!\c
Waaah! I want my mommy!\c
Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand—\nit’s about love!
I didn’t mean to battle—but take my hand!\nIt’s about love!\c
Battling is futile! Take my hand—it’s about love!\c
I dropped my glasses. I can’t see straight.
I guess I won. I can’t see enough to tell.\c
I guess I lost. I can’t see enough to tell.\c
Slow and steady. You build from the little\nthings up.
Slow and steady is how I won!\c
But I did things slow and steady...\c
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!\c
*sob*\c
Everybody gather around for my stupendicular\nPokémon show!
Wasn’t that amusing?\c
Nrrgh... I am not amused.\c
I shall train with you.
Show some spine! On your feet!\c
Fine! That will do!\c
Why get all intellectual about things? If it’s fun,\nwhy question it?
See, I can still win. I don’t see a problem!\c
So I lost. If it’s fun, it’s cool!\c
I expect you to be good... Don’t you\ndisappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...\c
You’ve got a good thing going.\c
My papa and mama are skilled Trainers, too.
It’s in my lineage!\c
Papa, Mama! I’m so sorry!\c
I go all out in battle, no matter what.
The inevitable conclusion!\c
I concede!\c
This is it—the biggest battle in my life!\nI cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!\c
This sets me back to being a lass...\c
My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger\nout of me!
I love to battle, too!\c
Ooh... I still love to battle, too.\c
Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a\nPokémon Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your skill level.\c
Yes, you’ve got the mettle. Being a Pokémon\nRanger is a lot of fun!\c
Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
Do you have any regrets?\c
I have no regrets!\c
It’s my sworn duty to protect nature and the\nPokémon in it.
It’s a challenging life, but there’s a lot to enjoy\nevery day.\c
It’s a rewarding career. How does it sound\nto you?\c
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
Well? Satisfied?\c
Well, aren’t you tough? I’m a little stunned!\c
I didn’t sleep while trying to come up with this\nnew strategy!
My strategy worked!\c
Oh... But I really needed to sleep last night...\c
The credo of the Dragon Tamer—number one!
In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon!\c
Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon!\c
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!\c
*urf*\nI wanted to be strong...\c
See it! Feel it! The ultimate power...probably.
There is no defeat for me, the ultimate...\nprobably...\c
The title of the ultimate...probably... I confer it\non you!\c
Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
Heheheh... That’s what you get for letting down\nyour guard.\c
Tch. Couldn’t fool you.\c
I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m quite good.
*ch-chatter*\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!\c
*ch-chatter*\nUrr... I’m getting sleepy...\c
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me! Not too shabby!\c
I like the sense you show!\c
Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!\c
I’m whiting out...\c
Don’t you think this coat is cute? It limits my\nmovements, though.
It’s toasty warm.\c
I feel snowed under...\c
I’m the one! Number one out of all the kids\nin shorts!
See? That’s what being number one is about!\c
Darn... I’m number one...\c
I’m the one! The only one true one among\nshorts-wearing kids!
See? That’s what being the only one is about!\c
Darn... I’m the only one...\c
Um... I’m pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.\c
Er, um... Th-thank you...\c
Here goes!
Bravo!\c
*yelp*\c
You will also learn!
The harsh realities of battling!\c
The joy of victory!\c
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.\c
I get it now. In that situation, I should have used\nthat move.\c
My teacher gave me advice on battling.
My teacher was right! That was just so easy!\c
Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked!\c
Why are we battling? I don’t get it.
Why? I don’t understand.\c
Why did you win? What happens now?\c
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand.\nYou know who’ll win, right?
I’m not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.\c
But how... My... The Pokémon I’ve raised...\c
There isn’t anything that I can’t buy.\nMoney can even buy victory!
There’s nothing that money can’t buy.\c
I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll let me win.\c
You know, I’m really not cut out for this\nsocialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!\c
You swine! Now I’m steamed!\c
I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!\c
Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse myself!\c
*crunch*\n*crunch*
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...\c
So itchy!\c
The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!\c
All hail Bug Catchers!\c
Feast your eyes on the secret techniques of the\nancient ones!
See? What did you think? Are you awestruck?\c
That’s my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke.\c
I see it!
Think not ill of me...\c
Gyoeeeh!\c
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!\c
Pika pi...\c
A battle, you say? I’m never losing to you!
Yeehaw! Yippee! I won, I won!\c
Urk... We lost...\c
It’s my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!\c
Ugagaah! You rotten thief!\c
You can shake hands with me! It would be quite\nthe honor for you!
If you’d won, I would have even given you\nmy autograph!\c
My management team will have something to say\nabout this!\c
Run! Don’t think! Run!
Faster! More! More! Faster!\c
Run! Keep running for me!\c
Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
All right. Nice seeing ya.\c
All right. Thanks for coming by.\c
My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
I landed another big one today!\c
Why the emperor of fishing? It’s an\nancient legend...\c
When you get as good as me, you can win easily,\neven if asleep.
*zzz*\c
*sssnore*\c
My mom and I travel around in search of\nlost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops.\c
You sure seem to be hectic.\c
Win! That’s what I’ll do again today!\nI’ll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI’m not gonna lose for my whole life!\c
Nooooo! No way! I didn’t lose!\c
Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
You’re still wanting. I urge you to keep at it.\c
That’s quite the collection. I’m willing to relieve\nyou of the lot.\c
Yah, yah, yah!
Yesss!\c
Owowowoooh!\c
I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
I love music!\c
Let’s hear it for an encore!\c
Battle? I’m up for that.
Wow. Good stuff.\c
Thanks much.\c
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!\c
I’m gonna pluck you for that!\c
Sure, let’s duke it out!
Let’s battle again!\c
You’re not half bad!\c
Looking out over the sea’s breaking waves...\nIt revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar! Daddy!\c
Wroaaaar! Mommy!\c
Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
So, what’d you think? Was I too burly for you\nto handle?\c
Good job! Way to overcome my size!\c
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind’s not into this yet!
Huh? It’s over already? What? I won, you say?\c
Huh? It’s over already? What? I lost, you say?\c
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
Wahaha! I get the win! Let’s celebrate over\nsome Moomoo Milk!\c
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some\nMoomoo Milk!\c
Stop right there!
Hah! I’ve still got it.\c
I can’t believe I let myself down like that!\c
I’m a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform would suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.\c
I must say, battling is a wonderful thing.\c
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the next.\nThat’s how it goes.\c
I might win tomorrow. That’s what I believe.\c
I’m throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!\c
It’s over!\c
The indefatigable camper makes his stand!
You can become a devotee if you’d like.\c
I wish I could become your devotee.\c
I don’t think I have any chance of winning,\nbut sure, I’ll battle.
Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win.\c
I knew I’d lose. I’m so sorry for this.\c
You’re awfully interested in me, aren’t you?
You lost because you were paying too much\nattention to me.\c
Why did you win? I thought you liked me.\c
Win or lose, let’s not bear any grudges.
Yay, yay, yay! We did it!\c
Oh, you! Don’t ever forget this!\c
Pokémon are for grown-ups, too.\nLet me show you...
What do you think? Am I deep like an old\nblues man?\c
Even though that wasn’t fun, I can handle it in a\nmature way.\c
What I have here isn’t really a guitar.
*beep* *boop* *bzzt*\c
This here is a keyboard synth.\c
For work, I sometimes get to be a swimmer or\na beauty.
An idol can become anybody!\c
But the real me... I’m still a lass in a miniskirt!\c
Let’s enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do\nwith pain!
Ooh! That was fun!\c
Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough!\c
I’ll put an end to this—with my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and\nperfectly strong...\c
Why? Why?! Why did I lose?!\c
Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
Ehehe... Pokémon are the best.\c
It’s not a problem if I lose. I still have\nmy Pokémon...\c
I have my Pokémon. I don’t need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day.\c
Isn’t that the same for you? Isn’t it?\c
You wouldn’t guess it now, but I was the life of\nthe party in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.\c
I feel nostalgic for those days...\c
Do your best, my beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done! Papa’s proud of you!\c
My Pokémon are my beloved family.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which.\nLet’s do this!
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which,\nbut I’m sorry.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which,\nbut you’re sure tough!\c
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it’s over.\c
Too much for me to handle!\c
We’re going for the win! Hey-ho, let’s go!
Yay! Vavavoom!\c
Aww, we lost...\n*sniffle*\c
Let me introduce you to my cherished partners!
My cherished partners! How did you find them?\c
Awawa... My partners...\c
Winning and losing isn’t all there is to battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win.\c
The effort you put in is what’s important.\c
It’s no good to be too harsh... But pampering is\nalso out.
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and\ncomplex challenge.\c
Balance is key for raising good Pokémon.\c
I’ll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
Not good enough! Your training style’s not up\nto par.\c
This is impressive! You’ve raised your Pokémon\nreally thoroughly.\c
I’ll win. No lie.
See?\c
Huh!\c
Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah! I win!\c
Fwaah!\c
I’ve caught you now. Give up.
You weren’t bad. Let’s meet again.\c
How could this be?\c
Yo, yo! Let’s have a fun time!
Thank you! Let’s play again!\c
Thanks! Play with me again!\c
You’re no good at all. I’d better teach you.
No, no, this won’t do at all. Up on your feet.\nNever give up!\c
You’ve got good skills. You tried hard, too.\nExcellent!\c
I’m jacking up the power to max! All the way\nto 11!
Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric!\c
Eeyow! I got zapped!\c
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak! Keep trying!\c
Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch!\c
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That’s it?\c
OK... Quite remarkable.\c
Ahaha! Too bad for you! I’m your opponent!
Ahaha!\c
Aha... Ahaha...\c
Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
That was a good battle. I hope we can\nmeet again.\c
Whew... The dude wasn’t expecting to lose.\c
The power of nature! Let me show you!
This is the power of nature!\c
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don’t know what you’re\ntalking about.
See? I thought this would happen.\c
Boo! Boo! This is not right!\c
Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could\ndefeat me?\c
Fuhahaha! Let us meet again!\c
Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it!\c
Oh, no! That’s awful! What have you done to\nmy Pokémon?!\c
A battle is deadly earnest! We can afford not a\nmoment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!\c
I seem to have let my mind wander...\c
Hey!
Heeey!\c
Hey...\c
I’m tough, that’s all.
I won, that’s all.\c
I lost, that’s all.\c
Shaah!
Hwooh!\c
Hawah!\c
I’ve been here for years, but I never get tired\nof this.
You might not think so, but I’m still a kid. I’m in\nthe same grade as you.\c
I’d like to keep battling with Pokémon even when\nmy hair is gray.\c
Let me make one thing clear... You aren’t\ncapable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you\nbeating me.\c
How could this be? Only that girl with the\ninner tube has beaten me...\c
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days... So careless.\c
Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks.\c
I would like my children to become strong and\ndistinguished Trainers.
It wouldn’t do if my children were only as good\nas you...\c
It would be nice if they were as skilled as you...\c
Behold, you shall! Mystifying psychic power!
You see? Mystifying psychic power!\c
No, but... Mystifying psychic power!\c
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family! That’ll be enough already!\c
My beloved family...\c
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?\c
Ooorgh... My head’s spinning!\c
My big brother told me... Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it! My big brother’s plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower the\nfoe’s accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
I thought so! You are tough!\c
Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up!\c
Ah, welcome! I’m your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?\c
Thank you so much!\c
Hello. Whatcha having?
Thanks a million!\c
Be seeing ya!\c
I love cute customers like you! I’ll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way I served you?\c
Oh, but... I’m not done serving you.\c
*stare*
You’ve got something on your nose.\c
You’re cool, all right. I had to stare.\c
I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer like you to\ncome along.
Yup, you’re as tough as I thought. You even had\nme in trouble!\c
I knew it! You are a tough Trainer!\c
Now, how should I conduct this offensive?
Oh, now, I need a better effort out of you\nthan that.\c
Oh, you’re finished and content? OK, another\ntime then.\c
My Pokémon have a different taste from the\nusual bunch.
Did you notice the difference? My party has\nrich depth.\c
Did you notice the difference? My party is\nrefreshingly dry.\c
Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me!\c
Ooch... You’re too much to handle.\c
Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
Varrroooom! I’m not close to redlining!\c
Vrrr... Vrruuu... I’m flat out of gas.\c
*jingle jingle*
*skreeeech*\c
*thud*\c
It’s my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
No riding double, though!\c
I wish I had a boyfriend!\c
What’s your motive? What brought you here?
You lose. Now what will you do?\c
Play it again.\c
Let’s keep this match fair and simple.
I admire your technique.\c
I remain humbled...\c
You’re serious? A battle? Against me?
*cackle*\nYou shouldn’t have tried!\c
Double wow!\c
I’ll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
Ooh, baby!\c
So much for riveting your attention. My Pokémon\ndidn’t stand a chance!\c
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!\c
Waah! Wait for me!\c
Can you explain why I’m here?
I mean, who are you?\c
Why am I battling here?\c
My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in\nall Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it? Surprised, I bet!\c
How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do\nwith battling...\c
The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a\nbig battle.\c
I was born to fish and battle!\c
I came here on a ship. Big ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place.\c
You want to go to sea? In my ship, we will see\nwonderful things.\c
Huh? You’re my opponent? This is kind\nof unnerving...
I’m surprised... I didn’t think I’d win.\c
See, I told you... I thought you were tough.\c
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!\c
Thanks for your time!\c
Let’s be good sports about this! Big smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh, too!\c
I’m cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha!\c
Buck up.
Not bad.\c
You’re good.\c
The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
Take that! That’s my finishing move!\c
Oof... I felt your finishing shot.\c
Hey, you’re looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?\c
Hey, you’re kind of tough.\c
Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and\nmy Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!\c
Oh, wait! We’re not done singing!\c
I got tips from my online friends on how to best\nraise my gang.
I must thank my online friends. I don’t know who\nthey are, though.\c
This is no good! My online buddies let me down!\c
Can I have a moment? I’m trying to write\nan email.
I need to get home quick and check my email.\c
What do you think you’re doing? I want to go\nback to my email.\c
Father... Mother... Please watch over me.
Father... Mother... Were you watching?\c
Father... Mother... Please forgive me.\c
Can’t rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
I won, but...I’m still shaking.\c
Grr... I’m so angry I could cry.\c
It’s the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat’s the power of science!\c
It’s inconceivable... How could the power of\nscience be defeated?\c
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of\nour experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I’ll get my\nprofessorship now!\c
What kind of experiments? That’s classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
Goo-goo ga-ga.\c
Ga-ga...\c
Fwahahaha! You’ve come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!\c
Fwahahaha! You’re blessed to have your friends!\c
I’ll scrap you.
I’ll recycle you.\c
Think ecology. Think green.\c
Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
Bam! All done!\c
A battle while working... It’s a good way to take\na break.\c
I’ll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
I’ve done it! I’ve achieved my goal!\c
I tried the best I could! Thank you for\nyour encouragement!\c
A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
Did you understand what I’m trying to say?\nI guess you wouldn’t...\c
Did you understand what I’m trying to say?\nI guess you wouldn’t...\c
Hello, you there! Yes, you! Wait up a second, eh?
OK, kids shouldn’t be out at this time. Go on\nhome now, you hear?\c
That’s quite a Pokémon you have there!\c
*sssnork* *zzz*
Clefairy... *mumble*\nWait for me... *sssnork*\c
*mutter*\nEhehe... *ssssnore*\c
Let’s keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!\c
You’re quite the Trainer yourself!\c
A battle isn’t something you can calculate.
What’d I tell you? You win when you win.\c
What’d I say, huh? You lose when you lose.\c
There’s lots in life that doesn’t go the way\nyou want.
Yippee! Things went my way!\c
See?\c
There’s nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!\c
Farewell!\c
I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or shine.
Because of that, I’ve grown so very strong...\c
Won’t a tough Trainer—\nNo, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come...\c
This is for keeping the sun off.
I’m strong at battling, but I can’t take sunlight.\c
I don’t want to roast my skin.\c
My, aren’t you an unusual Pokémon?
Hmm, for some reason, I couldn’t catch you.\nSuch an odd Pokémon...\c
Oh, you’re a Trainer? You’re not a Pokémon?\c
Ready?
Cool.\c
Bye.\c
Beat me? Try again in another 10 years!
No spine!\c
You’re tough! You inspire me!\c
Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
*yawn*\nOh? Are we finished so soon?\c
*yawn*\nOh, really? I lost?\c
You’re sure you can handle me? I’m an\nultrastellar talent.
Don’t feel bad! I’m an ultrastellar talent!\c
You’re in the miracle-star class!\c
I live only for battles. Only victories give\nme hope.
Naturally.\c
Who are you?\c
Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what\nyou’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come\nvisit again!\c
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...\nI can live with that.\c
Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what\nyou’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come\nvisit again!\c
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...\nI can live with that.\c
Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
Think you can take down the next Pokémon like\nyou did the other ones?
No way! Not yet! Not giving up!
Wh-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
You avoided the long way around? Let’s see why\nyou’d do that!\c
Now I understand why you decided to battle\nwith me.
You should go whichever way you want—take the\nshortcut or the long way!
Only those who want to win can challenge a\nPokémon Gym!\c
Gggh... This is humiliating!
One day, I’m going to become a tough Trainer\nlike you.
You’re a Pokémon Trainer! I happen to be a\nPokémon Trainer!\c\nOur eyes met, so battle we must!\c
Too strong! Too strong!
Don’t be shy about talking to Trainers you’d like\nto battle. Pokémon grow stronger and stronger\r\nfrom battling.
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,\njust look!\c
Let’s have a Pokémon battle!\nHumph! But I’m gonna win!\c
You’re, like, wow!
It’s fun to battle others! I’m gonna battle all sorts\nof people!
Let’s have another Pokémon battle! This time,\nI’m gonna win!\c
I spy, with my little eye...a Trainer!\nA battle, please!\c
Oh, boo! I can’t win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out! I need to go\nto a Pokémon Center!
Oh, hi! I remember you, Trainer!\nA battle, please!\c
I’m full of energy because I get power from\nmy Pokémon!\c
Oh! My poor Bidoof and Zubat!
Avoid tall grass... Or avoid Trainers...\nDo you have trouble deciding?
You look familiar, Trainer. Can I have\nanother match?\c
We’re always together. I’ll show you how\nwe’ve bonded!\c
It’s got me down...
I don’t bear grudges over losing. But I promise\nI’ll get tougher!
I’m always with my Pokémon.\c\nActually, you’re always with your Pokémon too,\naren’t you?\c
Gimme a battle so I can see if I’m ready for the\nPokémon Gym challenge!\c
I guess it means I’m not ready for the Gym\nchallenge yet...
I guess if you don’t have a single Gym Badge,\nyou’re a total nobody...
I’m about to take the Pokémon Gym challenge.\nBut before I go, I wanna spar with you.\c
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the\nGym Leader in Oreburgh City!\c
Oh, I lost! Lalala!
I’m going to collect lots of Gym Badges! I’ll work\nwith my Pokémon!
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym\nLeader in Oreburgh City!\c\n...Did I show you already?\c
I found a Trainer while looking for\nsome Pokémon!\c
Hunh? You’re finished so soon?
I walk through tall grass until I find the Pokémon\nI want.
I found a familiar-looking Trainer!\c
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer... Do you want to\nhave a go?\c
Aww... I shouldn’t have battled in the first place.
I didn’t know you were so tough... I’m going to\ntrain harder, too!
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer! Will you give me\na rematch?\c
My dad gave me some Pokémon! They’re gonna\nwin for me!\c
But they’re Pokémon I got from my dad...
Who gave you your first Pokémon?\c\nYour first Pokémon is the one with the most\nfond memories, I think.
I’m gonna win this time with the Pokémon I got\nfrom my dad!\c
May I please trouble you for a battle?\c
Oh... You’re so strong...
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon was\nholding a Berry.
Oh, thank you for that last battle.\c\nMay I please trouble you for another one?\c
Say, what’s your opinion on bug Pokémon?\c
I’m not going to be able to explain the charms of\nbug Pokémon this way!
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do stuff like\npoison and paralyze, and they’re cute and cool.\c\nYou gotta believe me—they’re good!
So, listen. Tell me you’ve grown to like bug\nPokémon since we last met.\c
Let’s have a battle while smelling the aroma\nof flowers!\c
Even though I lost, I’m not angry because it\nsmells so nice.
Maybe my Pokémon will get scouted at the TV\nstation in Jubilife City.
You came back to me because you couldn’t\nforget the smell of flowers!\c
We can one-shot this Trainer, can’t we, Liz?\c
Oh, oh, oh?
Aww! That is so bad!
You only have one Pokémon? That’s so boring!
Oh! You’re that Trainer! Let’s get payback, Liz!\c
We’re the strongest in our class!\c
Oh, but, wait!
I wish I could be strong like you when I\nget bigger.
Um, will you battle with us? Me and Liv?
We’re the best in our class. We can’t be losers\nall the time!\c
How about a quick battle before I leave for\nEterna Forest?\c
That really dampened my spirits.
They say there are rough Pokémon in\nEterna Forest.\c\nI’d better be more prepared than this.
You’ve been to Eterna Forest already, right?\nHow was it?\c
It’s a long way between Floaroma Town and\nEterna City. So, let’s battle!\c
Wawawaah! I’m out of Pokémon that can battle!
With my Pokémon by my side, I’m sure any\ncamping will be a blast!
While I was enjoying camping, my Pokémon got\nall big and buffed up!\c
What kinds of Pokémon live around here,\nI wonder.\c
I’m shocked! How did I lose?
What can I tell you about Pokémon?\c\nWell, there are males and females. And some\nthat you can’t tell.
Oh, hi! We meet again! Have you seen any\nrare Pokémon?\c
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little?\c
Oh, boo! How insulting!
Listen very closely...\nCan you hear the cries of Pokémon?
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little again?\c
There’s no mountain here, but I’m dressed to\nhike! Gahaha! Here goes!\c
Oh, yeah! A refreshing battle that was!
You can find the same kinds of Pokémon in all\nsorts of places.\c\nThere’s no law saying a hiker can’t go searching\nwherever they please!
If you meet someone in the mountains, they’re\nno longer strangers.\c\nMeet them twice—they’re your friend!\c
Of all places possible, I’ve lost my way here.\c
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost the\nbattle, too.
From being lost in the mountains so long, I\nbecame a hiker.
I’ve lost my way again. I’m betrayed by my sense\nof direction.\c
Hey! I’m not trained to hold back!\c
I...I concede! You’re in a different class...
You taught me how I measure up! Thank you!
Hey! This time, I’m fully committed!\c
I love Pokémon that smell sweet. Like this\none—get a whiff of this!\c
Did you understand what I meant? Didn’t my\nPokémon smell nice?
If you plant lots of Berries, you can be\nsurrounded by sweet scents.
*sniff*\nOh? Your Pokémon smells nice!\c
Nothing’s biting, so I could use a break,\nI suppose.\c
Oh, well. I should’ve been a little more serious\nabout this.
!\c\nYank your fishing rod when that appears.\nThat’s how you fish.
All right! I caught some tough Pokémon. I’m\nready for battle!\c
I landed myself a feisty Trainer! Let’s go!\c
I let a big win slip away...
Do you have a fishing rod? Catch some big ones!
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught me a big one!\nLet’s battle again!\c
I fished up some tough Pokémon! Let’s have\nourselves a battle!\c
Losing has my emotions all knotted up!
My feet are tangled, too! Ouch! Ouch!
I’m going to win this time! I said I’ll win, and I\nmean it!\c
Yo! Having a good time cycling?\c
Hey, not bad, you!
Cycling Road’s teeming with Pokémon\nTrainers, too!
I’m sure I’ve seen your face before. Did we\nmaybe battle?\c
Hey! Watch where you’re going! Or did you want\nto challenge me?\c
My efforts were meaningless...
I might try racing through Cycling Road in one\nlong shot.
There you are!\c\nI’ve been riding in this spot so I’d get a rematch\nwith you!\c
Your bike is the type that can shift gears, huh?\c\nLet me see if you know how to ride it properly.\c
I crashed...
Huh? I was supposed to be checking if you know\nhow to shift gears. Why am I checking out\r\nyour Pokémon?
Let me see if you’ve learned how to ride your\nbike properly...\c\nin battle!\c
The bicycle can only take you as far as your\nenergy will allow.\c
*gasp*
My Pokémon is out of gas. So am I.\c\nI’m going to head home soon.
I got plenty of rest at home. I’m not losing\nthis time!\c
I worked up a good sweat riding! I’m feeling\ngreat! Let’s battle!\c
Whew! You worked us over.
Do you find yourself pedaling backward\nwhile going downhill?
I worked up a good sweat riding! I feel ready for\na rematch!\c
You and I, we’re both riding bikes.\c\nAnd you’ve got Pokémon. I don’t want to lose\nto you!\c
Oh, geez, I seem to have fallen off my bike.
Instead of a battle, I should’ve challenged you\nto a bike race!
I hate knowing you’ve beaten me. This time, I’m\ngoing to win!\c
I love my bike!\c\nBut I’m not very good at fixing flat tires.\c
Total wipeout!
I admire people who understand gadgets.\c\nI’m clueless about how my Pokétch works.
I want to practice repairing flat tires...\c\nBut I’ve been practicing with my Pokémon to get\nour revenge!\c
Some people compete over speed, and some\ncompete over technique.\c\nWhich kind are you?\c
You’re a speedy technician!
I enjoy the scenery.\c\nDon’t you think the area below Cycling Road\nlooks nice?
I polished up both my speed and techniques.\nCan you beat me now?\c
Whoa! You startled me! Well, we may as\nwell battle!\c
Your power startles me!
We hikers are bighearted guys! Losing doesn’t\nbother us!
Whoa! You startled me! We may as well have\na rematch!\c
I wear shorts the whole year! I’ve got energy\nto burn!\c
Having lots of energy isn’t good enough.
My Pokémon don’t wear anything. I worry that\nthey’ll be cold.
I wear shorts! I have lots of energy! I’m not losing\nto you!\c
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do my best, too!\c
Oh...we lost.
Did you know? You can dig up Fossils in the\nGrand Underground!\c\nThose Fossils can be turned back into Pokémon\nat the mining museum!
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do more than my best\nthis time!\c
Go do it, my Pokémon! I’ll work hard, too!\c
Oh...we lost.
I think we’ll go visit the TV station in\nJubilife City next.
Umm...you’re the Trainer who beat us before,\naren’t you?\c\nWe’re feeling good today, so let’s have\nanother battle!\c
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune!\c
Wahahaha! There’s nothing that I can do\nbut laugh!
Wahaha! Go ahead and laugh at me!
Wahaha!\c\nLaughter brings good fortune! Forgetting your\ngloves brings a cold!\c
I just got through Mount Coronet, but we’ve still\ngot fuel in the tank!\c
Whoops! Didn’t take much to beat us!
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City before\nheading to Mount Coronet again.
I just got through Mount Coronet, and who do\nI see? A Trainer who we’ve battled before!\c
OK, OK! Let’s be quick about this!\c
No way! Give us another battle!\n...Oh, right. I’m out of Pokémon.
Yup! I like the way you battle.
What took you so long? We’ve waited here a\nlong time for a rematch with you!\c
Gahahaha! You’re just a little kid!\c\nHow’re you supposed to beat a big man like me?\c
I’m a grown-up, but I got served by some\nlittle kid!
Wow, you’re sure impressive!\c\nI guess it makes no difference if you’re young or\nold in Pokémon battles.
Hey, you, tough little kid! Throw us a rematch,\nwill you?\c
They call me the Echo Man! Battle with me!\nYahoo!\c
Ohh...yo...yodelay...
Let the Echo Man give you a good word\nof advice!\c\nIf you don’t know where you should be going,\ncheck the Town Map.
Oh, hi there! Remember us? I’m the Echo Man!\c\nLet’s have another battle! Yahoo!\c
If I beat you, will you share some food with me?\c
We were starved for food, and now we’re starved\nfor a win.
*sigh* I feel even hungrier. Maybe I’ll chow down\nsome Berries.\c\nBut should I really eat Berries? What am I,\na Pokémon?
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch before we\nstarted climbing.\c\nIf I beat you this time, share some food with me!\c
This karate man will pulverize you!\c
I still lack power.
I need to work out more. My Pokémon does, too!
This karate man hasn’t forgotten being\npulverized by you!\c
Eee-hee-hee! I’ll haul you up and out!\c
My favorite word is “restraint.” Especially\nin battle.
You need a Good Rod if you want to catch\ngood Pokémon.
Eee-hee-hee! There won’t be any restraint this\ntime, OK?\c
Oh, you want to have a battle?\c\nI was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,\nbut beating you won’t take long.\c
Oh, you have us beaten.
You and your Pokémon have so much energy.\c\nI think you would do well in Super Contest\nShows, too.
Oh, didn’t we meet before?\c\nI was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,\nbut let’s have a quick battle first.\c
You and I!\c\nLet us create a scene—a fantastic tableau\nof battle!\c
Magnificent! I am aglow with inspiration!
That battle will surely become a stupendous\nmasterpiece painting!\c\nI shall title it...\c\n“Pokémon Can Win!”
The key to becoming a good painter is to\nbe observant.\c\nThe same can be said for battling—one must\nbe observant!\c
Let me see how much you’ve raised\nyour Pokémon.\c
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in\nimpeccable condition.
It’s obvious you raise your Pokémon with a lot\nof love.
I’ve raised my Pokémon since we met. How much\nhave you raised yours?\c
Listen, if you don’t mind, I’d like to have a battle\nwith your Pokémon.\c
*giggle* They’re raised with a lot of care!
If you treat your Pokémon with care, they’ll\nreward you with friendship and loyalty.
I don’t want to ever battle with people who don’t\ntreat Pokémon nicely!\c\nBut I know you treat yours kindly. I’ll battle\nyou anytime!\c
Hi, there! Where’re you from? What kinds of\nPokémon have you got?\c
Fancy folks like you have fancy Pokémon too,\nit looks like.
I hope my pa didn’t spy me slacking off from\nwork here.
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again? What kinds of\nPokémon’d you bring?\c
I jog every morning to keep my Pokémon fit.\c
Oops! You threw off my running rhythm.
Being healthy is number one! Why don’t you\ncome running with me?
Do you jog every morning, too?
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots of people.\c\nI have trouble remembering faces, but we did\nmeet before, right?\c
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon!\c
I’m so angry...
I want to be a Pokémon when I grow up!
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon!\c\nI think you already know, but we’re going to\nbattle again!\c
You’re not supposed to intrude on my time\nwith Sue!\c
I only have eyes for Sue. Maybe that’s why\nwe lost?
Sue, even in defeat, you’re so beautiful!
I don’t want to do anything without Sue...\c\nBring two Pokémon at least, OK?
Did you come back to intrude on my time\nwith Sue?\c
Huh? You want to battle with me?\c\nI will if I can team with Ty!\c
I’m sorry, Ty!
We lost. Ty, I need a hug to make it all better!
I only want to do things with Ty!\c\nDon’t you have two Pokémon?
Oh, it’s you again! I’ll battle if I can team with Ty!\c
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about\nrhythm, too!\c
In a sense, I suppose that was a finish line\nof sorts.
When your rhythm gets thrown off, everything\nseems out of whack.
When I was jogging the other day, a wild\nPokémon came after me.\c\nI ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear.
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about\nrhythm, too. Our rematch is also about rhythm!\c
We battle together! That’s why we’re tough!\c
Waaah!
You’re awesome! Are you maybe a\nPokémon genius?
We won’t play with you if you don’t have\ntwo Pokémon!
When I battle with Lil, we shouldn’t lose!\c
We’re gonna crunch and munch you all up!\c
Hwaaah!
We’re going to be tough Trainers, too!\nWe decided!
Only one Pokémon is too lonesome!
You munched us all up last time—but it’s our\nturn now!\c
Hey, check this out! Look at the luster of my\nPokémon’s fur!\c
Hey, hey, did you take a good look?
Every day, I brush my Pokémon a hundred\nstrokes. Then, I do me.
I brushed my party a lot. So we’d be ready for\na rematch!\c
I’m a rookie breeder, but I’ll do my very best!\c
It’s all right! I’m still a rookie!
How to raise Pokémon? Umm...it’s all about\nlove, right?
I can’t be a rookie forever. I’ve learned a lot\nsince we last met.\c
Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon!\c
Even with both of us, we lost.
Our mommy is a twin, too.
We want to battle with lots of Pokémon.
Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of\nPokémon again!\c
Yay! We’re gonna have a battle with\nthree Trainers!\c
We two couldn’t win.
When Mommy and Aunty and me and Teri get\ntogether, it’s really confusing and fun!
We want to have a battle with four Pokémon.
Yay! We’re gonna have another battle with\nthree Trainers!\c
My Pokémon toughened up from working on\nthe ranch.\c\nI’m right proud of them!\c
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be counted on!
When I touch my Pokémon, I can feel not just\ntheir bodies’ warmth, but their compassion.
Howdy! You’re that tough little Trainer!\nI remember you!\c\nCheck out my farm-toughened Pokémon! They’re\nmy pride and joy!\c
I’m warmed up and limber. I’m OK to battle!\c
Um... I wasn’t emotionally ready.
Actually, I wanted to make a run for it.\nThat’s a joke.
I’m going to keep running. Just as long as there’s\na road...
I’ve been training so I can have a rematch\nwith you.\c\nI’m OK to battle!\c
Uhohoho! I’ll show y’all how tightly I’ve bonded\nwith my daughter!\c
Parent-and-child power couldn’t get the\njob done.
I reckon the bonds between you and your\nPokémon are like the bonds parents share with\r\ntheir kids.
Oh, there’s no way you could beat us both with\none Pokémon.
Ayuh? You’re here to check the bond I have with\nmy daughter again?\c
I can get away with slacking off if I have my\nPokémon out!\c
Oh, sheesh!
Papa, I’m sorry! I promise I’ll work harder\nstarting tomorrow!
You’re battling me and my pa. One Pokémon\nwon’t cut it, dear!
Oh, hi! It’s good y’all came calling on us again!\c\nI can take a break from work if I’m battling\nPokémon. Lucky for me!\c
I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!\c
I concede defeat.
My cover is blown, so what should I do?\c\nMaybe I’ll go catch some Super Contest Shows\nin Hearthome City. Maybe I’ll do that.
Do you remember me? I’m one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!\c
I concede defeat.
While I hid in the tall grass, I sensed Pokémon all\naround me!\c\nFurtive sounds of movement...stifled cries...\nI heard them!
You don’t remember me? I’m one of the Ninja\nTrio! Being discovered means I must battle!\c
I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!\c\nBut how did you discover me? Don’t tell me\nyou’re a ninja, too!\c
I concede defeat.
A Pokémon Trainer’s good at finding stuff,\nI guess.
You should join us so we can form the\nNinja Quartet!\c\nAnyway, let’s battle!\c
You seem to have a lot of confidence. Let’s see\nif it’s justified!\c
Haha! A total loss for me!
You seem to have an abundance of talent.\nIt’s pretty amazing.
When I lost to you last time, I was just unlucky.\c
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take battles in stride.\c\nI need to stay cool and calm whether I win\nor lose.\c
Aiyeeeeh! We lost!
How dare you beat us! Go away! Go!
Last time, I got a little emotional over losing...\c\nI’ll stay cool and calm today!\c
Me, lose to someone so young? I daresay not!\c
The power of youth... It’s startling.
Somehow, it makes me happy seeing a young,\nyet surefooted, Trainer such as yourself.
The power of youth and the technique of\nthe Veteran...\c\nLet us battle again to see which shall prevail!\c
This buff physique isn’t just for show!\c
Ugwaaaah!
Why? Is it because my training wasn’t enough?!
My buff physique! Feast your eyes on it again!\c
I just startled you!\c\nWhile you’re still struggling to recover, I’ll\nalready be the winner!\c
What’s with you? You didn’t give me\nany openings!
I need a better reaction out of you. I feel silly\nhiding for so long!
You just saw me, and I bet you thought,\n“Long time no see.”\c\nWhile you’re still thinking that, I’ll already be\nthe winner!\c
We ninjas appear where you least expect us!\c
I didn’t expect to lose.
When I hide out like this, I think about what it\nmust be like for Pokémon inside their Poké Balls.
Wah! Another chance encounter with a foe who\ndefeated me before!\c
A ninja can use all sorts of cool techniques!\c
Hmm...my ninja techniques failed to work.
There’s a ninja Gym Leader somewhere\nfar away.\c\nI should become a devotee of theirs.
What’s with you? You’re not a ninja yet?\c
Don’t be shocked when you see my Pokémon!\c
Oh... My... Gosh...
Dragon Pokémon are usually much more powerful\nthan this!
You again?\c\nYou must really like that dragon Pokémon I use.\c
I’ll teach you about the charms of bird Pokémon!\c
Wow. I admit, I’m quite surprised.
The sight of you battling... It was simply a\nwonder to watch!
Do you finally understand the appeal of\nbird Pokémon?\c
Jen, watch this! I’m going to use everything\nyou’ve taught me!\c
Wow. Someone that’s even better than Jen...
I don’t care if I get to meet the greatest Trainer\nin the region. I’d still rather learn from Jen.
Wouldn’t you rather battle with the two of us?
This time, I’m not gonna let you down, Jen!\nI promise!\c
Here comes a Trainer. Zac, you ready?\nLet’s do this!\c
I just got embarrassed in front of my little\nbuddy here...
Zac, I’m so sorry. I’m a failure as your instructor.
Would you like to have a two-on-two Pokémon\nbattle with us?
Here comes our Trainer! Are you ready this time?\c
Look at these beautiful wings!\c
Oh, you! I’m going to peck you for that!
How come bird Pokémon have such\nbeautiful feathers?\c\nHold one up to the sun and you can see so many\ncolors in it.
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous wings.\c\nIt must have been some sort of a mistake that we\nlost last time!\c
“Zubat!” Doesn’t that sound like a ninja bursting\nfrom cover?\c
Oh! My Zubat tri-stars...
Sowing confusion among foes is one way a\nninja battles.\c\nA confused Pokémon can’t show its full power!
The shinobi live by speed! I’ll get in my attacks\nbefore you!\c
See how Mount Coronet towers above us. I want\nto be big like that one day!\c
A powerful presence towers before me—it’s you!
Mount Coronet has long been known as an\nancient and mysterious mountain.
Hmm?! You tower before me again?\c\nIt’s as if you’re Mount Coronet!\c
Hah! Hah! I’m psyched for this! Here goes!\c
I don’t get why we can’t win.
I guess I ought to study winning techniques for\na change.
Hah! Hah! This time, I’m psyched up!\c
Speed is a ninja’s best weapon! Can you\nkeep up?\c
I did a lot to conceal myself, too.
I’ll wait here for a weaker-looking Trainer and\nthen ambush them!
I became even faster! How can you hope to\nkeep up?\c
I go everywhere with my Noctowl. We’re gonna\nshow you owl best! Ha!\c
We did our best. That’s what matters. Right?
Even on cold days, just being with my Noctowl\nkeeps me warm!
I curled up inside my Noctowl’s wings and waited\nfor you to return!\c
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted a Trainer!\nI must investigate!\c
My investigation revealed the Trainer to\nbe tough!
Celestic Town is an old town. I’m sure to find\nsomething cool.
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted you again!\nI will now investigate!\c
I’ll have you know my Pokémon sleeps on a fancy\nimported bed.\c
Humph! There’s an unseemly sense of\ndesperation about you. Ugh!
Oh, my poor little battler is all tuckered out...\c\nI’ll let it sleep in that bed I had sent\nfrom overseas.
I do this only because I love my Pokémon.\nWinning isn’t that important.\c
I’d like to begin now. Are you quite prepared?\c
Oh, how very impressive of you.
Would you care to inform me of who the amazing\ntutor you’ve hired for your Pokémon is?
Oh, I’m delighted to see you again.\nAre you prepared?\c
If it pleases you, would you care for a Pokémon\nbattle with me?\c
Your handling of Pokémon is impeccable.
Bahaha! I was invited by the master of the\nPokémon Mansion.
If it pleases you, would you care for a rematch\nwith me?\c
I’ve never battled a young Trainer like you\nbefore. I’m quite nervous!\c
Oh, dear... That wasn’t anything like battling\nwith my friends.
Usually, I’ll have matches with members of my\nsocial club.
Oh, it’s you again, dear?\c\nIt makes me a little nervous, but may I have\na rematch?\c
Good evening, Trainer! Fancy a quick nighttime\nPokémon battle?\c
You’ve got tough partners with you. Carry on,\nTrainer. Carry on.
Out so late? Does your mother know you’re out\nat this hour?
Why, hello there!\c\nIt’s always nice when a Trainer stops and says hi\nto us police officers!
Good evening, Trainer! Now let’s see how our\nPokémon greet each other—in battle!\c
I was just wondering whether my Pokémon would\nhave a chance to battle tonight.\c
I guess I need to train my Pokémon some more.
More Pokémon training is always better.
Patrolling night and day sure is exhausting.\n*yawn*
What a pleasant, quiet evening.\c\nLet’s give our Pokémon some exercise!\c
Let’s enjoy a fierce battle in the chilly night\nwinds! Brrrr! Refreshing!\c
It was too dark for me to see very well. Yeah...\nToo dark.
Oops, I’d better get back to my beat before the\nboss radios me.
Hi! Hanging in there, Trainer?
Still training this late?\c\nI admire that kind of dedication, Trainer!\c
I’m on patrol to see whether or not there’s any\ntrouble afoot!\c
Big trouble! I need backup Pokémon!
Your toughness is too much!\nI’m in serious trouble!
Just between you and me, all this patrolling can\nget pretty demanding.
Let me ask you a question! Have you trained\nyour Pokémon as well as I have?\c
Can’t you see I’m fishing? Don’t talk! You’ll\nstartle the fish!\c
Sheesh...I let a Pokémon—and that battle—get\naway from me.
Fishing and battling are delicate things, as am I.\nIs that wrong?
You can see I’m fishing, can’t you? Then don’t\ntalk to me! Geez!\c
I wish some fishing-loving lady’d come along.\nBut no, it’s all just Trainers.\c
Sure, so I lost. But I’ll keep on fishing.
If you know of any ladies who like fishing,\nhelp me reel one in!
Umm...yeah. Weren’t you that person who\npreferred Pokémon over fishing?\c
Water Pokémon sure get happy when it rains.\nSo do I!\c
Oof. Just got trampled right under your feet\nthat time!
Yup, a kid like you should be running around\noutside, rain or shine.
I’ve been fishing here ever since I lost to you.\c
Can you keep up with us?\c
You’ve got energy to burn!
However hard you battle, make sure you never\nharm the environment.\c\nTry not to break any branches or trample any\nplants, OK?
Hey! You’re that high-energy Trainer! I bet you\ncan’t keep up with us now!\c
Are you doing your part to protect the\nenvironment? I am!\c
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted Trainer.
People, Pokémon—all of us! We’re all a part\nof nature.
Heya, long time!\c\nAre you enjoying your nature-filled adventure\nwith Pokémon?\c
Our job is to protect the natural environment of\nthis region.\c
We have to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here. I wish I could live\nout here.
What do you think? The environment is\nunharmed in this area.\c
I find it reassuring to be on this damp soil.\c
Ufufufufu...you had to beat me.
It feels good to mope here after a loss. Ufufufu...
Is Damp your favorite Pokémon Ability? Fufufu...\nAnything will do.\c
I’m proud of my Pokémon! Here, I’ll show\nyou why!\c
Youch! You sure showed me how tough\nyou were.
Oh, what have we here? That’s a Pokédex!\c\nIt records Pokémon data upon sight? I’ve never\nseen one before!\c\nI heard you can move the sun or moon icon to\ncheck the Pokémon habitat map by time of day!
I take down details in my notebook about\nPokémon I’ve battled.\c\nI’ll write more data down about your Pokémon!\c
Oh? Here comes a nice Trainer. This is\nworth evaluation.\c
Our research arrived at this one conclusion:\nyou’re tough!
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the\nGreat Marsh.\c\nYou see, countless years ago, this whole area was\nunder the sea.
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate how much\ntougher you’ve become since our last encounter?\c
There are Pokémon that become more powerful\nwhen it rains.\c
When I lose, my tears fall like rain...\nThey call me Rain Woman...
I want to show off my pretty parasol, but it will\nget dirty in the rain.\c\nOh, such a big dilemma!
On rainy days, I get more energetic!\c
When it rains, I get happy!\c
It’s not very easy trying to battle while holding\nan umbrella.
If it rained every day, I could have my umbrella\nopen all the time.
It’s not because it’s raining—I just love umbrellas!\c
My Pokémon and I are always prepared!\c
I was completely unprepared for this...
You aren’t just well prepared—you’re tough!
We’re on constant patrol. Even at night, it’s safe\naround here.
My Pokémon and I are better prepared this time!\c
I swim the whole year round. I’m not losing a\nbattle at sea!\c
I lost in the sea—but I swim the whole\nyear round!
When you’re out at sea, Water-type Pokémon\nlook more lively.
I love the sea. It was only by fluke that I lost\nlast time.\c
Brr...I’m starting to get chilly. I could use a win\nto get warmed up.\c
The chill of the sea...the coldness of defeat...\c\nIt’s a double whammy.
Look at my lips—they’re the color of prunes!
Brr...I’m starting to feel chilly. How about a hot\nPokémon battle?\c
Hi, wave-riding Trainer! How about a battle on\nthe sea?\c
You sure schooled me there.
Maybe I should switch to surfing, too...
Oh, hi again! You’re that wave-riding Trainer!\c
Hello, there! Aren’t you going to swim?\c
What’s saltier, my tears or the sea?
There aren’t many sea routes that you can swim\nin Sinnoh.\c\nIt makes me want to take a vacation in the\nHoenn region.
When I see people surfing, I don’t feel jealous\nor anything.\c\nI just simply love to swim!\c
Isn’t this nice? I love my inner tube!\c
I couldn’t move very well because my inner tube\ngot in the way!
My mom blew up my inner tube for me. I ran out\nof breath just opening it!
You can come back all you like, but you can’t\nhave my inner tube!\c
Eheheh...I can battle, too!\c
I lost, and now I feel hungry.
That cloud looks like ice cream! I wish I could eat\nsome! Mmm...
I’ve been lounging here all this time!\c
Traveling alone, are you? That’s impressive! How\nabout we battle?\c
You’re good, pip-squeak!
Maybe I’ll go work out down at the\nrestaurant again.\c\nThat place gets different people in every day,\nand they all like battles.
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let’s break the\nmonotony with another battle!\c
Awwww! I almost had that fish reeled in!\c
You need to have more respect for a grown-up.
You need to settle down some.
Awwww! I was just reeling that fish in!\c\nOh, no, not you again!\c
Let me demonstrate my technique. It’s how this\ngrown-up battles.\c
That’s how you attack? Pshaw!
You’re so much more of a Trainer than you look!
Give this grown-up another chance to\ndemonstrate her technique.\c
This area seems to be very mystifying. That’s the\nsense I get.\c\nTo show you what I mean, I’ll battle with the\nPokémon I found.\c
I can’t win with Pokémon that I’m not\nfamiliar with.
This area seems to be very mystifying. That’s the\nsense I get.
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\c\nI challenge you to battle with the Pokémon\nI’ve found!\c
I’ve been traveling around the world chasing\nstories on mysteries.\c\nIt’s made me pretty tough!\c
*sigh* That’s a downer.
There are mysteries waiting for me to investigate\naround the world.\c\nThis is no time to be feeling sorry for myself.
There’s an endless supply of mysteries around\nthe world.\c\nRunning into you here just happens to be one\nsuch mystery!\c
I’d sensed the presence of a Trainer for a while.\nIt was you!\c
Defeating you will be no easy matter.
Is it possible to become more powerful by\nunderstanding Pokémon?
I was certain that you’d return. I sensed your\npresence, you see.\c
Look out! Behind you! What is it?\c
My plan to scare you didn’t go over well at all.
You might be tough, but let down your guard at\nyour own risk!
Whoa! That thing curled around your neck!\c\n...Nice scarf, kid!\c
Win or lose...who knows how this’ll go?\c\nWe’re playing for keeps!\c
I guessed wrong too often.
I can’t get into the groove. That’s enough\nfor today.
I wasn’t lucky the other day. Things will be\ndifferent today.\c
For the sake of my collection, I take on people I\nknow I can’t beat.\c\nThat’s what a collector does.\c
You should boast more about that last attack.
I’m proud of having a Pokémon that others\ndon’t have.\c\nOh, and I’m also proud of winning the second\nprize on Jubilife TV’s daily drawings.
For the sake of my collection, I keep battling\npeople I can’t beat.\c\nThat’s what a collector does.\c
Whaaat? You do! You do have a Pokédex!\c
I’m so envious of your Pokédex.
Trainers have all sorts of Pokémon with\nthem, right?\c\nSo, the more Trainers you battle, the more your\nPokédex will fill up!
I don’t have a Pokédex, but that’s all right.\c\nYou come here and show me!\c
To find my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west,\nor any which way!\c
But they’re my favorite Pokémon!
If you’re trying to find the Pokémon you want,\nyou need to go everywhere!\c\nNot just east and west, either. South and north\nare important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or\nany which way!\c\nSaying that, I’ve been wandering around here all\nthis time.\c
Oh? You want to teach me something\nabout Pokémon?\c
Wow, is that right?
There are so many kinds of Pokémon. I can’t\ndecide which one to pamper.
Yoo-hoo, little kid! Can you teach me some more\nabout Pokémon?\c
I was snoozing, you claim? I merely feigned\nsleep! Hiyah!\c
*gurgle*
I feigned a loss! Hiyah!
Am I lost, you ask? I merely feigned it! Hiyah!\c
Check the sharpness of my Fighting-type\nPokémon’s moves.\c
You’ve dulled its sharpness...
Back to training for us!
I sharpened my Pokémon’s moves more for when\nI saw you again!\c
Every drop of sweat I shed makes me that\nmuch stronger!\c
I don’t want to believe this happened, but a loss\nis a loss.
Time to shed some more sweat!
We’re going to win this time! Don’t believe me?\nThen you test it out!\c
*huff huff huff huff*\nWant—*huff*—a battle? *huff*\c
*huff huff*\nWe—*huff*—lose. *huff*
Bye—*huff*—now. *huff*\n*huff huff huff huff*
Running—*huff*—is—*huff*—good. *huff*\nOver—*huff*—doing—*huff*—it isn’t! *huff*\r\n*huff huff huff huff*
*huff huff huff huff*\nWe—*huff*—meet—*huff*—again? *huff*\c
I’ll battle anyone. That’s how I’ll get better!\c
You won and I lost, but the both of us gained\nsomething from this.
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn’t matter how old or\nyoung you are.\c\nYour gender doesn’t matter, either. Nothing like\nthat means anything!
I’ll battle against people who’ve beaten me\nagain and again.\c\nBy doing that, we both grow a little as Trainers.\c
I’m taking the Veilstone Gym challenge.\nBut first...\c
You made me lose my confidence...
I think about Pokémon all day long. I was\nconfident, you know.
Oh, it’s you again!\c\nI’ve regained my confidence. Let’s have\nanother battle!\c
I’m a treasure hunter. Today, the loot is a victory\nfrom you!\c
I can’t win. You’re too much to take!
If one’s after treasures, maybe looking\nunderground is the better choice.
I’m a treasure hunter. This time, I will have my\ntrophy: a victory from you!\c
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...
Sticking to one’s own goal is more important\nthan it seems.\c\nIf you match your goal with someone else, you’ll\nlose your identity.
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk. I even stop\non occasion. I am human, after all.
Up till now, I’d maintained my pace.\nBut seeing you threw me off!\c
I’m an ace. I can see that you’re an ace, too!\c
Just as I thought...
You can pretend to be ordinary, but your eyes\ntell me another story.
A real ace doesn’t get hung up on getting wins.\c\nA real ace sets sights consistently higher to\nimprove themselves.\c
I always battle for keeps. This is no drill!\c
Good job! That was an excellent battle.
If you don’t play for keeps, you’ll lose battles\nyou should be dominating.
When I lost to you last time, I was battling\nfor keeps.\c\nBut this time, I really mean it. This is seriously\nfor keeps!\c
I’m fully kitted up and equipped! Anytime will\nbe fine!\c
Hunh?!
Perhaps I should maybe change into a more\ncomfy outfit...
I’m fully equipped again today! Anytime you’re\nready will be fine!\c
To be ready to answer any call! To be ready to\naccept any challenge!\c\nThat is the way of a Trainer!\c
How disappointing!
You can make all the preparations in the world,\nbut if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.
I got everything ready so we could have a\nrematch whenever you came.\c
I’m skiing right now, but OK. As we skiers say,\n“Spur thing!”\c
...I’ve hit an ice patch!
I quite enjoyed that battle! Let us meet again.\nSki ya!
We might get snowbound, but why not? It’s on\nthe “spur” of the moment!\c
Are you a novice? Or are you capable?\c
I never expected you to be an expert...
You know how to play your Pokémon with\nan edge!
Knowing you to be an expert, I challenge you to\na rematch!\c
What’s fun about winter? Number one: skiing!\nNumber two: Pokémon!\c
*snivel*
If it was skiing, I wouldn’t lose. I should go ski\nwith my Pokémon...
You’re a better Trainer than a skier. But I’ll\nchallenge you again anyway!\c
How do you expect to battle in this\nheavy snow?\c
The winds of victory shifted...
You even had the cold winds on your side.\c\nI guess you kids are tougher than people my age.
Why would you wander around here? You must\nreally like it here.\c
I can withstand this cold. That means I can take\nany kind of attack!\c
Huh? It’s over, you say?
Oh gosh, this is bad! I think I’m losing feeling all\nover my body!
Oh? I’ve seen your face before. What say\nwe battle?\c
This cold is but nothing compared to the fire that\nburns in my heart!\c
Your heart burns as hot as mine!
The weather clears up sometimes. The view is\nbreathtaking then.
We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze!\c
Wh-what is it? P-Pokémon battle?!\c
Whew... You are alive, aren’t you?
Around these parts, perhaps because of all the\nsnow, there are many folktales of hauntings...
This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve\ntrained since then!\c
I’ll show you the techniques I had drummed into\nme at ski school!\c
I don’t believe it... My techniques were rebuffed...
I should have enrolled in a Pokémon\nTrainers’ school...
Since I lost to you last time, I redid my training at\nski school!\c
We skiers feel Mother Nature through the soles\nof our feet!\c
I got a good taste of your power!
Trainers get an appreciation of life through\nPokémon. At least I think so.
I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with\nthe soles of my feet!\c
I’ve been skiing with Pokémon since I was just\nfive years old.\c
Oh, um, wait... What?!
The scenery doesn’t change very much around\nhere. Don’t go getting lost!
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again? You should\npay more attention!\c
Rainy days make me feel blue...\c\nBut the instant it starts to snow, I’m as happy as\ncan be!\c
The conditions weren’t very good.
Does your Pokétch have that hidden move to\nclimb cliffs?
You really must like snow. After all, if you didn’t,\nI doubt that you’d come here so often!\c
*poof*\c\nYou’ve got a good eye, spotting me!\c
You also saw through my weak spots...
I’ll play with my Pokémon—even in a blizzard!
*poof*\c\nYou saw through my camouflage again!\c
There are several kinds of ninjas. Are you an Iga\nor a Kouga ninja?\c
I’m not much of a ninja either way...
I wonder why everyone stops being a ninja when\nthey grow up?
I forged my willpower in the snow! Witness my\nsnowy might!\c
To make sure I’m more agile, I always dress light!\c
Achoo!
I might have to go home and dress warmer\nthan this...
I’m sticking it out and staying lightly dressed!\c
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting!\c
...
When nothing’s biting, the smart thing to do is\njust call it a day.
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting today either.\c
Outdoor fishing for the win!\c\nShouting doesn’t help my fishing any, but shout\nI must!\c
Gwaaah! This is hurting!
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring away\nthe Pokémon.
Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help!\c
Let it rock! It’s the rhythm of battle!\c
Can you hear it? That’s my guitar, weeping...
I’m too torn up to sing anymore... I am so cool\nthat way...
Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again: our rhythm\nof battle!\c
A man of the sea is also a man of Pokémon!\c
Anchors aweigh!
You’ve got what it takes to be a Trainer\namong Trainers!
Rudder hard to starboard! Hold on!\nNobody go overboard!\c
I love my inner tube. So I admire\njellyfish Pokémon!\c
I’m drifting away...
I wish Professor Rowan would give me a Pokédex.\nBut that old guy looks kind of scary.
I love my inner tube. So I admire\njellyfish Pokémon.\c\nWon’t you hang out with us and just bob around\non the waves?\c
I can’t swim without my floaty. But my Pokémon\nsure can!\c
They weren’t tough, my Pokémon...
My mommy said that Professor Rowan is\nreally kindhearted.
Oh! You’re the Trainer who played with us before!\c\nCan you see if my Pokémon have grown stronger?\c
I only live to swim. Teach me what’s so fun\nabout Pokémon!\c
Wow, that was fun!
I’ll try swimming with Pokémon next.
Yo! You’re that Trainer who taught me how fun\nPokémon can be.\c\nLet’s have another battle, you and me!\c
On your marks... Get set...\c
Owowowow! My leg cramped up!
I forgot to do my stretching exercises...
Hi, I was waiting for you!\nReady? On your marks... Get set...\c
OK! Get your breathing in order! OK! You’re\nready to go!\c
I let my momentum falter...
Listen, I have something important to say to you.\nDon’t drown in your own talent.
OK! You’re ready to go! This time, I’m going for\nthe win!\c
Swimming is a full-body exercise. You should\nswim, too!\c
Sunk like a stone!
Well, Pokémon’s one thing, but you should take\nup swimming, too!
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer! You should be\nswimming like me!\c
The human body floats more easily in the sea, so\nit’s easy to swim!\c
The water’s too salty!
I’ve got that sinking feeling...
Pokémon can stay afloat even while carrying\nsomeone. That’s so cool!\c
I may not look it now, but I’m a star. I’m always\nwith my Pokémon.\c
I lost, but at least I had fun.
If it were an underwater Pokémon show, I would\nhave shined.
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our Pokémon\nshow again?\c
I bought a new bikini! It’s this year’s\nnewest model!\c
Psssssh!
I made a mistake buying this bikini... It’s a little\ntoo tight...
Did I show you already? My bikini, new for\nthis year!\c
Well? Does it look like I’m swimming gracefully?\c
I’m finally feeling fatigued...
I may look like I’m swimming gracefully, but\nbeneath the surface, I’m kicking furiously.
You were attracted by my graceful swimming\nagain, weren’t you?\c
Water-type Pokémon come in a great variety of\nshapes and sizes.\c\nI’ll show you the Water Pokémon that I’ve picked\nfor myself!\c
I can’t boast when I lose... I’m so disappointed...
Sure I lost, but watch me! I’ll get tougher with\nWater Pokémon.
This time, my Water Pokémon will show you why\nI’m so proud of them!\c
Hey. I like fishing. But my true love is battling!\c
*sploosh*
If you don’t know how to fish, you’re missing half\nof life’s enjoyment.\c\nIf you don’t know Pokémon...you’re missing out\non all of it!
Come on—battle me again! You know I love to\nfish and battle!\c
People consider me an Ace Trainer.\c\nLet me demonstrate the skills that earned me\nthat title!\c
I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
I think keeping up the effort to better yourself is\na talent in itself.
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to\nshow you my skill.\c\nThis time, I’ll show you why they consider me\nan ace!\c
Oh? You intend to beat me? I am an ace,\nyou know.\c
I see... I have to concede defeat.
To not be depressed by a loss... That’s one trait\nof an ace.
Ace Trainers always work to improve their\nnatural-born talents.\c
You’re going to Ramanas Park?\c\nIt’s not right that you get to go before a\ncollector like me!\c
You’re one enthusiastic Trainer.
Ramanas Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of\nPokémon you can see there?
Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it\nlike? What was it like?\c
I’m in the middle of fishing, but OK. I’ll be happy\nto sink you.\c
Whooah!
The one that got away was a big one...
Once I hook it, no fish gets away from me!\c\nA Trainer walking by also can’t get free of\nmy clutches!\c
Hi, traveler! How would you like to battle?\c
You sure showed me up.
I like to fish. You’re a traveler.\c\nFarewell, until we meet again!
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve\nbattled before, haven’t we?\c
I’m getting bored of fishing. Let’s have a\nquick battle!\c
I’ve been done in...
Thanks, Trainer. That was a good change of pace.
Yo! I remember how our battle was a good\nchange of pace before.\c\nLet’s have another quick battle!\c
If I stare at the water’s surface for too long, I\nbegin to forget what I was doing in the\r\nfirst place.\c
I don’t know how, but I lost!
Oh, right... I was fishing, wasn’t I?
When I looked up from staring at the water’s\nsurface, I saw your face.\c\nI’m not sure about what I was just doing, but do\nyou want to battle?\c
It takes both brains and brawn when you’re out\nat sea.\c\nAye, it’s not an easy job, the sailor’s life!\c
*glub glub glub*
If you were to become a sailor, I’m sure you’d\nmake a good one!
I’ll beat you this time and convince you to\nbecome a sailor!\c
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me! ♪\c\nThat’s the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪\nYou sing, too!\c
Your Pokémon... They’re looking good!
You ought to think about becoming a\nsailor yourself.\c\nIt’s been great to be able to visit different places\naround the world.
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me! ♪\c\nThat’s the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪\nYou sing, too!\c
Who’s there?! Oh, it’s only a kid. You scared me!\c
I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, so I’m always paying\nclose attention to everything.
I’m no tough guy, and yet here I am on patrol.\nFunny how things go.
I can’t explain why, but I’m more easily agitated\nat night—not that I let it get to me.
Hey, is that you again? You scared me! Again!\nDo you really want to battle that badly?\c
I’m quite bored. Care to break the monotony?\c
The monotony was broken, but at what cost?
I’ll go rest at the hotel. I’ve had quite enough\nof this.
Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break\nthe monotony?\c
After enjoying a meal at the hotel restaurant, one\nhas a battle. That’s the social etiquette.\c
Enchanting.
Personally, I would rather just play with Pokémon\nthan battle with them.
I only seem to run into you after I go to\nthe restaurant.\c\nEtiquette calls for a battle after a meal. Shall we?\c
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon! It’s really cool!\c
Oof! I had to hold on tight to my inner tube!
Pools are OK, but I like the sea because\nPokémon live there.
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon again, right?\nLook, look!\c
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what kind of\nPokémon you have?\c
You’re so tough. I’m stunned...
I want to hang on to a Buizel and just\nbob around.
Listen, listen! Did you find any new kinds\nof Pokémon?\c
I came out here because I wanted to see the\nPokémon League for myself.\c
I’m shocked... No, really, I am.
The way I battle now, well, I can only look at the\nPokémon League!\c\nYou go on! You go to the Pokémon League for\nme, too!
I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the\nPokémon League.\c
I’ve decided! If I can beat you, I’m going to the\nPokémon League!\c
*blblblblugh*
It’s OK. Just let me float away like driftwood...
I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m headed for\nthe Pokémon League!\c
It might not look like it, but I’m traveling now.\c
You’ve got the upper hand on me.
But you can be sure that there will be bigger\nchallenges in front of you.\c\nGo! Go as far as you can! You alone can broaden\nyour horizons.
I’m still on my journey... Let’s have a battle!\c
The sea around here is harsh. It’s made me just\nas harsh!\c
The world is so harsh...
What? You’ve got that many Gym Badges?\nNo wonder you’re so tough...
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have\ntoughened me up more!\c
My dream is to swim in the sea in every region\nunder the sun!\c
Boo! I’m not done with my dream!
I wonder what the seas are like in Kanto\nand Hoenn...
My new dream is to challenge all the Pokémon\nLeagues in every region!\c
Yes, I know I can surf, but I’d rather swim instead.\c\nIt does seem weird—I agree.\c
*kaploosh*
If you don’t know how, I’m willing to show you\nhow to swim.
If you rely on your Pokémon all the time, you’ll\nnever learn how to swim!\c
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too. Don’t think you’re\ngoing to win easily!\c
Master Wake... No, Crasher Wake... I’m so sorry\nto have failed you...
What to do... Train at the Gym again, or train\nby myself...?
I trained at the Gym after you beat me. Let’s do\nit, gang!\c
I’m determined to go to the Pokémon League, no\nmatter how hard it is.\c
Th-this is so hard...
Losing won’t make me give up. The Pokémon\nLeague isn’t going anywhere.
It doesn’t matter how long it takes—I’m going to\nthe Pokémon League!\c
Excuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Was I multitasking too much, battling and\nswimming at the same time?
When I’m in my bikini, I’m at a loss about where\nto carry my Poké Balls!
*giggle*\nExcuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Deep breathing before battle!\c
Inhale... Exhale...
Deep breathing after battle, too!
Don’t get careless, even if you’re facing\nsomeone familiar.\c\nDo your deep-breathing exercises...\c
I found a Trainer who’s floating in the water!
I’ve had my fill...
I’m tired of swimming, so I’ll just float around\nand get some rest.
How much stronger have your Pokémon become?\nLet me check ’em out, OK?\c
Did you know? I was crowned the champion of a\nswimsuit contest!\c\nSo now, I’m trying to win a title at a Super\nContest Show!\c
I’ve been sunk!
I’ll need to rework my strategy!
I became the champion of a swimsuit contest...\nI’m a super-talented girl!\c\nI’m challenging you so I can become the champ\nof a Super Contest Show!\c
My favorite kind of guy is someone that looks\ngood out on the open sea!\c
The tide is going out...
...Though there’s a mysterious nature that\nsurrounds a mountain man...
Hello again! You’re that Trainer who looks keen\nwith their Pokémon!\c
Fine, all righty then. Just a quick battle on\nmy break!\c
Wahaha! Mercy! I cry mercy!
I’d better get on back to work...\c\nYou know, I’d rather be traveling around with\nPokémon the way you do.
I’m gonna let you in on a secret... I snuck my\nPokémon to work!\c
Well, now aren’t you something!
OK, OK, time for work! I’ll work up a thirst with\nmy Pokémon!
What’s cool, you might ask? No? I’ll tell you\nanyway: bug Pokémon!\c
It bugs me when people ignore the awesome\ncoolness of bug Pokémon!
It would seem that coolness alone doesn’t add\nup to any wins...
Here comes the swarm!\c
Whoooh...
Did you know? “Swarm” is the name of a\nPokémon Ability.
My senses tingle... I’ve spotted a rare Pokémon!\c
Awawawawah...
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but it turned out\nto be just a Trainer!
We’re just out on a power walk!\c
Oh, you!
Ewww, nasty! This forest is full of bug Pokémon...\c\nI also forgot to buy some Antidotes. It’s just the\nworst thing ever!
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond as one, a\nwondrous power is born...\c
Hmm...
There still remain many mysteries yet to be\nsolved in this strange world...
A strange presence has been felt... It is\nemanating from...you!\c
Oh! Be one with me, my Meditite!
The Old Chateau... I sense...a particularly strong\npresence there.
I see it... I see it...\c\nI see you going down in defeat...\c
It is I that have gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...lies abandoned, with none\nliving in its walls...\c\nAnd yet, and yet, there permeates a presence...
This forest is strange, you know... It seems to fill\nme with energy...\c
Your victory... There is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem to gather such\nunexplainable energy.
You... One look at you tells me you’re a\nreal contender!\c
You’re as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other side of the\nroad when I walk by ’em.\c\nIt’s a goal of mine I’m working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as if my journey\nis now coming to an end.\c\nBut before the final chapter is written, I must\npen your defeat!\c
That wasn’t how I planned the final chapter to go\nin my writing class...
If you don’t give up, you can reach your goal.\c\nThat perseverance is what’s important to Trainers.\nThat’s in my book, too.
Show me how you’ve battled to get here!\nLet’s do this!\c
So, that’s how you battled...?
Once you emerge from Victory Road, the\nPokémon League lies directly ahead...\c\nBut many Trainers fail to ever find their way on\nVictory Road...
This total stranger’ll be a good way to see if I\nhave what it takes to own the Pokémon League’s\r\nElite Four!\c
That battle just now must make you tougher than\neveryone in the world.
It doesn’t appear as if anyone could even try to\nstand against your might.\c\nThe Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have a lot of trust\nin you.\c\nYou and your Pokémon... You seem to be aglow.\c
Ah, I understand it now!
You blaze with so much vitality!
Let me take a measure of how much you have\nraised your Pokémon!\c
Brilliant!
Rather than navigating Victory Road, I have a\nmuch better time putting young Trainers like you\r\nto the test.
I’m making an already-strong Pokémon grow\neven stronger. I’ll need your help with this!\c
There’s no way I could have won!
Now how am I gonna teach it the most powerful\nDragon-type moves...? Well?
Top-level Trainers gather around this\nplace naturally.\c\nI’d go so far as to call it the ideal place to train\nwith the best!\c
That’s why I like it here; I get to battle tough\ncharacters like you.
When two roads diverge, you must choose the\npath less traveled...
My Pokémon knows karate! I’m warning you.\nIt’s a tough one!\c
I’ve met my match in strength!
I’ve made it this far in life using the karate I\nlearned on the internet!
I keep battling so I can soar ever higher into\nthe skies!\c
It seems I’ve been grounded...
The wings of freedom...\c\nI know I’ll find them if I can win my way through\nthe Pokémon League...
Be warned, mortal! I can see the future!\c
So be it! I will now divulge what I know of your\nfuture... Hmm!
In the Pokémon League ahead, the Elite Four\nawait you!\c\nBut you knew that already.
I can see the past!\c
There’s just so much in your past...
Did you... Did you meet a Legendary Pokémon?\c\nNo. That can’t be right...
It’s a double team of aces! We’re gonna\noverwhelm you!\c
You and your Pokémon will gain power by\nhelping each other out.
The combination of you and your awesome\nPokémon... It’s the ultimate tag team!
If you don’t mind, we’re hoping for some\ntwo-on-two battle action.
We form a combination that’s in perfect sync!\nHow do you expect to counter that?\c
You and your Pokémon make a\nbeautiful combination!
Yup, the way you battle is fantastic!\c\nYou should try to take on the Elite Four right\nnow—not later!
We want to have a battle without an advantage.\c\nPlease come back when you have at least\ntwo Pokémon!
I intend to perfect my Double Battle technique.\nThat will make me better all around.\c
You! You’re an expert Double Battler, too!
Your mastery over several Pokémon at once...\nYou’re a remarkable Trainer!
You have but one Pokémon?\c\nI would say that you are taking Victory Road too\nlightly, kid.
I want to improve my technique as a Trainer,\nand as a Double Battler, as much as I can.\c
My goodness! You’re great at Double Battles!
Depending on the combinations, every kind of\nPokémon can excel. At least, that’s what I think.
You’re really going through Victory Road with\nonly one Pokémon?
We Trainers will accept challenges anywhere!\nIt’s what we do.\c
Hmm... Insufficiently raised?
Gee... When you’re in a cave, wild Pokémon can\nappear anytime!
To celebrate my getting through this cave, I’m\ngoing to battle you!\c
Well, I guess losing is something to\ncommemorate, too...
Getting through this cave feels like an adventure.
I’m a Veteran, yes, but don’t you dare treat me\nlike a senior citizen!\c
Hnuuurgh... So much skill for one so young!
I’ll always remain young at heart. Never let them\nsay you’re too old!
Oh, what’s this? My last one! This is where we\nmake our stand!\c
We’re not done yet! There’s no giving up!
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
Aiyaah! We’re coming out swinging with\nsuper-heavy judo chops!\c
That was...a complete trashing!
I must rededicate myself to training. The road\nextends into infinity...
Up and down you go on the lifts. Me?\nI like to battle!\c
You’ve got me feeling down!
I can’t keep this up! I’ll go back to working on\nthe lifts.
A Pokémon Gym isn’t only about seeing how\ntough your Pokémon happen to be.\c\nIt’s so much deeper than just that. It’s a test of\nyou as a person.\c
That move was devastating!
I get to work all day with my Pokémon—and even\nbattle sometimes.\c\nI get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and experience of\nbattling at high levels.\c\nI’ll demonstrate what that means to a noob\nlike you!\c
Wow... I’m in the mood to sing a lullaby...
Your earnest enthusiasm... I guess that kinda\nmakes you an ace.\c\nMaybe you’re a Trainer who has the potential to\nsurpass aces!
By focusing on only one type, you can really see\nthe strengths and weaknesses of that Pokémon.\c
My focus was too narrow-minded...
Start by learning to truly appreciate\nyour Pokémon.\c\nIf you do that, you’ll learn naturally how you\nshould battle with it.
Steel represents an unbending spirit!\c\nIf you never give up, the path to victory\nreveals itself!\c
I never gave up, but still I failed to win...
If you give up, well, that’s when everything ends\nfor you!
Pokémon and people have worked together for\nmany years.\c\nLet us show you an example of that history!\c
A spectacular loss! But it’s still a loss!
The way you helped each other... That is what\nmade you prevail!
What do you think you’re doing to my Pokémon?!
This can’t be! I lost?! You...you annoying brat!
I ain’t fooling around, kid. This is how a\nprofessional does it!\c
You messed up my job... Now I’m not gonna get\na bonus...
I hear they’re going to do something with\nelectricity, I think.
Collecting electricity from the Valley\nWindworks... That’s our mission.\c
I really don’t like kids who also happen to be\ntough Trainers...
You don’t have an inkling of what Team Galactic\nis trying to achieve!\c\nOf course, they don’t tell a grunt like me\nanything, either... But still!
This is why I’m gonna be stuck as a\ngrunt forever...
If only I had some decent Pokémon...
Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
We were having a heated discussion over\nPokémon the way collectors do.\c
Knowledge alone isn’t everything, you know...
I’m more knowledgeable than the rest when it\ncomes to collecting. I have rare Pokémon!\c\nBut a collector doesn’t make a good\nbattler, necessarily...
I’m a collector, and I’m proud of what I know\nabout Pokémon.\c\nWould you like me to test your knowledge?\c
That’s some knowledge you have there!
I don’t like people who are more knowledgeable\nthan me! Go away!
Welcome! This Pokémon is my pride and joy!\c
I take losses with an unusually big smile! Do you\nfind that odd at all?
After a match, you should have some Moomoo\nMilk to quench your thirst!\c\nJust chug it right down!\n*glug glug*
It’s not the end yet.
Are you saying something? You think you have\nme cornered?
Amazing! You’re very good, aren’t you?
*giggle*\nYou found me! Of course I’ll battle you!\c
Aww, boo! Look—you’ve beaten me!
*giggle*\nThere’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on—\r\ndon’t be afraid!
A forest inside a Gym... Shocking, isn’t it?\c
I was going to beat you while you were still in a\nstate of shock...
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past\ntwo boulders.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some\nserious special attacks.\c\nI won’t let you win easily!\c
The more beautiful a flower, the faster\nit withers...
Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer...\c\nIn the middle of three trees. That’s it for my hint.\nGood luck!
Even concealed, there is no hiding the aroma\nof flowers.\c
Just like your inability to conceal your\nabundant skill.
Your next opponent is under four flowers.
Hey! That there! That was a good move!
This is where it gets exciting!
Hunwah! It’s gone and ended!\c\nHow will I say this... I want more! I wanted to\nbattle a lot more!
I’ve landed the most fish Pokémon in the world.\nI’m next!\c
Being number one in the world doesn’t mean\na thing...
I figure I got too wrapped up in fishing and\nneglected training.
I have mastery over the incredible power of\nwater. You won’t win!\c
But the kid wins anyway! I’m just bowled over!
The water rising and falling is tricky, but don’t let\nit annoy you.\c\nIf you lose sight of yourself, that’s when you’re\nset to lose.
I’ve traveled all over the globe while\nraising Pokémon.\c\nThis is the Gym I’ve chosen. You’ll find it a\nhandful for sure!\c
You! You’re a kind of top-class tough!
If you were to go around the world, I’m sure\nyou’d meet tougher Pokémon.
Like the raging sea, I crash down and wash away\neverything before me! That’s just how I roll!\c
That wave didn’t even wash my hands...
I’m now becalmed like a waveless sea...
My body isn’t the only thing I work on\ntoughening up here.\c\nI also work on my Pokémon and my spirit!\c
Wow, Trainer! You just might be tougher than our\nGym Leader!
Maybe I’ll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher\nWake—and wear the same kind of mask.
I want to become a strong Trainer like\nCrasher Wake!\c
*groan*\nYou’re too much.
Maybe I’ll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher\nWake—and use the same kinds of Pokémon.
Oh! But this isn’t the end, my friend!
I’m in a bit of a bind, aren’t I?
I shall admit defeat... You are much too strong.
We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for love with my fist!\nHiyah, looooooooove!\c
Argh! Crunched!
Your Pokémon sure are tough!\c\nBut our Gym Leader Maylene will break you like\na stack of bricks!
We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for courage with my fist!\nHiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!\c
I couldn’t force my way to victory...
To overwhelm by force... That is my ideal\nbeatdown style.\c\nIt doesn’t seem to work that way with\nPokémon, however.
We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for hope with my fist!\nHiyah, hoooooooooooooope!\c
We came up short but not by much.
I’ll have to redo my training, though.\nMaylene’s gonna trample me again...
We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for tears with my fist!\nHiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!\c
I’m so hungry, kid... I don’t have any\nstrength left...
I lost because I didn’t eat enough pizza.\c\nNo. Anything I say will sound like I’m\nmaking excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this? Is this my\nfinal Pokémon?
Never give up—no matter what!
You are so fantastically strong. I know now why I\nhave lost.
I’ve been to all sorts of places. That means I\nknow tons of things!\c
Yeah, whatever. You can battle, too...
I’m gonna visit new places and find new Pokémon\nso I’ll be a know-it-all!
Seriously, kid, why don’t you answer the quiz\nproperly? You could get to the Gym Leader\r\nwithout a problem! Waste of my time.\r\nNow I gotta knock you around a bit.\c
I kinda deserved that, didn’t I? I gotta stop\nmouthing off like that...
I’ll remember you and your shifty Pokémon, too.\nI’m watching you...
Ooh, ooh! You want to battle me? OK then,\nI’ll do the best I can!\c
I squeezed out all my power... You’re one\nimpressive challenger.
Look at it this way: you can learn something from\nevery battle.
Ehehe! You threw the quiz so you’d get to battle\nwith me, right?\c
Don’t you know how to take it easy or\nanything? Geesh!
Since you’re here, you might as well take on\nevery Trainer.
I’m not afraid of picnicking anywhere, so I’ve\nlearned all sorts of things.\c
Your toughness... It’s something new to me.
I’ve learned that Pokémon are fun ’cause\neveryone plays with ’em!
I study subjects like Pokémon and history...\nYou know, all the important things!\c
Oh, what in the—? I didn’t study enough?
You won because of Pokémon type matchups,\ncool tactics...\c\nYou know, all sorts of reasons!
I’ve probably studied more about Pokémon\nthan you.\c
Oh, you! I feel bad that I’m so angry!
I’m going over the reasons why I lost. That way,\nI’ll win next time.
Don’t you have a Pokétch? Or did you\nscrew up deliberately?\c
Gwaaah! I was done in!
You’ll have to turn back, though. This is a\ndead end.
I’m going to break the ice and bring out my\nlast-resort Pokémon!
I can sense your will to win, but I promise you I’m\nnot about to lose!
I must say, I’ve warmed up to you! I might even\nadmire you a little.
It’s t-too cold. I can’t even feel my t-tongue.\c
This result... It’s cold. Bitter cold.
The higher up you slide from, the more speed\nyou’ll have to smash those big snowballs.
My willpower was shaped and tempered by\nhowling blizzards. I’ll bring it to bear on you!\c
You weren’t even fazed...
I’ve battled countless Trainers and many more\nPokémon still.\c\nMy spirit has been hardened from all the battles\nI have fared.
Is the Gym’s trick floor making you a little hot\nunder the collar?\c\nIf you can’t maintain your cool in battle, you’ll\nfreeze up.\c
You were surprisingly cool... At least I have my\nwarm boots.
Your Pokémon [VAR 1301(tagParameter=253,tagWordArray=gets|get)] so caught up in the heat of\nbattle. [VAR 1301(tagParameter=253,tagWordArray=It burns|They burn)] so hot, [VAR 1301(tagParameter=253,tagWordArray=it's|they're)] cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling the chill of fatigue?\c\nA good Trainer goes for the win no matter what\ntheir condition is!\c
That’s right. A good Trainer will win, no matter\nwhat the situation may be.
The Trainer’s feelings... The Pokémon’s feelings...\c\nIf they are one and the same, you will never lose.
Here it comes! Get ready for my trump card!
Shocking... I didn’t see this coming!
You’ve got me beat. Your desire and the noble\nway your Pokémon battled for you...\c\nI even felt thrilled during our match. That was a\nvery good battle.
Wow! I’m surprised you’ve come this far,\nbut you’ll have to turn back.\c\nThere isn’t any chance that you could ever\nbeat me!\c
What makes your Pokémon so special?
As a challenger, you’re one tough Trainer.
I’m not just looking for tough Trainers to battle.\nI’ve been battling here because I want to feel\r\nthe rush!\c
Your power is so shocking, it’s made me\ngo numb.
I’m so glad there are Pokémon! There isn’t much\nelse that gives me the thrill that Pokémon do!
I want to win! I channel that desire through\nmy guitar!\c\nI want to win! That desire makes my Pokémon\na star!\c
We couldn’t win... No encores for us...
The Trainer’s desire to win! If you don’t lose that,\nthere’s no limit on what you can become!
Spark!\c\nThis is what our Gym Leader did to the Gym out\nof boredom!\c
Spark...
We were lacking energy...\c\nNo, we lacked more than that. We didn’t want\nthe win enough.
Whether you’re a Trainer or a guitarist, it takes\ndedication to improve your mad skills!\c
My skills seem to have let me down. I must have\nbeen out of tune!
The way you battle, I can feel the very heart of\nrock and roll.\c\nTell me—are you maybe a fan of rocking out?
Look at the way I’m dressed. Can’t you see that\nI’m hard-core?\c
I was being serious! Don’t laugh at me! I mean it!
I dress this way so I can learn to think like an\nElectric-type Pokémon.\c\nWhy don’t you give it a try?
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.\c\nThat’s why I’m here—to learn the best battle\ntechniques around!\c
You’re tough.
You just showed me that there’s still lots I need\nto learn. The world of Pokémon is deep!
Can you make it to the Gym Leader?\nYou sure now?\c
The gears spin round and round... I spin down\nand out...
Our Gym’s trick walkways are sure to make your\nhead spin!
My dragon Pokémon chose to become powerful\nhere. They sure like it!\c
Your battle style...
It’s been several years since I left the\nDragon’s Den.\c\nI’ve got to say, your Pokémon [VAR 1301(tagParameter=253,tagWordArray=is|are)] in the top class\nfor toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to\nbecome powerful.\c
There’s something about you... You’re not just\nanybody. I challenge you!\c
You’re at a different level of expertise, for sure!
You’ve won countless times... That has made you\nvery powerful.
There’s something about you... You still remain\nextraordinary. I challenge you again!\c
I constantly analyze Pokémon and various battles\non my laptop.\c
Things don’t always work out according to\nmy calculations...
I had a lot of fun battling with you, though.\c\nI wonder if I can analyze the battle\ndata properly.\c\nI could use a rematch to get some\nadditional data.
I analyzed our last battle on my laptop.\c
For some reason I was drawn here, and it is here\nthat I met you...\c\nI want to know what all this means!\c
I see... So that’s what it means...
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic\npresence emanating from here...
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to\nknow what all this means!\c
There is nothing here... And yet there is a\npower lurking...\c\nWere you drawn by it as well?\c
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather\nmarvelous indeed...
A place where nothing else exists...\c\nA place such as that is better suited to awaken\nthe power within.
See? You’ve come back again.\c\nThere must be something that draws you here...\c
I don’t care who you are—no one interferes with\nmy treasure hunting!\c
My treasure! My Pokémon!
I heard there’s an intriguing stone monument\naround, so I came running.
I’m still here...and still searching for treasures.\c\nHowever, a battle with you is a treasure I can’t\npass up!\c
A man standing alone, I face the sea and train.\nThese fists were hewn in that way!\c
My training and my fists weren’t enough to\ndefeat you!
Argh! Instead of training myself, I should have\ntrained my Pokémon!\c\nAll I’ve been doing for the last year is staring out\nover the sea!
Ah, it’s been a long time!\c\nI have been toughening my fists against the sea,\njust as before!\c
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more\nPokémon! So, what kind of a Trainer are you?\c
I see... Simply outstanding.
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more\nPokémon. You’re a strong Trainer. Moreover,\r\nyour heart is strong.
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an\nexcuse to slack off.\c\nI take pride in challenging those who have\nbested me before!\c
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me!\c
Ouch! Are you one of those crazy fans? You sure\nare rowdy!
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for\nbeing such a fan!\c\nJust so you know, our latest single is called\n“Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! We just might\nhave a scoop here!\c
My camera’s too heavy. I couldn’t\nbattle effectively...
The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon’s faces make for some great TV!
Your spirit’s giving off some seriously cool vibes...\nI can tell that you totally rock!\c
You beat me, but...I feel totally amped to\njam harder!
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit,\ntoo! That’s why battles rock! Rawk!
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK?\c
The camera is our witness! It’s recorded\nour defeat...
I’d like to take that footage and have it\nbroadcast worldwide.
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d get\na great shot here.
So, let’s begin and find out what sort of a Trainer\nyou are!\c
You have a superstar quality! You sure could\nbecome a celebrity!
I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We just made some\ngreat TV!
Oh, no. What we really want to see is you in\naction with two Pokémon!
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am!\nAren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun!\r\nOK?! Mwahahah!\c
Oh, no, no, no! Mwahahah?
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while\nlaughing. It defines what we do!
Po! Po! Pokémon!\c\nHeh, did you think I was a real Pokémon?\c
Pikachu!
I need to get more into the character of\na Pokémon...
Join me in this on-the-spot report, live at the\nscene of a battle!\c
The media is the victim!
Interviews are about taking the initiative.
How is this madness possible? The two of us,\nlosing to children?
This won’t do... Time to retreat. This mission is\na failure.
How insolent. Take a bite of this, child!
Losing to some child... Being careless cost me\ntoo much.
We are gathering Pokémon for an astonishing\nundertaking! Your meddling won’t be tolerated!\c
I feel like I got meddled with...
Our astonishing undertaking is most certainly\nbreathtaking. If you ever hope to see its glorious\r\nunveiling, then don’t meddle with us!
Our objectives are incredible—too incredible for\nme to understand!\c\nI’ll fight blindly to defend them, and your\nintrusion won’t be forgiven!\c
What was I fighting for again?
What do you have against taking Pokémon from\nothers? Look in any field or forest! Those things\r\naren’t exactly rare!
Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn’t accept\nchildren as members!\c
B-but, deary, you’re just a kid!
You wanted to go up? Well, why didn’t you?
Let’s see how good this Pokémon is! I stole it\nfrom some weak Trainer.\c
What is this?!
Wimpy little Pokémon...\c\nWhen I get promoted, I’ll demand better\nstolen Pokémon.
Why, thank you!\c\nWe love it when people come to us to donate\ntheir Pokémon!\c
What do you think you’re doing?!
You can catch Pokémon anywhere. What’s so\nspecial about them?\c\nTrainers that lose theirs should quit whining and\ncatch some more!
This place is teeming with Unown... There has to\nbe some meaning to this.\c\nThe truth can be found. I’ll start my search by\nbattling you!\c
The search must continue!
I give up. I’m not going to rack my brain over the\nmeaning of this place.
I can’t explain it... Being here compels me\nto battle!\c
Hunh?! What was I just doing?!
Though they are gone, their desire to battle lives\non? The spirits of Pokémon still linger?\c\nIs that what it is?
I need to shake off my sorrow... Please, battle\nwith me!\c
My sorrow has deepened...
I won’t ever forget the time I spent with my\nPokémon...not even for a moment.
It makes no difference where we are. If you have\nPokémon with you, I reckon you ought to battle.\c
You’ve got a lot of giddyup and go in you!
Over a long life, you’ll be certain to have some\nsad farewells. But I reckon there are also some\r\nnew beginnings.
Hahaha! I’m afraid y’all are no match for us with\njus’ one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one. Lemme show you!\c
Well! Aren’t you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower... And right’n\nhere, inside my heart... Those are the places\r\nwhere my Pokémon remain...
You haven’t got yerself two Pokémon?
My Pokémon were taken from me...\nTeam Galactic did it...\c\nEver since, I’ve never forgiven their faces...\c
Gwaaaaaah!
I’m not doing my Pokémon any favors by ruining\nits memory like this...\c\nI can’t be wallowing around forever. I gotta move\non and turn the page.
I can’t embarrass myself again. Not in front of\nmy girlfriend!\c
Awww, jeez. That’s a downer...
Coming here again brings back all kinds of\nmemories of me and Nat.
You can’t battle with us. Not with one\nPokémon, anyway.
I don’t want to look bad again. Not when my\nboyfriend is watching!\c
This makes me feel hollow inside...\nOh so hollow...
The Pokémon that brought me and Mike\ntogether is buried here...
You do have at least two Pokémon, don’t you?
Waaah! Ghost! Get away! Eek! Help me, team!\c
Hey... You’re no ghost...
I had to come here because I lost a dare with\nsome kids at school.\c\nThe loser had to go to the top and bring back\nthe TM for Strength.
Beating you would be my hundredth straight win!\nHere’s to a fun battle!\c
You don’t know how frustrating it is to lose now,\nafter all that work!
I wish I could beat Maylene in Veilstone City\none day...
Yeah, I like to camp! So what? Let’s battle!\c
I should’ve just stuck to camping out here...
When I’m with my Pokémon, I can camp just\nabout anywhere I want!
If we battle here, your Pokémon will become\nstronger, and so will mine.\c\nThat’s a good thing for both of us. What’s not to\nlike? Let’s throw down!\c
You know, I would have really enjoyed a win\nthere. Would’ve been real nice.
This mine’s been abandoned, but now it’s home\nto many Pokémon. I guess everything finds a\r\nplace to call home someday...
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...\c\nYou tell me—where else can I find a place as\ngood as this to train?\c
That was good. You’ve bonded well with\nyour Pokémon.
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...\c\nA strong spirit and a tight bond... There is so\nmuch to train for.
I’ll pound the fear of my fists into you all karate\nstyle, punk!\c
I’m so sorry... I got a bit mouthy there, didn’t I?
So, I’m gonna try and shatter steel!\c\nI wonder how many more years it would take for\nme to do that?
Every good hiker gets a boost of energy when\nsurrounded by boulders!\c\nWrooooar! Coming at you! Let me blow off\nsome steam!\c
Whew... I think I’ve calmed down now...
If it’s called a mountain, you can be sure I’ll be\nclimbing it.\c\nEven if it’s a mountain of food, I’ll still be stickin’\nmy flag on top!
When you’re up in the mountains, a battle’d do\nfor a proper greeting!\c
Yahoo!
Actually, when you’re up in the mountains,\na simple hi’d do if you walk past someone.\c\nOh, and this isn’t the mountains.
May we have a battle, please?\c\nIt will be something to lighten up this boring\npicnic with.\c
We’re not going to win if we play around\nlike that...
I’m going home to play with my Pokémon!
The working-class hero says hi!\c
The working-class hero waves bye...
I used to work here a long time ago, before it\nshut down. I worked at the ironworks near\r\nFloaroma Town, too.\c\nYou might say I’m drawn to iron as if by magnet!
While I’m making sure the lifts are safe, I’ll focus\non a battle with you!\c
A-OK! Looks safe to me! Not a problem in sight!
I routinely check the lifts here. You can be sure\nof their safety!
Hey! This is no playground! If you’re gonna play,\nbattle me!\c
You played me like an amateur!
They were going to close this place up so no one\ncould get in. But they left it open so people and\r\nPokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place as their\ntraining grounds.\c
Maybe I should head to the Gym and work\nout there...
Roark spent his childhood playing here, I think...
Humph! You’re lost, aren’t you? I’ll guide you if\nyou can beat me.\c
I said I’m going to win!
I’m not lost, I tell you! I’m camping!\nThat’s my story!
Huh? Are you lost, too? No? It doesn’t matter.\nLet’s have a quick Pokémon battle!\c
Not fair! We’re not on the same level!
I got separated from my friends... I’ve got my\nPokémon with me, so I’m OK, but...
You look like you might just have the Pokémon\nI’ve been looking for!\c
You didn’t have a single Pokémon I wanted...\nYou’re no collector!
I’m very picky, so I want to collect every\nPokémon without anyone’s help.\c\n...I do have friends, though. No, seriously! I do!
In deep tunnels and caves, there’re a couple\nthings you’re sure to see.\c\nZubat and Ruin Maniacs!\c
Your awesome power... It’s mystifying.
I’ve scoured every inch of this place... Most of it\nwhile I was lost.\c\nAnyway, if there’s one thing I can say, this place\ncan’t be called ruins!
Hush now, lost little Pokémon. Don’t you cry.\nI’m here to take care of you!\c
*sniffle*\nWh-who’s crying now?
Speaking of crying, I’m positive I heard crying\nfrom deeper in the cave.
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!\c
I strayed from the battle plan!
Me? No, I’m not lost. I live here!
Wandering around, I got hungry, so I ate some\nwild mushrooms... They gave me gas, and now\r\nI can’t stop burping! Bluurrf!\c
Bleff! Hurk! I think...I’m getting better...
I hear there’s a Pokémon that has mushrooms\ngrowing on its back.\c\nNot around here—somewhere far away. I wonder\nif the mushrooms taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?\nAre you a Pokémon Trainer?\c
OK, so we’re both Trainers. That’s a start, right?
I just wanted to have a picnic under\nCycling Road. I didn’t think I would get lost\r\nin a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a cute setting,\ngood food, and a fun battle!\c
That wasn’t any fun for me!
Why have a picnic here? I don’t know.\nThere’s no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too? Wanna play battle\nwith me?\c
You were just toying with me!
I’m playing hide-and-seek here. I like some\nunderground tag, too.
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon will see\nthrough your weaknesses!\c
Don’t you have an Achilles’ heel?
I want to become stronger but only with my\nfavorite Pokémon.
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon is the\nshortcut to getting tough.\c
I lost? But how is that possible?!
Being able to manage any kind of Pokémon...\nI suppose that makes a good Trainer.
Being this tough isn’t good enough. You have to\nlook cool while doing it.\c\nMastering that makes you an ace!\c
Made me look bad...
I battled the best I could. I wasn’t uncool in\nlosing! ...Right?
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of the\nsweetness that is victory.\c\nI can’t afford to lose this one!\c
This defeat has the tang of my bitter tears...
I feel sorry for my hungry Pokémon...\c\nSorry, team. I’ll get tougher so you can feast on\nthe taste of victory...
I will win. I am sure of it. Therefore, you will lose!\c
But... This isn’t possible!
You didn’t win! I just lost! Oh, whatever. It’s the\nsame thing...
Let me see what you got there, kid. I could give\nyou some advice.\c
You got way too much!
Well, I don’t have any advice for someone as\ntough as you!
Now we shall have a battle, and from it will\nemerge one loser...\c
Oh!
I can use psychic powers, but battling isn’t so\nsimple... It takes much more to win!
A battle is a clash of willpower!\c\nThe one who wants the win the most will emerge\nthe victor!\c
But...I thought I could win!
Psychic power...\c\nIt’s hard to put faith in something that you\ncan’t see...
Allow me to demonstrate how a true psychic\nconducts a battle!\c
Did I get to show you anything? Anything at all?
How do I use my psychic powers?\c\nI never use them for dishonest ends. I also never\ndo any good deeds...
I see it! I see a victory for me!\c
The future...is different! Why?!
Your efforts have altered the very path of\nthe future!
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon at the\nFighting Dojo in Kanto!\c
Totally done for!
We’re gonna go ahead and leave... You know,\ngo train elsewhere.
Judo chop! Pokémon battle!\c
Wrroar! Judo chop defeated!
I’ll forget that we lost!\c\nWait—if I did that, we’d never learn from\nour mistakes...
What it means to battle... Its joys, its sorrows...\nI’ve experienced it all!\c
My sorrow deepens...
You may be a child, but you’ve taught me a\nwhole lot. I thank you humbly.
I’ll wheel out some wicked Pokémon and even\nwickeder moves!\c
All I can manage now is to wheeze out a few\nmeek sighs...
I don’t see what my age has to do with playing\nwith Pokémon, frankly.
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to wherever.\nAnd so, here I am!\c
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out\nto be the Battle Zone...
I was born in the Hoenn region. I’ve only just\nrecently flown here.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,\nwe train here daily!\c
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of Mother\nNature. They’re tough!\c
How could you be tougher than Mother Nature?
Most of the time, my Pokémon return to their\nPoké Balls right away.\c\nBut sometimes, they just fall asleep on top of my\nhead. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be evident in\nevery Trainer!\c
The potential of dragon Pokémon puts them at\nthe top of my list!\c
Potential doesn’t mean I can win...
A Dragon Tamer Champion... I’ll need to train so\nmuch more to even come close to coming close...
I cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s potential!\nI’ve been looking forward to seeing you again!\c
What my Pokémon and I most want: victory!\c
Arrrgh! My Gyarados...
I don’t ever want to put my Pokémon through\nthat again...\c\nIt got humiliated because I wasn’t good enough...
You’ve beaten us before, but we won’t make the\nsame mistake!\c
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings... That’s what\nmy master taught me.\c\nAnd now I’ll prove it to you!\c
Not good enough! We’re still not strong enough!
It’s not good enough for a Pokémon to just be\ntough. It’s not good enough for a Trainer to just\r\nwork hard. Both have to grow together!
This time, I’ll show you how brilliantly I work with\nmy Pokémon partner!\c
How do you do? I’m a Dragon Tamer. What say\nwe compare our Pokémon by means of a battle?\c
Oops! How very silly of me!
Well, there seems to be an image associated\nwith Dragon Tamers. But personally, I’m really\r\nlaid back and easygoing, you know?\c\nI figure there’s a whole lot of other things I need\nto worry about first.
Heya, how do you do again? What say we let our\nPokémon duke it out in another battle?\c
There is something missing in the way I battle...\nI’ve come here to find it.\c
I see it now... I know what I lack.
It’s been a privilege to have battled with you.\nI learned an invaluable lesson from you today.
I’ve discovered what’s missing from my battles—\nHave you discovered what’s missing from yours?\c
I’ve got the urge to battle with you. I hope\nyou’re willing to oblige!\c
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge...
So long as my partner’s alongside me, I’m willing\nto take on the world!
The urge to battle you again has struck me.\nWant to humor me?\c
Have you any knowledge of levels or the stats of\nPokémon? Well, I do!\c
Hmm. I like how you attack.
Pokémon levels and stats... Who cares about\nthat stuff?\c\nWinning is what’s important.\nNumbers aren’t everything.
Pokémon battles aren’t decided by numbers.\c\nThe decisive factor is the bond you share with\nyour Pokémon!\c
Welcome to my Pokémon show!\c
Did you enjoy the show? Super fabulous,\nwasn’t it?
I’ll be happy to battle you again! Let’s battle\nagain sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show!\c
My team’s been trained through and through!\nYou’ll shake when you see how tough they are!\c
I’m sh-sh-shaking all over...
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos... You name it,\nI pumped ’em full of it.
Hey, you’re that Trainer who left me all shook up!\nUh-huh!\c\nThis time, it’s my turn to leave you shaking\nall over!\c
My partner and I have come this far. Let me show\nyou how much it’s grown!\c
It needs to grow more?!
My Pokémon... It’s actually the very first friend\nthat I’ve ever had.
When I close my eyes, I’m taken back to that\ntime we lost to you.\c\nMy partner’s grown even more since then.\nI’ll prove it to you!\c
Worthy opponents... The search for them drives\nme to travel far.\c
I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you...
How much you believe in your Pokémon—\nthat’s a critical factor in how a battle will\r\nturn out.
We’ve faced many challengers since we met,\nbut they were all weak...\c\nI relish the tough resistance that only you\ncan provide!\c
Please don’t hold anything back.\c
Hmm...
I feel invigorated from that battle, even though\nwe lost. After all, we gave it everything we had.
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back—\njust like before.\c
You’re willing to battle? Let me see what kind of\nPokémon you have.\c
Your love of Pokémon really shows!
I grew up together with my team, right from\nmy childhood.\c\nAll our memories, we’ve always shared them.
Oh, hi, we meet again. May I see what you’ve\ndone with your Pokémon?\c
The world is huge, and there are so many\ndifferent Pokémon!\c\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you? Please,\nI want to have a look!\c
Wow, there really are Pokémon that wonderful!
There is always something to like about\nany Pokémon.\c\nIt’s so hard to decide which ones I should raise.
If I’m having trouble deciding, I go with\nmy favorites!\c
What sort of moves have you taught? That tells\nme how good you are!\c
Yowch!
I heard that somewhere, there’s someone who\nteaches Pokémon moves.
Have you taught your team any new moves since\nlast time?\c
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts!\c
You won’t let me win?
I suddenly remembered what it was like when I\nhad my first battle. I wonder why that would be?
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts!\nThat’s what makes us Trainers!\c
You’re going to win! That’s the future I saw!\c
What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
I lost, but my vision of the future came true...
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw!\c
Right after this, you will send out Pokémon to\nbattle me!\c
Right after this, I have to pay out your\nprize money...
What will happen to you after this? Why don’t\nyou do just as you like? It would be more fun\r\nthat way.
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an\nastonishingly cool way!\c
My quest for power brought me here. It was\nbeneath the desert sand that I toughened\r\nmy body and soul.\c\nAccept my challenge! Uraah!\c
My spirit is broken...
I thought I couldn’t win before it became a fact...\c\nI’ve let down my Pokémon... They go to battle\nwith faith in their Trainer...
This time—this time I will win! My spirit is\nrenewed and strong!\c
I have meditated under a waterfall to temper my\nspirit. Allow me to demonstrate its strength!\c
Ha-choo! *sniffle*
All that time under the waterfall... Seems I’ve\ncaught a cold.
Since the day I lost to you, I’ve meditated under\na waterfall!\c
People! Nature! Pokémon! Harmony is essential!\c
You’re A-OK!
Protecting Pokémon and nature. Think of what\nthat means.
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\c\nThat’s right. Harmony is essential!\c
I work to protect beautiful, natural environments.\c\nMy Pokémon are my constant companions while\nI work.\c
Oh my gosh! My poor Pokémon!
Everyone can do their part to keep nature clean.\nIt doesn’t take much.
I’m on patrol in pristine nature with my Pokémon\nlike usual.\c\nCome to think of it, you’re always with\nPokémon, too.\c
We go on patrol to make sure there’s nothing\nstrange going on. And occasionally, we battle!\c
Thanks much!
You know that Pokémon Ability, Pickup? I think\nthat’s a good way of keeping the environment\r\nclean of litter.
Patrols day in and day out! And the\noccasional battle!\c
In the embrace of Mother Nature, people and\nPokémon grow strong!\c
My, you are tough.
You can grow strong anywhere. It doesn’t matter\nwhere you are.
By battling tough opponents, both people and\nPokémon grow tough!\c
We’ve grown strong together in nature and in the\nconcrete jungle.\c\nWe make everywhere we go our playground!\c
You’re fantastically tough, aren’t you?!
Look around you at this wildly contorted terrain.\c\nIt’s no wonder that Pokémon would grow tough\nin a place like this.
I think I’m pretty tough, but so are you and\nyour Pokémon.\c\nLet’s have a battle to see who is the toughest!\c
Are you getting worn out from all the running\nyou’ve done?\c
You’re not tired at all?!
The world is full of Pokémon and all sorts\nof Trainers.
What do you think of the Battle Zone?\c\nYou’ve met so many Pokémon... I’ve got to battle\nyou again!\c
A Trainer riding a Pokémon! I like that!\nWe’ve gotta battle!\c
Awesome! You’re a real wild child!
Riding the waves on a Pokémon’s back...\nYeah, that’s something to talk about, all right.
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about\na rematch?\c
Check out my physique! The rough seas sculpted\nthis awesome body!\c
Muscles I have plenty of... But let’s not talk\nabout strength.
You’ve got wild Pokémon using a hidden move\nfor you... I find that really moving.
The rough seas here almost drowned—wait, no,\nshaped my physique! See how buff it is!\c
Check out my dynamic form! Victory is assured!\c
Oh. That’s how it is.
Being a good swimmer doesn’t make me any\nbetter as a Trainer...
Hi! You’re that kid who’s great with Pokémon!\c\nI’ll battle with an even more dynamic form than\nbefore! Watch me now!\c
My Pokémon and I are pumped up and ready\nto go all out!\c
Our muscles are deflating...
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!\nThat was our game plan...
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up! See, our\nmuscles are twitching!\c
People keep coming to us for battles. I really\ndon’t know why! Teehee!\c
OK, we lost.
I wanted to be alone, but after swatting away\nso many immature boys...\c\nWell, my Pokémon grew tough without me really\neven trying.
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!\c
Are your Pokémon growing?\c
Maybe they’re too grown up!
I’ve grown with my Pokémon, too. We’re better\nswimmers now than ever!
Did your Pokémon grow any more?\c\nHmm? My Pokémon? Mine are doing awesome!\c
I’m a mermaid who drifts among the waves...\c\nBut I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun\nwith Pokémon!\c
Losing brings tears to my eyes...
A mermaid’s tears are so salty...
I remain a mermaid who drifts among the waves...\c\nBut I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun\nwith Pokémon!\c
I want to be with my Water Pokémon.\nThat’s why I swim.\c
*glub glub*\nI’m going down!
Everyone I know says they have to train harder\nand more often. I thought so too, but I find it\r\nhard to get that serious about it.\c\nBeing with my Pokémon puts me in a mellow\nmood, I guess.
I want to be with my Water Pokémon.\nThat’s why I want to be stronger!\c
With one mighty flap, my birds blow away the\nembers of aggression!\c
We failed to get off the ground...
The hidden move Fly isn’t useful inside caves.\nIt’s such a shame.
Dragons and a fiery mountain... It’s a totally\nclassic setup!\c
Losing isn’t a happy occasion...
My Pokémon seem to like it here a lot.
Are you seeking the Legendary Pokémon here,\ntoo? Let’s battle, then!\c
I’ve got nothing left...
The Legendary Pokémon that sleeps deep in a\nvolcano... Could it be a dragon Pokémon?
What it means to win battles—that is what I seek.\nTeach me if you will!\c
I grow less certain still...
Perhaps there is no meaning to victory, but still\nI will battle! That is what makes me a Trainer!
Being with Pokémon makes me happy. And when\nwe win, I feel happier still!\c
We’re still happy even when we lose!
Raising Pokémon to the extremes... Having fun\nwith Pokémon...\c\nPeople should do whatever makes them happy.\nThat’s what I think!
I was born in Floaroma Town. I’m sure thrilled to\nbe here.\c\nIt took a long time to get here. We’re not going\nto lose again!\c
We went down... We couldn’t stick it out...
You can level all you want, but that won’t\nguarantee you any wins.\c\nBut we keep trying to get better. That’s what\nmakes us Trainers.
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather here aren’t\npushovers. They all have tricks up their sleeves!\c
You’re not a Trainer that can be taken lightly!
The Pokémon you’ll meet here won’t make it\neasy for you to move onward.
You’ve come all this way for Pokémon? You must\nbe dedicated.\c
Your dedication won out.
The Pokémon here must battle each other all the\ntime. That would explain why they are so strong.
My Pokémon and I are pretty nice, but not when\nit comes to a battle!\c
I couldn’t unleash the real me...
When you’re raising Pokémon, you need to be\nboth firm and gentle.
I came here after winning my way through the\nBattle Tower!\c
But I had a win streak going...
Train more at the Battle Tower... That’s what\nI’ll do.
We’re all good to go! We just have to battle now!\c
Aww... I’m out of useful items!
We came completely unprepared for this\nlittle adventure...
I had a revelation this morning. I knew that I\nwould have a wonderful encounter here today.\c
There’s nothing wonderful about this!
Is my sense of premonition nothing to write\nhome about?
I’ll use my mystifying psychic powers to\npulverize you!\c
That’s what I get for making idle claims...
Psychic power is a mystery that defies\nexplanation. But if everything could be\r\nexplained, it would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything. And you think\nyou can win?!\c
We weren’t up to the task!
Even though my team could break bricks and\nshatter boulders, they failed to dent your spirits!
Howdy! I’m crazy for karate! Hear the howl\nof my iron fists!\c
Losing made it clear to me—you’re crazy\nabout Pokémon!
I love seeing people who love Pokémon more\nthan anything!
What do you expect to achieve here? I’ll be the\none to make that call!\c
You’ve earned the right to be here—both you\nand your Pokémon.
You may find it odd, but the stink of sulfur from\nthe volcanic gas is what draws me here.
I just got worked over! And by a kid, no less...
Ugh! Again and again...
It is our mission to stall you. Sorry, but we gotta\ndo our job.\c
Losing was a part of my job, too... I feel better\nby saying that.
We won’t allow anyone to stop us from gathering\nthe three Pokémon from the three lakes.
In order for us to bring peace to the world,\nwe must control it!\c
You’re too young to understand.
Our boss always had plans for the three lakes.\c\nWhile you were blissfully ignorant, our work\nwent ahead...
I’ll knock your Pokémon into orbit!\c
My mind is going orbital!
The Pokémon here has already been taken to our\nHQ in Veilstone City.\c\nIt’s far too late for a child like you to make\nany difference.
If this mission is successful, we will get a\nnice bonus.\c
I’m heartbroken...
I want Team Galactic to become powerful.\nThat is all I want.
You, my friend, are tough! I can see why you\ndefy us so...
We set off the Galactic Bomb! Its blast force\nwas phenomenal!\c
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal power...
So, you’re tough. Big deal. What do you think\nyou can accomplish?\c\nThere’s one of you up against the entirety of\nTeam Galactic.\c\nBy now, another crew should be on their way to\nLake Verity near that puny little Twinleaf Town!
On behalf of our boss, I’ll punish you for defying\nTeam Galactic!\c
Grr... I’m the one who got punished in the end...
We’re Team Galactic! The number one syndicate\nin the world!\c\nTo defy us is to defy the universe!
...Would you like to join the Magikarp and flop\naround in the mud?\c
...Overwhelming!
I played you for a child, and paid a stiff price for\nmy arrogance...\c\nHowever, you’re much too late.\c\nTeam Galactic has already found the sunken\nisland under the lake—\c\nAnd the Pokémon that slumbers there?\nWell, where do you think it is now?
You’re tough, kid! But I still pity the likes of you.
Well, what have we here? A Trainer who’s lost\ntheir way?\c
You’re lost but you won! That burns me up\nto 11!
You barged right into our HQ? You must not\nknow what fear is, kid!
You’re the first intruder we’ve had in our HQ!\c
Oh, sure. Why don’t you just get all cocky\nabout it!
Without our special card key, you’re not going\nto get very far.\c\nWell, non-Team Galactic member? What’s your\nnext move?
Who do you think you are, desecrating the halls\nof our HQ?!\c
A tough little Trainer is what you are...
We get around in Galactic HQ by a system of\nround warp panels.\c\nDo you think you will ever learn the way they\nconnect? Good luck!
People like you just don’t understand why we do\nwhat we do.\c\nYou don’t understand Team Galactic, so why is it\nthat you defy us?!\c
I couldn’t understand the battle or\nyour toughness...
I went out of my way to deliver my cool lines\nbefore the battle!\c\nYou should’ve let me win! Get a grip on\nreality, already!
I’m, like, this close to getting my promotion\nto commander.\c\nI’ll impress our great boss by making you my\nnewest trophy!\c
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one...\c\nI’ll probably get bumped down to the gruntiest\nof the grunts... Humph!
I smell an intruder!\c
Oh, it was just my Pokémon that stunk...
We don’t stink! We’re on the cutting edge\nof stuff!
Having fun scampering around our HQ,\nyou sneaky intruder?\c\nYour trailblazing will go out in a blaze of glory\nright now!\c
Your trailblazing streak lives on!
So what, you have momentum... It’s too late.\nThe experiment’s done!
You should be tired out by now. It’s Team\nGalactic’s turn to shine!\c
What? I don’t get it. What’s your rush?
Pokémon are that important to you? Is that what\nthis is all about?
Are you enjoying your unescorted, unauthorized,\nand unsettling tour of Team Galactic HQ?\c
Let me do what I want!
It doesn’t matter what happens to the\nTeam Galactic HQ building.\c\nSoon, all will belong to Team Galactic!
Hey there, little Trainer! You’re famous among\nTeam Galactic.\c\nThe order has been issued—we get a promotion\nif we put you down!\c
I just blew my promotion...
What’s so special about you anyway?\c\nYou’re just like any other little kid Trainer\nanywhere else!
Our time has come! It’s Team Galactic’s\ntime now!\c
When’s it gonna be my turn...
It’s too late!\c\nNo amount of desperation from a kid like you\nwill make a difference!
Our time will come... A time for only us!\c\nI’m going to turn back your time to a time\nbefore Pokémon!\c
Gyah!
You can struggle all you want, but you can’t stop\nTeam Galactic alone!\c\nIt doesn’t matter how many Pokémon you try to\nuse as your tools!
Team Galactic is all-powerful!\c\nOnly a fool would show defiance to the mighty\nmight of Team Galactic!\c
Not standing up to the mighty is foolish,\nyou say...?
It doesn’t matter if you’re an adult or a kid if you\nhave Pokémon.\c\nPokémon are the equalizers. I should have\nrealized sooner...
I can’t believe you chased me here...\nOK, let’s see how tough you are.\c
Where do you get that power?!
Mount Coronet...\c\nI might only be a grunt, but even I can tell it has\na weird energy!
This is our final operation. No one will interfere!\c
You turned the tables on me! I call interference...
The closer you are to the peak, the closer you\nare to space!\c\nSoon, Team Galactic will... Uh... Team Galactic\nwill achieve greatness!
Team Galactic will take control of everything!\c\nYou can try all you want, but you can’t do\nanything alone!\c
All you gave me was the taste of defeat...
...Is our boss about to ditch us and claim\neverything for himself?
We grunts have been assigned two noble jobs—\c\nOne, to ensure the success of our operation at\nthe summit!\c\nAnd two, to utterly destroy anyone who\ndares interfere!\c
I don’t accept this! I will not accept this!
Join Team Galactic and then abide by our rules.\c\nThat would solve all our problems!
Say, listen, do you realize you’re breaking hearts\nby being successful?\c\nIt’s your fault that Team Galactic members are in\nso much pain...\c
See? You’ve left me brokenhearted, too...
One person’s joy is another person’s sorrow...\c\nEveryone should be happy and laughing?\nHow ridiculous!\c\nTeam Galactic should be doing all the laughing!
Our boss is going to do something huge at\nthe summit.\c\nBut here I am dealing with some pesky\nintruder...\c\nYou’re spoiling the atmosphere. You can lose\nquickly, right?\c
You’re not supposed to work me over like that.
All my excitement’s gone now...\c\nThis whole Mount Coronet trip is too rough,\nlong, and draining...
You’ve worked so hard to get here. You should\nbe proud of yourself!\c\nAnd now, I’ll send you packing with only that\nhappy thought!\c
Wha— How dare you! That’s how you respond to\nmy generosity?
We couldn’t stop you... We’ll be discarded\nas useless...\c\nOur boss is ruthless that way...
Oh yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!
What the—? We’re in trouble?! Well, I won’t give\nup so easily!
What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
Oh yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!

I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason\nto freak out.
We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot\nbecause we’re so tight!
What just went down?! My team still\nneeds raising?!

Not yet! Your first Pokémon League victory\ndoesn’t come easily, kid!
I will now concede defeat.\c\nBut I think you came to see how great Bug-type\nPokémon can be.\c\nI hope you also realized what you’re up against\nin the Pokémon League.\c\nBattling is a deep and complex affair...
Dear child, don’t assume for an instant that\nyou’ve won.
Well! Dear child, I must say, that was\nmost impressive.\c\nYour Pokémon believed in you and did their best\nto earn you the win.\c\nEven though I’ve lost, I find myself with this\nsilly grin!
I can feel your determination. Your will is\noverpowering me!
This situation is heating up! I’m blazing now!
Whoa!\c\nI wasn’t expecting this!\c\nI wasn’t looking down on you, but I didn’t think\nfor a second that I’d lose!\c\nThis is fantastic! You and your Pokémon\nare inspiring!
Hmm... Now what should I do...
I see...\c\nYou getting past the three before me was\nno fluke. Your power is real.
I can’t remember the last time I was put in a\ncorner like this!
I won’t let this end yet! This match is too fun to\nlet it end this easily!
Just a few minutes ago, you were the most\npowerful challenger.\c\nAnd just now, you became the most powerful of\nall the Trainers.\c\nYou are now our newest Champion!
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,\njust look!\c
Too strong! Too strong!
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,\njust look!\c
Too strong! Too strong!

Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to\nshow you my skill.\c\nThis time, I’ll show you why they consider me\nan ace!\c
I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
Ace Trainers always work to improve their\nnatural-born talents.\c
I see... I have to concede defeat.
Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it\nlike? What was it like?\c
You’re one enthusiastic Trainer.
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve\nbattled before, haven’t we?\c
You sure showed me up.
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me! ♪\c\nThat’s the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪\nYou sing, too!\c

I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the\nPokémon League.\c
I’m shocked... No, really, I am.
I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m headed for\nthe Pokémon League!\c
*blblblblugh*
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have\ntoughened me up more!\c
The world remains as harsh as ever...
It doesn’t matter how long it takes—I’m going to\nthe Pokémon League!\c
Th-this is so hard...
How much stronger have your Pokémon become?\nLet me check ’em out, OK?\c
I’ve had my fill...
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to\nbecome powerful.\c
Your battle style...
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to\nknow what all this means!\c
I see... So that’s what it means...
See? You’ve come back again.\c\nThere must be something that draws you here...\c
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather\nmarvelous indeed...
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an\nexcuse to slack off.\c\nI take pride in challenging those who have\nbested me before!\c
I see... Simply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,\nwe train here daily!\c
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out\nto be the Battle Zone...
I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s abilities!\c\nI’ve been looking forward to seeing you again!\c
Raising abilities alone doesn’t mean I can\nwin either...
I’ve discovered what’s missing from my battles—\nHave you discovered what’s missing from yours?\c
I see it now... I know what I lack.
The urge to battle you again has struck me.\nWant to humor me?\c
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge...
We’ve faced many challengers since we met,\nbut they were all weak...\c\nI relish the tough resistance that only you\ncan provide!\c
I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you...
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back—\njust like before.\c
Hmm...
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw!\c
What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an\nastonishingly cool way!\c
Right after this, I have to pay out your\nprize money...
This time—this time I will win! My spirit is\nrenewed and strong!\c
My spirit is broken...
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\c\nThat’s right. Harmony is essential!\c
You’re A-OK!
By battling tough opponents, both people and\nPokémon grow tough!\c
My, you are tough.
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about\na rematch?\c
Awesome! You’re a real wild child!
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!\c
OK, we lost.
Yeah, like I’m really supposed to win with a\nPokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the blizzards of\nSnowpoint City.\c\nWe’ll show you how it’s toughened us up!\c
What’s with your toughness?!
You’ve battled all over, you say? That makes you\ntough, perhaps.
I’ve only been involved with Pokémon for a\nshort time.\c\nI managed to get this far because skilled friends\ntoughened me up!\c
I can’t believe how tough you are!
If you have wonderful friends, there is no limit to\nhow far you can go.
Our mission is to implement our operations\nwithout question.\c\nIt is all for the new world order that our boss\nwill lead!\c
This won’t go unpunished...
I’m quite prepared to do anything to\nbe promoted.\c\nOne day, and soon, you will learn the true might\nof Team Galactic!
I won’t let you disrupt our research! This is for\nTeam Galactic!\c
I got whipped... I look pathetic...
Our boss is a scientific genius!\c\nHe will make the power of Legendary Pokémon\nhis own!
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the-art facility!\c\nA snot-nosed kid like you ought to keep your\ndirty hands to yourself!\c
You and your Pokémon weren’t part of\nmy calculations...
Our boss is trying to create an entirely\nnew world.\c\nA world only for us! For Team Galactic!
Bika bikabika! Pigachu!\c
Pikachu...
Pika...\c\nI’ll need a lot more practice to become a\nreal Pikachu...
I work at a red-hot foundry. Watch out,\nI’m on fire!\c
I burned out...
I toughened up my muscles from honest work.\nPokémon have nothing on me!
Well! It’s not often we get a visitor like you to\nthe ironworks!\c\nLet’s mark the occasion with a battle!\c
Fire!
The floor panels move automatically.\nWe’re pretty proud of them here!
Are you maybe getting annoyed by where the\nfloor panels take you?\c
I’m going down in flames!
The sweat of a working man is beautiful\nto behold...\c\nThere is also beauty in the tears wept\nfrom defeat...
The toughest of all the grunts! That was me...
Arrgh! I let some little kid beat me!
Sheesh... I should have done the fighting myself.
Humph! You’ve toughened up. But you’re no\nmatch for our boss.
Done in by two kids?! This isn’t right!
I should have kept my head down and just\nwatched our warehouse...
Fweh... If I didn’t run...I could’ve...\nbattled harder...
My last Pokémon.
I see... I may lose if this pace continues...
Interesting. And quite curious.
I admit that you have pushed me to this extreme.
This... This cannot be! It’s not possible that I lose!
I won’t accept this! The power spoken of\nin mythology...\c\nI didn’t just make it obey me, I made it my own!
I feel like crying... This is so sad...
What a tough combination! I can’t believe it!
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!
What just went down?! You’re telling me I\nlost again?!
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!

If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...

Here comes my trump card! Witness the true\nstrength of Rock types!
No way! Not yet! Not giving up!
Wh-what? It can’t be! Even that wasn’t enough?
Don’t you think it’s natural to save your best\nfor last?
This is where the battle really begins!
Wow! You’ve totally bested me!
Oh? Could this really be my last?
Fight! You can do it!
Bravo!
Ah! This is an awful lot of pressure!
My victory will be all the more meaningful when\nI get out of this tight spot!
I admit defeat...
Well done indeed! Not many can capsize me!
Waves of excitement are crashing over me!
What’s this? It seems I’ve run out of Pokémon!
What, you think you’ve got me cornered?
It’s not over! Steel only gets stronger with every\nhit it takes!
Hmm! That was an impressive battle!
OK, it’s time to focus!
I worked hard to get this far! There’s no way I’m\ngiving up now!
You sure are impressive—you even made me lose\nmy focus!
Fantastic! I’m getting jolts of excitement from\nthis battle!
The harder I’m pressed, the more fun I have!\nI’m coming at you with full power!
Hahahahahah! A total loss... I feel so refreshed!

Look, Cheryl! I can see the exit!
Oh? Mira, don’t you think that was easier\nthan expected?
Huh? How do we find the exit?
We really just want to get to the exit...
Ohohoho!\c\n<size=250%>Ohohoho!</size>
Well, what did you think of that? That’s the\npower of a great duo!
We have lost.
Oof...
A kid’s just a kid, after all...
Humph. That’s all you’ve got?
Gah! You’re tough, kid.
Humph! You’re not too bad, I suppose...
We did it, Maylene! Our focus came out on top!
I’m so hungry... Oh, no, I didn’t say anything!
You really are great! I can’t help but respect you\neven more!
*gurgle*
Nothing good comes of cutting corners.
You’re the best, just the way you are...
I guess we should have prepared more...
Thanks for the battle.
Yeah! I’m one step ahead of you!
Yeah! I really am the greatest Trainer ever!
Ahahaha! You still have some learning to do.
Whoops! You got me!
Ahahaha! Well done indeed!
Didn’t quite get your flames going hot\nenough, eh?
I wasn’t exactly bored, but that battle was\ndefinitely missing something.
That was a raging hot battle!
What an electrifying battle. I can’t get enough!
So...how does it feel to lose?
Such a waste of my time... Is that really the best\nyou can do?
That can’t be! I lost?!
How? How?! HOW?!
I won! I finally defeated [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt was me... I did it... which means... I’m the\ngreatest Pokémon Trainer in the world!
That was a close one, and a fantastic\nPokémon battle!\c\nI know you’ll become even more skilled.\nPlease come and challenge me again!
Wha—? This is a joke, right? This can’t\nbe happening!
Spectacular! Truly spectacular!
Yup, that’s the power of Rock-type Pokémon!
Wh-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
Didja see that? Grass-type Pokémon really grow\nup strong and healthy!
That’s it, then! I lost!
I guess strength can be rather short-lived!
Um... It seems I’ve lost.
Gwahahaha! All my training on Iron Island has\npaid off!
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
Eheheh! Dignified enough for you?
You really are mighty! Yup, Candice lost!
Ohohoho!\c\n<size=250%>Ohohoho!</size>
Oh! I missed a step!
All right. That’s got my heart rate steady again.
Outstanding! I acknowledge your electrifying win!
Yes! That’s a W-I-N...for Crasher Wake!
WHAAAT?! I think it’s fair to say that you\nabsolutely demolished me!
An admirable attempt! I could feel your passion\nfor battle. Let’s do this again sometime!
That was excellent. You have a beautiful way\nof battling!
A fierce bout that was!\c\nI can definitely tell that you’re serious about this.\nCome back and try again any time!
A magnificent bout that was! You really are the\npinnacle of Trainers!
Not yet! We’ll keep struggling till the very end!
A bug Pokémon’s life force is nothing to sneer at!
Guess I was still one step behind... You’ve won.
I lost completely. But I think you’ve come to\nrealize how great bug Pokémon can be.
Ahahaha! Victory may be in sight, but take care\nnot to lose your footing!
No matter where you stand, you can always\ncount on the ground beneath your feet.
That was quite something. Your youth gives you\na confidence in battle that can’t be shaken.
I’m very impressed. Your strength shook me like\na tremor from the earth itself.
Hey! I’m about to go full throttle!
Things are getting so hot, I can see heat waves!
Incredible! Your moves are so hot, they make\nmine look lukewarm!
Unbelievable! What burning passion!\c\nYou’re like the sun to your own solar system,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!
Hmm... How might I turn this situation to\nmy advantage?
Here comes my masterstroke! This is the moment\nthe tables turn!
I see... It appears you’ve put me in checkmate.
So it goes. You held the whole course of the\nbattle in the palm of your hand.
Who knew getting backed into a corner could\nbe so much fun?
No, not yet! I won’t let you end things this easily!
That went well beyond my wildest expectations!\nWhat an exceptional battle!
That went above and beyond my expectations.\nWhat a marvelous battle.
And so we prove that the strongest and most\namazing of all is...actually you!

More than singing! More than dancing!\nI love Pokémon! So, shall we battle?
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me!\c
Aww, that’s heartbreaking... I’m an idol, too...
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for\nbeing such a fan!\c\nJust so you know, our latest single is called\n“Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
I’m working on a story. Can you battle me?
Join me for a live report!\c
Press coverage denied... But you’re so intriguing!
Interviews are about taking the initiative.
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! Is it OK to go\nfor the scoop?
As a professional cameraman, I always go for the\nbest shot!\c
That’s a downer... I thought I’d found a Trainer\nand Pokémon who’d shine on camera.
The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon’s faces make for some great TV!
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am!\nAren’t you having fun? Let’s make it fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this? Shall we try\nsomething fantastical?\c
Oh, how shall I say this? It makes me all lonely,\nI say...
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while\nlaughing. It defines what we do!
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d get\na great shot here.
Oh! You’re ready for a battle with us?
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK?\c
OK, that’s how it is, huh. Can’t do anything\nabout that.
I’d like to take that footage and have it\nbroadcast worldwide.
Oh, no. What we really want to see is you in\naction with two Pokémon!
*giggle*\nWill you have a battle with us?
We’ll thoroughly check you out as a Trainer!\c
Oh, too bad! I wanted to check out\nyour Pokémon!
I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We made a\nwonderful spectacle!
Po-Po-Pokémon!\c\nI want to become more like a Pikachu! Will you\nbattle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\c
Pikachu!
I need to get more into the character of\na Pokémon...
Come on, time to show off our Pokémon!\nLet’s do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit’s giving off some seriously cool vibes...\nI can tell that you totally rock!\c
Now, that is seriously uncool. You have to let\nyour passion burn!
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit,\ntoo! That’s what makes a battle rock!
Battling is the best way to learn! Can we get a\nbattle with you?
Go, my Pokémon, go!\c
Aww! But battling is the best way to learn\nabout Pokémon!
It’s hard to win if you don’t have some Pokémon\nto choose from.
Whew! You’re really good. We’ve been studying\nevery day, but we were no match at all!\c\nYou’d be able to use these Technical Machines\nproperly. Here you go!\c
If you boot up TM10, you can use it to teach\nWork Up to a Pokémon.\c\nA Pokémon that uses Work Up in battle will raise\nits Attack and Sp. Atk at the same time.\c\nBut remember—a TM is good for one use only.\nDon’t waste it!
I just became friends with my Pokémon.\c\nI’m not sure if we can do this properly, but may\nwe battle?
I need to try the things I learned before I\nforget them!\c
Boo! Where’s your sense of adventure?\c\nDon’t be shy about talking to people and getting\ninto battles!
Do you think we would have done better if I\nused Potions?
We were actually confident that we would do\npretty good. But I’m completely impressed by\r\nhow tough you are.\c\nIf you’d like, talk to my friend and get some\nTechnical Machines from him.
Before we make our toast, I’d hoped for a battle.\c\nHowever, you seem to be short a Pokémon\nfor that.
If you want to have a battle with us, you’ll need\nto bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for my model,\nI am sure to paint a masterpiece!\c
What is it? Do you wish for a battle?\c
Though we lost our battle... A toast to your\nbeauty, which no painting could ever hope\r\nto capture!
He said he’d treat me to a dinner here if I agreed\nto model for him. So, I came along, but I haven’t\r\nmade up my mind yet.\c
When I can’t decide, I battle to help make the\ndecision! How about it?\c
I’ve decided to model for him. That’s given me\nan appetite!
There is no price too high for the sake of my art.\c\nThat said... My oh my, these meals look\nawfully pricey...\c
What is it? Are you feeling hungry, too?\nOh, I see. That’s not it—you wanted a battle!\c
My hors d’oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these delicious\nhors d’oeuvres. I don’t want to be all bloated\r\nby the time the main dish comes.\c
I’d like a light battle to work up my appetite.\nWould you care to join us?\c
The hors d’oeuvres haven’t grown cold...\nThese are supposed to be served chilled!
The worth of a meal isn’t determined merely\nby its flavor.\c\nPresentation—that is, color and placement—\nis vital.\c\nIn other words, a fine meal can be likened to the\nfinest work of art...\c
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope to see\nbeauty. You do agree with me, yes?\c
The meals prepared here are not merely\nhealthy—they are also tasty. Diners need not\r\nworry about finding just what they want here.
Today’s main dish is scrumptiously delicious!\nIf I can keep eating this food, I’ll model anytime!\c
I feel guilty just eating all this delicious food\nlike this. I’ll join the battle, too!\c
The models of great paintings all look very\ndifferent. That means I don’t need to worry\r\nabout fitting in!
If you want to challenge us, bring some\nmore Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have to have at\nleast two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be the chef here.\c
What is it you want, a battle? Bahaha...\nYou think you can beat us?\c
We’ve lost, but let’s make a toast to our future\ntogether anyway!
Oh, my! Your father is the chef here?\nHow wonderful!\c
I haven’t told him, but my father owns the hotel\nand restaurant...\c\nOh, but that’s beside the point. Would you care\nfor a battle?\c
Let’s toast to the prosperity of the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father—these hors\nd’oeuvres are delicious!\c
Are you asking me for a battle? Well, certainly!\nI never back down from a challenge!\c
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying our meal\nwithout disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to serve at\nthe hotel.\c
My papa owns this restaurant, but please don’t\ntell my date—his father works here as a chef.\c\nI’ll have a battle with you if you keep your\nmouth shut.
My date did his best, but you were better than\nthe both of us.
Heh! My date’s really enjoying Father’s cooking.\nShe has a dreamy expression after every bite!\c
I’m feeling great! Sure, I’ll have a battle with you.\nThat’s why you approached us, right?\c
My prowess as a Trainer isn’t up to snuff...\nIt’s not like my father’s scrumptious cooking.
This succulent flavor! It reminds me of a world\ntrip I took. My papa and I traveled everywhere,\r\ndining at only the best restaurants.\c
Eating this fabulous meal has really lifted my\nspirits. Join us for a battle?\c
Your father’s cooking has a very magical quality\nto it. It seems to perk people up with energy.
If your intention is to test your skill on us,\nI daresay you ought to bring at least one\r\nother Pokémon.
Oh, you’re offering to do battle with us?\nHow nice of you.\c\nUnfortunately, you simply cannot battle us both\nwith just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many more happy\nyears together.\c
Since I took my retirement, I’ve been traveling\nwith my wife. We both enjoy searching for\r\ndelicious dining experiences.\c\nYou seem to enjoy battling with Pokémon.\nAm I right?\c
Well, so much for that. Let’s try to enjoy the rest\nof our meal.
To our health, our welfare, and fine\ndining! Cheers!\c
A toast before a meal helps stimulate the\nappetite, I find.\c\nBut that’s neither here nor there. You wanted a\nbattle, surely?
Gourmet dining in restaurants and exhilarating\nPokémon battles...\c\nThere is so much contentment in my life!
Hmm! Now, this is special! It looks like it was just\nquickly warmed through, but in reality, much care\r\nhas gone into its preparation!\c
When one gets to be an accomplished gourmet\nlike myself, one can tell at a glance if a dish is\r\ndelicious or not.\c\nYou would battle against such discerning taste?\c
Well, so much for that. We’ll keep a stiff upper\nlip and look forward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d’oeuvres are simply divine!\nThey tell me that I can expect the main\r\ncourse to be fantastic!\c
I thought the main course arrived already...\nYou’re a Trainer seeking battle?\c
The hors d’oeuvres were most excellent!
Mmm! The chef flambéed this to perfection!\nThe rich aromas and flavors fill my mouth\r\nwith joy!\c
You’re throwing down a challenge in the middle\nof our meal? I would say you’re a very dedicated\r\nTrainer, especially for one so young!\c
Ah... I’m very satisfied with our meal and\nour battle.
Mmm, this sauce!\c\nIt’s a spicy sauce made Hoenn-style from grated\nCheri Berries!\c
Would you like to sample a bite...? Oh, right.\nPokémon battle?\c
Battling is fine, of course. But personally, I would\nrather be out enjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you’ll have to bring at\nleast two Pokémon.
Don’t you have more than one Pokémon?\nWe’ll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er... Thank you for coming today.\nShould we make a toast?\c
She’s the girl from the Pokémon supply store I go\nto all the time. We’re incredibly happy together.\r\nWould you like to battle us?\c
Oh, gosh. I’m sorry we lost, Alison. You’re not\nupset, are you?
Hee hee... Eugene, you act so different from the\nway you do at the store. You’re surprisingly shy.\c
I work at a Pokémon supply store because I\nlove Pokémon.\c\nMy job lets me be with Pokémon all day long,\nso it naturally made me pretty decent at battling.\r\nWant to try us?\c
I don’t worry much about winning or losing.\nI keep my Pokémon with me because I love it!
If my Pokémon buddies heard I went on a date\nwith you, Alison...they’d probably hate me for it.\c
Are you Alison’s fan, too?
Alison, seeing your smiling face... I can’t tell if\nthese appetizers are delicious or not!
Sorry, what? A date? Um, Eugene... You are a\nvalued customer and all, but I just don’t know...\c
I know I’m being indecisive, but I have to admit—\nhis invitation was just too flattering to refuse.\c\nI’ll let my Pokémon decide for my fickle heart.\nLet’s battle?\c
You know, it’s true what they say—there is no\nevil among Pokémon fans! That goes for you\r\nand Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here. Please enjoy\nyourself—I’ve got the bill covered today!\c
I’ll defeat you and collect the prize money!\c
My wallet’s empty after paying the prize money...\c\nOh, no, it’s OK! No need to worry! I still have my\nsecret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you’re a little awkward,\nbut you’re very earnest.\c
If I team up with my date, it might make for an\ninteresting combination.\c\nI think we could battle in an intriguing manner.\nDo you?\c
The meal was delicious, and our battle was so\nmuch fun. I really insist that we split the bill.
If you had two Pokémon, I’d take you on with\nmy mom.
I’m willing to have a battle with my son,\nmy pride and joy.\c\nBut you must bring more Pokémon than that.
What should I have today? Juice, ice cream,\ncake, and, and...\c
Oh, hi, Trainer! Want to battle Pokémon with us\nbefore we have a yummy dinner?\c
I don’t get it. Grown-ups always have a toast\nbefore eating. But why don’t I see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you for doing\nwell on your test.\c\nYou may order anything you like. It’s your\nreward, dearest!\c
Did you know? My boy is not only a genius\nat school, but he’s also a Pokémon prodigy!\r\nWould you like to challenge us and see?\c
I wish to propose a toast. May my darling\nEsteban get another 100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish at a time!\nIt’s not like how it is at home!\c
I do my homework while eating, so I can\nbattle anytime!\c
We’re going to eat this delicious stuff now.\nBye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the town for its\ndelicious food.\c
I beg your pardon? You want to battle now?\nWell, all right. It’s not as if I dislike battling.\c
Thank you for letting my dear son experience an\ninvaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go out to eat like this?\nI mean, without taking their kids along.\c
Well, that’s OK. It’s way more fun for me to\nbattle than go eat fancy dinners!\c
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban. We’re here\nto celebrate your great grades!\c
Oh? A battle, you say? Well, certainly. Why not?\c
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle together.\nNone of that one-on-one nonsense.
I can battle against you with my dad. But first,\nplease bring more Pokémon.
Here’s a toast for your mother. May she always\nbe healthy!\c
My wife’s in the hospital waiting for the baby\nto arrive. Since I can’t cook, I came here with\r\nmy daughter.\c\nHow would you like a battle with us before\nwe eat?\c
The house will be a lot noisier when your mother\ncomes home with the new baby.
I wonder what Mom will bring home—a baby\nbrother, or a baby sister?\c
Whether it’s a boy or a girl, I’m going to be their\nbig sister—so I should get better at Pokémon!\c
Little babies cry like Pokémon! Piyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers. This is just\nso extravagant.\c
I’m no cook. I’ll admit that freely.\c\nBut battling Pokémon... There’s something I’m\ncomfortable with.\c
Let’s get over the sting of that loss by enjoying\nthis delicious meal!
Wow! This food looks really fancy!\c
Papa is a rotten cook, so we get to go out and\neat good food like this! Did you come to this\r\nrestaurant to battle Pokémon?\c
I’ve never eaten anything like this before.
Here’s the main dish!\c
What is it? Did you want to battle with us?\c
Blythe, I hope the new baby will grow up to be\nas kindhearted as you.
I wish Mom were here to eat with us...\c
My mom gave me my Pokémon. Want to see how\ntough they are?\c
Next time, let’s all come here together—\neven the baby!
What’s up? Did you want to be on TV, too?\nOh, right, sorry! You wanted to battle!\c\nYou’d be battling the two of us. You need at\nleast two Pokémon for that.
If you want an autograph, you’ll have to wait till\nwe finish filming.\c\nOh, and if you want to battle, bring two\nPokémon, OK?
Let’s start with a shot of the drinks as a\ncamera test.\c
Huh? You’re inviting us to battle at a time\nlike this?\c
Oh, man... Our drinks are lukewarm now.
Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed juice\nmade from ripened Pecha Berries picked\r\nthis morning!\c
Pardon? A Pokémon battle? OK, a quick one\nbefore we do any filming for the show.\c
Do you think we should rehearse this one\nmore time?\c\nToday’s featured drink is freshly squeezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look delicious.\nWill someone bring me a mist spray so they look\r\neven fresher?\c
Thanks, that was quick! Wait... Where’s the\nmist spray?\c\nOh, you want a battle? Whatever, then. I’m up\nfor your challenge!\c
Photographing food isn’t easy. It’s actually\nvery technical.
These look fabulous, too. We need the camera\nto zoom in more!\c
Please don’t talk to me while we’re filming!\c\nOh, actually, hold on. A Trainer barges in on our\nfine dining experience...\c\nI like that! It adds drama to our story!\c
Darling Darryl, are you ready? When I take a\nbite, I want a close-up of my lips. All right?
Whoa... So this is the main dish? Yowza! Let’s get\nthis filming done quick so I can chow down, too!\c
You’ve been sniffing around a lot... Are you\nmessing with our filming?\c
Oh, no... Everything’s gone cold while we\nwere battling.
*chomp*\c\nMmm... This is...light, and yet rich-flavored...\nIt delectably melts away... A hint of an aftertaste,\r\nyet crisp... Neither too sweet nor too bitter...\r\nMy words can’t do this justice!\c
It’s not easy trying to describe food while you’re\neating. But I can battle anytime during filming!\c
Do you know what the most important thing is\nfor gourmet reporting?\c\nIt’s a...thesaurus-like vocabulary!
I’ll only say this once, so listen closely. I’ll even\nsay it slowly—to battle against two Trainers,\r\nyou need two or more Pokémon.\c\nNow if you were to bring more Pokémon, I could\nconsider a battle...
Oh, you’ll have to bring more Pokémon than that\nto battle us!
And that’s another brilliant day on the markets!\nA toast to my Lady Luck!\c
Since I’ve been with her, I’ve been riding a hot\nstreak on the markets.\c\nI’m surfing on a wave of good luck! You’re sure\nyou want to battle us?\c
This is just a minor setback. I can easily make up\nfor this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again? You haven’t\nguessed wrong yet!\c
My boyfriend’s a stock market wizard!\c\nDid you know? Someone who’s that lucky also\nhappens to make for a tough Trainer.\c\nAre you willing to try your luck against that?\c
It’s just one loss. We can make that back with a\nbig win next time!
There’s no need for technique. You just have to\nread what’s in your opponent’s heart.\c
Now, when I say “heart,” I don’t mean what a\nperson is thinking. It’s about how they want to\r\nbe perceived.\c\nDo you... Would you like me to think of you as a\ntough Trainer?\c
I had a bad feeling about this Trainer...
No, really? Wooow, that is so neat! How can you\ntell these things?\c
My boyfriend could tell that deep down,\nI’m actually a frightened and lonely child!\c\nI don’t think I could ever lose with him.\nWant to test that theory?\c
It’s amazing that you predicted you would lose!
Let’s savor this extravagant meal and think of\nwhat it represents. We can use that as motivation\r\nto keep winning at life!\c
Personally, I think there are two kinds of people:\nthose who face up to any challenge, and those\r\nwho duck and cover.\c\nYou’re the type who faces up to any challenge,\nam I right?\c
If I had the power of premonition, I’d be a terror\non the markets.\c\nBut you know that’s not really possible.
How can you guess right about everything all\nthe time?\c\nDo you really have the power of premonition?\c
I’m convinced that he has some extrasensory\npower or something.\c\nIf I’m teaming up with a guy like that, are you\nsure you want to do this?\c
If it’s not premonition, did you...maybe come\nfrom the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you want to battle\nagainst us.
If you’d bring two or more Pokémon, we could\nhave a battle with you.
Hmm. This beverage’s coloration borders on the\npositively toxic... However, my analysis indicates\r\nthat it is composed of natural ingredients.\c
What is it? You are...? Oh, yes, a Trainer.\c
The results of that battle are insignificant.\nLet’s celebrate.
Oh, dear! I wish you wouldn’t!\c\nWe’re at a fancy restaurant, and you want to\nanalyze what’s served?\c
Oh, you’re a Trainer?\c
Cheers, dear! Please don’t start analyzing what\nwe just drank!
Interesting. These hors d’oeuvres are fascinating.\nPlant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%.\r\nCuriouser and curiouser...\c
What is it now? Do you want me to analyze your\nskill level?\c
I feel compelled to analyze that which is\nunknown to me. By defining its composition,\r\nI feel reassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way? It takes the\nmagic out of a meal. I wish you wouldn’t think\r\nabout your research while we’re out eating!\c
My husband never ceases to amaze me with his\ndedication to research.\c\nWould you care to have a battle with us?\c
If you were to ask me, I’d rather not know about\nwhat I don’t understand. It’s simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish should have\narrived by now. Perhaps the thermal setting is\r\ntoo low to prepare the food efficiently?\c
You there! Let’s battle to consume time!\c
They brought the main course while we were\nbattling... The calorie content appears to be\r\nalarmingly high.
There isn’t any point getting impatient over the\nfood, dear. Isn’t this the sort of situation that you\r\nbrought your Pokémon for?\c
Oh, what good timing! Would you join us for a\nquick battle?\c
Don’t fret, dear. If we take in too many calories,\nwe can always work them off by battling!
Does this mean I’m only talented as an artist?
You’re a lucky one...
I never thought I’d lose at Father’s restaurant...
Oh... How could I lose at dear Papa’s restaurant?
Ack! I lost... Check, please!
So young, and yet so strong!\nHow very remarkable!
I don’t care if I lose. I’m still a happy guy.
Waaah! You’re too much!
Wow... You’re out there.
No one’s hurt?
Tough, aren’t you...?
I was with my dad, too...
That’s quite the demonstration.
Hmm... I should have expected this.
My luck’s run out...
I think I have what it takes to become a\nsuccessful model!
Hmm... I failed to foresee this outcome.
You know, I had confidence before heading\ninto this.
Oh snap! That’s how it is, then?
I like to study a lot. I thought I could win...

Hm! This fisher puts no spine into holding the\nrod. The lack of passion is obvious!\c\nThis Trainer rates only a generous 5 out of 100!\c[VAR 0114(004A)]
Ouch! Just 5 points! [VAR 0100(0000)], try harder!\c\nUntil next time, keep on fishing![VAR 0114(0009)]

Here you earn a number rating\nthat shows where you stand among the competition.\nFor a fixed period of time, you’ll battle numerous other\nTrainers, and those battles will make your rating go up\nor down. Unlike other battle modes, it’s up to you to\nsearch out and select a competition you’ll choose to\ntake part in.
The Dynamax Phenomenon
In the Galar region, Pokémon can become far larger\nthan usual in certain places. This transformation is\ncalled “Dynamaxing.” Press the <color=#FF5000FF>Dynamax button\n</color>when your Dynamax Band lights up to Dynamax\nyour Pokémon.
Your Pokémon can only Dynamax for <color=#FF5000FF>three turns</color>!\nDuring that time, your Dynamax Pokémon can use\nextremely powerful moves known as <color=#FF5000FF>Max Moves</color>.\nThese Max Moves not only deal tremendous damage—\nthey can also trigger special effects! The exact effect\nchanges depending on the type of the move used.\nChoose carefully when to Dynamax your Pokémon, and\nsmash your way to victory!
Pokémon Camp
In your Pokémon Camp, you and your Pokémon can\nplay together and even eat together, growing closer\nthrough the experience! If your Pokémon grow very\nclose to you, they may even try extra hard for you\nduring battle!
You can play using your Joy-Con, too! If you slide\nyour Joy-Con off your system, you can wave one\nabout to throw a ball for your Pokémon to retrieve\nor wave a Poké Toy for their delight. If you waggle\nthat Poké Toy, you might even entice Pokémon\nhanging out farther back in your camp to come play!
When you set up camp in the Wild Area, you’ll be\nable to play with up to three other Trainers at a time.\nAll kinds of people and Pokémon might stumble upon\nyour camp, even those you’ve never met before,\nso get to know them as you play together!
Cooking at Camp
Cook up a fine curry while out camping by selecting\ningredients and Berries of your liking!\nYour curries will get more delicious if you choose to\ndo things like using rare ingredients or adding lots\nof Berries, too.
Once you start cooking, fan the flames with your fan\nto keep things hot enough, and stir things up with your\nladle to keep ’em moving. Only don’t go overboard—\nyou don’t want to spill! The last step will be to add a\nbit of soul into it at just the right timing, and you’ll\nhave made a masterpiece for your Pokémon to enjoy!
After you finish cooking, it’ll be time for everyone to\ndig in together. Eating a tasty curry can have a number\nof effects on the Pokémon that are at your camp,\nincluding restoring their HP and making them feel\nmore friendly toward you!
Pokémon Dens
The pillars of red light you’ll see in the Wild Area\nmark Pokémon Dens. Dynamax Pokémon dwell in\nthese dens, and you’ll be able to battle them by\ninvestigating the den. You can start the battle on your\nown or get up to three other players to help you out!
Max Raid Battles
Defeat a Dynamax Pokémon, and you’ll get a chance\nat catching it!\nAdditionally, there are some rare items that you can\nonly obtain by battling Dynamax Pokémon!
When wild Pokémon Dynamax, they become\nincredibly powerful. They may unleash multiple moves\nin a row and take other actions you won’t see in a\nregular battle. Working together with other Trainers\nwill be key as you take on these Dynamax Pokémon\ntogether as a team of four.
The Flying Taxis
If you use the Flying Taxi service, one of their\nwell-trained Corviknight will have you zipping across\nthe Galar region to your desired destination in no\ntime at all! Just open up the X menu, and use the\nTown Map to choose where you want to go!
Pokémon Boxes
You can keep extra Pokémon in your Pokémon Boxes.\nYou’ve got your own Boxes in the Pokémon storage\nsystem, which you can access at the Rotom Information\nterminals (Rotomi) found in Pokémon Centers\neverywhere. You can retrieve Pokémon from your\nBoxes at any Rotomi you visit, too!
Poké Jobs
Pokémon are in high demand as helpers in the Galar\nregion, and you’re able to send your own Pokémon\nout to help out on jobs!\nThe Pokémon you send out will grow stronger from\nthe experience they gain!
The job postings will be updated every day.\nGood things will begin to happen if you send lots of\nPokémon to many jobs, so keep an eye out for new\npostings and help out as much as you can!
The Gym Challenge
The Gym Challenge is an event in which aspiring\nTrainers travel around the Galar region to try to\ncollect Gym Badges from eight of its Gyms.\nTo earn a Gym Badge, you have to complete that\nGym’s mission and also defeat its Gym Leader.
Live Competitions
Live Competitions let you gather together with others\nand have competitions with one another.\nThese can be casual Friendly Competitions, which are\nhosted among friends, or Official Competitions.\nIf you want to find out about current or upcoming\nOfficial Competitions, check out Pokémon’s\nofficial website.

Ranks are sorted into different tiers. Once you reach\na new tier, you won’t fall back down into a lower tier,\neven if you lose in your Ranked Battles.\nFor example, once you’ve reached the Ultra Ball Tier,\nyou won’t fall back down into the Great Ball Tier,\nregardless of how many battles you lose.
Ranked Battles are held during set periods.\nEach of these set periods is called a season.\nOnce one season ends, a new season will begin.\nWhen a new season begins, all players will have their\nranks lowered. At this time only, you might find that\nyou’ve moved down a tier.
The players who reach the highest rank in Ranked\nBattles will no longer battle to reach a higher rank, but\ninstead to see where they place among the best.\nA Trainer’s place in the highest rank will go up or down\nbased on the results of their battles.
Online Competitions
Online Competitions can be broken down into two\ncategories: Official Competitions and\nFriendly Competitions.
In Official Competitions, you take part in special\nbattles with a variety of different rules and restrictions\nin order to see where you place.\nDetails about the schedule for these competitions and\nrestrictions on what Pokémon you can use in them are\nannounced on Pokémon’s official website.
